ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

SECTION 1.1  _The Offer_.

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Unless this Agreement shall have previously
been terminated in accordance with  _Article VIII_ , and _provided_ that the
Company shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations
under _Section 1.2_, Merger Sub shall commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to
purchase all of the outstanding Shares at a price per Share equal to the Offer
Price as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, but no
later than the tenth (10th) Business Day after the initial public announcement
of the execution of this Agreement (which initial public announcement shall
occur no later than the first (1st) Business Day following execution and
delivery of this Agreement).

 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligation of Merger Sub to, and
of Parent to cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay for Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction (or
waiver by Parent and Merger Sub) of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_
hereto (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to waive any of the
Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum Condition), to increase the price per
Share payable in the Offer and to make any other changes in the terms of
the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that no change may be made without the
prior written consent of the Company that (i) other than in accordance with
_Section 1.1(h)_, decreases the price per Share payable in the Offer, (ii)
changes the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer, (iii) reduces the
maximum number of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) imposes
conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, (v)
amends, modifies or waives the Minimum Condition, (vi) modifies or amends any
of the Offer Conditions in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares or
(vii) except as provided in _Section 1.1(c)_, extends the Initial Offer
Expiration Date.

 



2 (c) _Expiration and Extensions of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at 9:30 a.m., New York time, on the later of (x) the
twenty-first (21st) Business Day following the commencement of the Offer
(calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange
Act) (the " _Initial Offer Expiration Date_ ") and (y) the second (2nd)
Business Day following the Go Shop Agreement Cut-Off Date; _provided_ that (i)
if at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, any Offer Condition is not
then satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement and applicable
Law, waived, then Merger Sub shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions
for consecutive periods of at least two (2) Business Days but no more
than ten (10) Business Days, each as determined by Parent in its sole
discretion, or for such longer period(s) as Parent and the Company may
otherwise agree, up until the Walk-Away Date in order to permit such Offer
Condition(s) to be satisfied and (ii) if, less than five (5) Business Days
prior to any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer (A) Parent (either
directly or through its Subsidiaries) shall have received the cash proceeds of
the Debt Financing (or any Alternate Debt Financing) and/or Parent (either
directly or through its Subsidiaries) shall have entered into Definitive
Financing Agreements, collectively in an amount at least equal to the Required
Amount, which amount will be available to Parent (either directly or through
its Subsidiaries) at the Offer Closing, subject only to consummation of the
Offer Closing and the Closing and (B) all of the Offer Conditions have been
satisfied or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement and applicable Law,
waived, then Merger Sub shall have the right to extend the Offer for a period
of up to five (5) Business Days; _provided, further_ , that such extension
shall be subject to Merger Subs right to terminate the Offer and pursue
the Merger in connection with a Conversion Event in accordance with _Section
1.1(f)_ and the parties respective rights to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VIII_. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing contained in
this  _Section 1.1(c)_, Merger Sub shall be required to extend the Offer on
one or more occasions for the minimum period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") or the staff thereof or of the New York Stock Exchange applicable to
the Offer; _provided, however_ , that such extension shall be subject to
Merger Subs right to terminate the Offer and pursue the Merger in connection
with a Conversion Event in accordance with _Section 1.1(f)_ and the parties
respective rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , and
nothing contained herein shall require Merger Sub to extend the period during
which the Offer remains open to any date after the Walk-Away Date. The
"Initial Offer Expiration Date" as it may be extended is referred to as the "
_Offer Expiration Date._ " Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this _Section 1.1_, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1_, then Merger Sub shall promptly (and, in any event, within one (1)
Business Day after such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer.

(d) _Subsequent Offering Period_. If, as of the acceptance for payment by
Merger Sub of Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer representing at least such
number of Shares as shall satisfy the Minimum Condition (the time of such
acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ "), all of the conditions to the Offer
have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by this Agreement and
applicable Law, waived by Merger Sub) but the number of Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, when taken together with
Shares, if any, then owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries, constitutes less
than 90% of the Shares then outstanding, Merger Sub shall have the right to
provide for a "subsequent offering period" (as contemplated by Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act) without the consent of the Company.

 



3 (e) _Payment_. Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the
satisfaction or permitted waiver of all the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub
shall accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days) after the Offer Expiration Date and in any event in compliance
with Rule 14d-10 and Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding any
of the foregoing contained in this _Section 1.1(e)_, Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right to delay payment for all Shares in order to comply in
whole or in part with applicable Laws; _provided, however_ , that such
extension shall be subject to Merger Subs right to terminate the Offer and
pursue the Merger in connection with a Conversion Event in accordance with
_Section 1.1(f)_ and the parties respective rights to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_. On or prior to the date that Merger Sub
becomes obligated to pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer, Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub the funds necessary to pay for
all Shares that Merger Sub becomes so obligated to pay for pursuant to the
Offer. The Offer Price shall, subject to any required withholding of Taxes, be
net to the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will be tendered to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer. The payment
for Shares accepted for payment pursuant to and subject to the conditions of
the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ".

 

(f) _Continuing Pursuit of the Merger_.

 

(i) If at any then-scheduled Offer Expiration Date occurring on or after the
date that is 45 days after the commencement of the Offer (the " _Offer Walk-
Away Date_ ") any Offer Condition shall not have been satisfied or, to the
extent permitted by this Agreement and applicable Law, waived (other than
Offer Conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied on the Offer
Expiration Date), then, in each case, Merger Sub may, at its sole option,
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and concurrently therewith
shall pursue the Merger as contemplated in _Section 6.1_.

 

(ii) If prior to the Offer Walk-Away Date the Company (x) shall have made a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change (other than with respect to an
Intervening Event) pursuant to _Section 6.3_ or (y) shall have received a
Takeover Proposal (other than from an Excluded Party prior to the end of the
Go-Shop Agreement Cut-Off Date), then Merger Sub may, at its sole option,
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and concurrently therewith
shall pursue the Merger as contemplated in _Section 6.1_.

 

(iii) If prior to the Offer Walk-Away Date, there shall exist a Top-Up
Impediment, then Merger Sub may, at its sole option, irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer and concurrently therewith shall pursue
the Merger as contemplated in _Section 6.1_. Each of the events in clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii) of this _Section 1.1(f)_ that permit Merger Sub to
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and concurrently therewith
pursue the Merger as contemplated in _Section 6.1_ are referred to in this
Agreement as a " _Conversion Event_ ".

 



4 (g) _Termination of the Offer_. The termination of the Offer pursuant to 
_Section 1.1(c)_ or _Section 1.1(f)_ is referred to in this Agreement as the
" _Offer Termination_ ". If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger
Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with  _Section 8.1_,
Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on
behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof in accordance with the terms of the Offer and applicable Law. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Offer Termination shall not give
rise to a right of termination of this Agreement except to the extent
expressly provided for in _Section 8.1_ and that, absent any such termination
of this Agreement, the obligations of the parties hereunder other than those
related to the Offer shall continue to remain in effect, including those
obligations with respect to the Merger.

 

(h) _Adjustments to Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted to the
extent appropriate to reflect the effect of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction
(including any exercise of Rights (as defined in the Rights Plan)) with
respect to the Shares occurring or having a record date on or after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the payment by Merger Sub for the Shares;
_provided_ that this _Section 1.1(h)_ shall not affect or supersede the
provisions of  _Section 6.2_.

(a) _Composition of the Company Board and Committees_. Subject to compliance
with applicable Law, promptly upon the Acceptance Time, Parent, in accordance
with applicable Law, shall be entitled to designate the number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, constituting the Company Board that
equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to the election of directors designated and elected by Parent
pursuant to this _Section 1.3(a)_) and (ii) the percentage that the number of
Shares beneficially owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Shares
purchased pursuant to the Offer) bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding. The Company shall, upon the written request of Parent, promptly
cause Parents designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board at
the Acceptance Time, including, if necessary, by increasing the total number
of Company directorships (including by action of the Company Board to increase
the size of the Company Board), and securing resignations of incumbent
directors. The Company shall also, at the written request of Parent, promptly
cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the number of members,
rounded up to the next whole number, that represents the same percentage as
such individuals represent on the Company Board, on (A) each committee of the
Company Board and (B) each board of directors (or similar body) of each
Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee (or similar body) thereof) at
the Acceptance Time.

 

(b) _Rule 14f-1._ The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to
the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions
necessary to effect the appointment of Parents designees, including mailing
to its stockholders information with respect to the Company and its officers
and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 1.3_ which, unless Parent otherwise elects,
shall be mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply to the
Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with respect
to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 and the Companys obligations under _Section
1.3(a)_ hereof shall be subject to the receipt of such information. The
provisions of this _Section 1.3_ are in addition to and shall not limit any
rights that Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates may have as a
holder or beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of
applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

 



7 (c) _Independent Directors_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at all times prior
to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall be composed of not less than
three (3) Independent Directors, and (i) if the number of Independent
Directors shall ever be fewer than three (3) for any reason (or if immediately
following Offer Closing there are not at least three (3) then-existing
directors of the Company who are willing to serve as Independent Directors),
then the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to designate a
Person to fill each such vacancy and each such designated Person shall be
deemed to be an Independent Director for all purposes of this Agreement, or
(ii) if no Independent Directors remain for any reason, the other directors
shall be required to designate three (3) Persons who are Independent
Directors, and such Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for
all purposes of this Agreement. The Company and the Company Board shall
promptly take all action as may be necessary to comply with their
obligations under this _Section 1.3(c)_.

(e) [Reserved].

 

(f) _Independent Director Approval_. Following the election or appointment of
Parents designees pursuant to  _Section 1.3(a)_ and until the Effective
Time, if Parents designees pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ constitute a
majority of the Company Board, the approval of a majority of the Independent
Directors (or of the sole Independent Director if there shall be only one (1)
Independent Director) shall be required for the Company to authorize (such
authorization, the " _Independent Director Approval_ "): (i) any consent or
action by the Company required under this Agreement, including termination of
this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any amendment of this Agreement or of the
Companys Second Restated Articles of Incorporation (the " _Company Articles
of Incorporation_ ") or Amended and Restated Bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_ "
and, together with the Company Articles of Incorporation, the " _Company
Charter Documents_ "), (iii) any extension of the time for performance of any
obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, (iv) any waiver of
compliance with any covenant of Parent or Merger Sub or any waiver of any
other agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the
Company or (v) any exercise of the Companys rights or remedies under this
Agreement or any action seeking to enforce any obligation of Parent or Merger
Sub under this Agreement. If asked to take any of the actions or to perform
any of the duties set forth in this _Section 1.3(f)_, and with respect to
any transactions where Parent has or reasonably may be deemed to have
interests that are materially different from or in addition to the interests
of the holders of Shares which are not Affiliates of Parent, the Independent
Directors shall have the authority to retain, at the expense of the Company,
the Companys current outside legal counsel, Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, and a
financial advisor, in each case, as reasonably necessary to ensure the
exercise and discharge of their fiduciary and other duties and their
obligations under this Agreement. In addition, following the appointment of
Parents designees pursuant to  _Section 1.3(a)_, the Independent Directors
shall have the authority to institute any action, on behalf of the Company and
any holders of Shares which are not Affiliates of Parent (including at the
request of such holders), to enforce the performance by Merger Sub or Parent
of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



8 SECTION 1.4 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) _Top-Up Option_. Subject to _Section 1.4(b)_ and _Section 1.4(c)_, the
Company grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable and non-transferable option, for
so long as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions
hereof (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), to purchase from the Company such number of
authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option
Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one (1)
share of Company Common Stock more than 90% of the outstanding Shares on a
fully diluted basis after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares. Upon Merger Subs written request, the Company shall as soon as
practicable following receipt of such request (and in no event later than the
Offer Closing) cause its transfer agent to certify in writing to Merger Sub
the number of Shares outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of
the Top-Up Option and after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-
Up Option Shares.

(b) _Exercise of Top-Up Option_. Without the prior written consent of the
Company, the Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub, in whole and not
in part, only once, at any time following the Offer Closing until the tenth
(10th) Business Day thereafter (and if there shall have been commenced a
subsequent offering period as contemplated by  _Section 1.1(d)_, after the
expiration of such subsequent offering period); _provided_ that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option
shall not be exercisable to the extent: (i) the number of Top-Up Option
Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the number of
authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock, (ii) any provision of
applicable Law or any judgment, injunction, order or decree of
any Governmental Authority shall prohibit such exercise, or require any
action, consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, or filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Authority in connection with such
exercise or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such
exercise, if such action, consent, approval, authorization or permit, action,
filing or notification has not theretofore been obtained or made, or (iii) the
conditions set forth in  _Section 7.1(c)_ and _Section 7.1(d)_ are not
satisfied as of the time of the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The
aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Option Shares being purchased
by Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by
multiplying the number of such Top-Up Option Shares then-subject to the Top-Up
Option by the Offer Price. Such purchase price shall be paid by Parent or
Merger Sub, by paying in cash an amount equal to the aggregate par value of
the Top-Up Option Shares and by executing and delivering to the Company a
promissory note (the " _Promissory Note_ ") having a principal amount equal to
the balance of such purchase price. The Promissory Note (A) shall be due on
the first (1st) anniversary of the Top-Up Closing, (B) shall bear simple
interest of 5% per annum, (C) shall be full recourse to Parent and
Merger Sub, (D) may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without
premium or penalty, and (D) shall have no other material terms.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub may elect to pay (or cause to be
paid) all or a portion of the aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up
Option Shares being purchased by Merger Sub in cash.

 



9 (c) _Top-Up Notice; Top-Up Option Closing_. In the event Merger Sub elects,
subject to the provisions of this _Section 1.4_ to exercise the Top-Up
Option, Parent or Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company a written notice
(the " _Top-Up Notice_ ") setting forth (i) its election to so exercise
and purchase the Top-Up Option Shares then-subject to the Top-Up Option, and
(ii) the place (if other than as set forth in _Section 2.2_) and time at
which the simultaneous exercise and purchase of such Top-Up Option Shares by
Merger Sub is to take place. The Top-Up Notice shall also include an
undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Sub that in addition to the provisions
of _Section 1.4(b)_, it shall be a condition to the exercise of the Top-Up
Option that, immediately after such exercise of the Top-Up Option and the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, consummate the Merger in accordance with Section 17-6703 of the
KGCC as contemplated by  _Section 6.1(c)_. At the simultaneous exercise and
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "), Parent or
Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration
required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Option Shares and
consummation of the Merger, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger
Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. The parties hereto
agree to use their reasonable best efforts to cause (A) the exercise of the
Top-Up Option, (B) the issuance and closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares, and (C) the consummation of the Merger in accordance with
Section 17-6703 of the KGCC as contemplated by _Section 6.1(c)_ to occur
simultaneously.

(d) _Exemption from Registration_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the
Top-Up Option Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Securities Act_
") and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption from
registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby
represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub will be, upon the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in
Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the
Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise
of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the
purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

 

(e) _Availability of Common Stock_. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time, the Company shall cause to be reserved and kept available out of its
authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of
Company Common Stock held in its treasury, the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that will be sufficient to permit the exercise in full of the
Top-Up Option pursuant to this _Section 1.4_ in addition to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any
outstanding securities issued by the Company.

 



10 (f) _No Impact on Appraisal Rights_. Any impact on the value of the Shares as
a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares will not be taken into
account in any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 17-6712 of the KGCC as contemplated by _Section 3.3_.

 

SECTION 1.5 _Offer Documents; Schedule 14D-9; Proxy Statement_. Without
limiting any other provision of this Agreement, whenever any party hereto
becomes aware of any event or change which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or the
Proxy Statement, such party shall promptly inform the other parties thereof
and each of the parties shall cooperate in the preparation, filing with the
SEC and (as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws)
dissemination to the Companys stockholders of such amendment or supplement.

ARTICLE III

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

SECTION 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder of any Shares or any shares of capital stock of Merger
Sub:

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.10
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any Shares that
are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any Shares owned by Parent or
Merger Sub, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



12 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each issued and outstanding Share
(other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ and
Dissenting Shares), together with the related Right (as defined in the Rights
Plan) issued pursuant to the Rights Plan, shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of (i) a certificate which represented any such Shares
(each, a " _Certificate_ "), or (ii) any non-certificated Shares represented
by a book-entry (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ "), in each case, that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 3.2(b)_, without
interest. Any Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of any Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and, in the
case of a Certificate, the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by it.

 

SECTION 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to
receive, on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the benefit of
holders of Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of
Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_. Parent shall
deposit such aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent at or prior
to the Effective Time. Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the
Paying Agent shall, pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by
the Paying Agent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the United States of
America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith and credit
of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of
principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the highest
quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Ratings Services or (iv) money market funds investing solely in a combination
of the foregoing. Any such investment shall be for the benefit, and at the
risk, of Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from such
investment shall be for the benefit of Parent; _provided_ that no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to
the holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
and Parent shall promptly provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of
the holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in
the amount of any such losses to the extent necessary to satisfy the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this _Article III_.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event
more than three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Common
Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such
form and shall have such other customary provisions (including customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to
Book-Entry Shares) as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a

 



13  Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or upon receipt of an
agents message in the case of Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without
interest, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends declared in accordance with
_Section 6.2(a)(i)_ with a record date prior to the Effective Time that
remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that are due to such holder, for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person requesting such payment
shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 3.2_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_ , without interest.

 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of Shares upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and at the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares that evidenced ownership of Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of _Section 3.2(e)_, if, at any
time after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article
III_.

 



14 (e) _Termination of Fund_. At any time following the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the
Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which
have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares held by such holders, as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders
at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares or Company
Restricted Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Authority, the withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. If any
withholding obligation may be avoided by such holder providing information or
documentation to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, such information shall be requested prior to any such
withholding.

 

SECTION 3.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor
of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to, and who complies
in all respects with, the provisions of Section 17-6712 of the KGCC, shall not
be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such stockholder
shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 17-6712 of the KGCC (and at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 17-6712 of the KGCC), unless and until such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
rights to appraisal under the KGCC. If any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right, such holders Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such Share, in accordance

 



15  with _Section 3.1(c)_, without any interest thereon, it being understood
that surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing such
Dissenting Shares shall be a prerequisite to the receipt of payment in
respect of any Dissenting Shares represented thereby. The Company shall give
Parent (a) prompt written notice of any written demands for appraisal of any
Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the KGCC and received by the Company relating to
stockholders rights of appraisal, and (b) the right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
the KGCC. Except to the extent required by applicable Law, the Company shall
not offer to make or make any payment with respect to any such demands for
appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demand for appraisal without
the prior written consent of Parent

SECTION 3.4 _Company Restricted Stock_. Each share of restricted stock granted
under any Company Stock Plan (" _Company Restricted Stock_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, if not already
vested, automatically vest in connection with the Merger and, at the Effective
Time, each such share of Company Restricted Stock shall be cancelled,
terminated and converted into the right to receive (a) the Merger
Consideration plus (b) an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends
related to such share of Company Restricted Stock. Such amounts shall be paid
to the holders of Company Restricted Stock as soon as practicable following
the Closing Date, and in any event on the earlier of the first payroll date on
or after the Closing Date or the third (3rd) Business Day after the Closing
Date, through the Companys payroll system. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take the actions necessary to effectuate this  _Section 3.4_.

SECTION 3.5 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article III_
to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction (including any exercise of Rights (as defined in the Rights
Plan)), the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

the Company Disclosure Letter or in (or incorporated by reference in) such
Company SEC

 



16  Documents shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any section of this
_Article IV_ to which the matter relates, to the extent the relevance of such
matter to such section is reasonably apparent from the substance of the

corresponding representation or warranty, other than any matters required to
be disclosed for purposes of _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ ,  _4.5_ , _4.16_ ,

SECTION 4.1 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Kansas and has all requisite
corporate power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it
makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
(as defined below) on the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Material
Adverse Effect_ " shall mean, with respect to the Company, any fact, change,
event, occurrence, condition or development which has, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business, assets,
liabilities, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, _provided_ that none of the
following in and of itself shall be a Material Adverse Effect: (i) changes,
events, occurrences or effects generally affecting the economy or the
financial, debt, credit, capital, banking or securities markets or conditions,
in the United States or elsewhere in the world, including effects on such
segments, economy or markets resulting from or arising out of (1)
any regulatory or political conditions or developments, or (2) any outbreak,
escalation or threat of hostilities, declared or undeclared acts of war,
sabotage or terrorism, or weather or climatic conditions or other force
majeure events; or (ii)(A) changes in Law or in generally accepted accounting
principles or in accounting standards, or changes in general legal, regulatory
or political conditions, (B) the announcement or consummation of this
Agreement or any fact, change, event, occurrence, condition or development
resulting from any actions taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at
the written request of Parent, including the impact thereof on relationships,
contractual or otherwise, with customers, suppliers, distributors,
Franchisees, partners or employees; _provided_ that with respect to references
to Material Adverse Effect in connection with the representations and
warranties set forth in _Sections_ _4.3_ , _4.4_ ,  _4.7(a)(xiii)_ , _4.9(c)_
, _4.12(h)_ , _4.14(b)_ and _4.15(b)_ , the exception set forth in this
subclause (ii)(B) shall not apply, (C) the identity of Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Affiliates as a party to the Transactions, (D) any
action taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries as required by this Agreement
or with Parents written consent or (E) any decline in the market price, or

Company to meet internal projections or forecasts, or projections or forecasts
of any other Person, of revenues, earnings or cash flow for any period ending
on or after the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ that this clause (ii)(E)
shall not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any fact, change,
event, occurrence, condition or development underlying such change in market
price or trading volume or failure has, or would reasonably be expected
to have, or contribute to, a Material Adverse Effect); unless, in the cases
of clauses (i) or (ii), any such fact, change, event, occurrence, condition or
development has a disproportionate effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, when compared to other companies operating in the same
industries in which the Company or its Subsidiaries operate.

 



17 (b) _Section 4.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a true and
complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company, indicating its jurisdiction
of incorporation or formation, and a true and complete list of each other
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity that is
not a Subsidiary but in which the Company, directly or indirectly, holds an
equity interest. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization. Each such Subsidiary is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, each such Subsidiary (except for directors qualifying shares or the
like) are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all
Liens, pledges, security interests and transfer restrictions, except for such
transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under the
Securities Act, and other applicable securities laws, and are validly issued,
fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. No such Subsidiary

commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such
Subsidiary. No Shares are held by any Subsidiary. Except as set forth on
_Section 4.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter_, the Company and
its Subsidiaries do not own, directly or indirectly, any equity, membership
interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest, or other equity or
voting interest in, or any interest convertible into, exercisable or
exchangeable for any of the foregoing in any Person other than the Companys
Subsidiaries, nor are any of them under any current or prospective obligation
to form or participate in, provide funds, make any loan, capital contribution,
guarantee, credit enhancement or other investment in, or assume any liability
or obligation, to any Person (other than routine intercompany cash management

with the system fund administered by International Association of CEC
Entertainment, Inc. in the ordinary course of business and in amounts
consistent with past practice).

or cause the direction of management or policies of each Subsidiary that is
incorporated in Maryland, whether through the ownership of securities or
partnership or other ownership interests, by contract or otherwise, and
immediately after the Closing will continue to solely possess, directly or
indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of management or
policies of each Subsidiary that is not wholly owned by the Company, whether
through the ownership of securities or partnership or other ownership
interests, by contract or otherwise.

to its non-wholly owned Subsidiaries incorporated in Maryland, there are no
voting trusts, proxies or similar agreements, arrangements or commitments to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the
voting of any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of

Company.

 



19 (c) All dividends and distributions (including dividend equivalents) on shares

of the Offer Documents, and any other filings required under, and compliance

ability of Parent or Merger Sub to perform its obligations hereunder or to
consummate the Transactions.

SECTION 5.4 _Information Supplied_. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 4.10_,

in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the respective
times the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9, or any amendments or
supplements thereto, are filed with the SEC or at the time they are first
published, sent or given to stockholders of the Company, or on the
Offer Expiration Date, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Subject to the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section 4.10_, the information supplied by Parent specifically for inclusion
(or incorporation by reference) in the Proxy Statement will not, on the date
it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company (or any amendments or
supplements thereto) and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading.

 

SECTION 5.5 _Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub_. Parent owns beneficially
and of record all of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub. Merger Sub
was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, has engaged
in no other business activities and has conducted its operations only as
contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 5.6 _Capital Resources_. Parent has delivered to the Company true,
correct and complete copies of the debt commitment letter dated as of the
date of this Agreement from Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Deutsche Bank AG
Cayman Islands Branch, Credit Suisse AG, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc.
and UBS AG, Stamford Branch (as the same may be amended or replaced
and including any executed commitment letter (or similar agreement) for
Alternate Financing, in each case, pursuant to _Sections 6.19(b)_ or _6.19(c)_
, as applicable (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") pursuant to which,
and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the lenders party there to
have committed

 



38  to provide or cause to be provided debt financing as described therein (the
" _Debt Financing_ ") and the equity commitment letter dated as of the date of
this Agreement from the Guarantor (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ ," and
together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ ")
pursuant to which the Guarantor has committed, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to invest the amounts as described therein (the " _Equity
Financing_ " and together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). Each
of the Commitment Letters is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
parties thereto in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. None of the Commitment Letters has
been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement, and, as of
the date hereof, the respective commitments contained in the Commitment
Letters have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect.
Assuming (i) the accuracy of the representation and warranties set forth in
_Article IV_ and (ii) the performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of
the covenants contained in this Agreement, in each case such that the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ would be satisfied, the aggregate net
proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letters will be sufficient for Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the Offer and the Merger in accordance with this
Agreement and to pay all fees and expenses payable by them in connection with
the Transactions (such amount, the " _Required Amount_ "). The obligations of
the financing sources to fund the commitments under the Commitment Letters are
not subject to any conditions, side agreements or other arrangements or
understandings (except for fee credit letters and engagement letters and a
fee letter, a copy of which has been provided to the Company with only the
amount of fees, "pricing flex" and other economic terms therein redacted)
other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters. As of the date of this
Agreement, no event has occurred that (with or without notice, lapse of time,
or both) would constitute a breach or default under the Commitment Letters by
Parent or Merger Sub. Parent has no knowledge of any facts or circumstances
that, assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_, would be reasonably likely to result in (a) the conditions
precedent set forth in the Commitment Letters not being satisfied or (b) the
funding contemplated in the Commitment Letters not being made available to
Parent in order to consummate the Transactions at the Closing. Parent has
fully paid any and all commitment and other fees that have been incurred and
are due and payable on or prior to the date hereof in connection with the
Commitment Letters and has otherwise satisfied all of the other terms and
conditions required to be satisfied pursuant to the terms of the Commitment
Letters on or prior to the date hereof, and Parent will pay when due all
other commitment fees arising under the Commitment Letters as and when they
become payable.

Agreement, the Guarantor has delivered to the Company the Limited Guarantee,
dated as of the date hereof, in favor of the Company, in the form set forth in
_Exhibit A_ hereto. The Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect (subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception) and no event has occurred which, with
or without the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor
under the Limited Guarantee.

 



39 SECTION 5.8 _Brokers and Other Advisors_. Except for Goldman, Sachs and Co.,
the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, no broker, investment
banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent
or any of its Affiliates.

SECTION 5.9 _Ownership of Shares_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub owns any
Shares, beneficially, of record or otherwise, as of the date hereof.

SECTION 5.10  _Certain Arrangements_. There are no Contracts between Parent,
Merger Sub or the Guarantor, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys
management or directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof that relate
in any way to the Company or the Transactions.

Company in _Article IV_ of this Agreement (as modified by the Company
Disclosure Letter and the Company SEC Documents), Parent and Merger Sub

its Subsidiaries has any authority, express or implied, to make any
representations, warranties or agreements not specifically set forth in this
Agreement and subject to the limited remedies herein provided.

such other representations or warranties that may have been made by any
Person, and acknowledge and agree that the Company has specifically
disclaimed and does hereby specifically disclaim any such other representation

of the Companys receipt thereof. The Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from

on a current basis (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) of the
status of any discussions or negotiations and of any modifications to
such inquiries, proposals or offers, including any change in the Companys
intentions as previously stated.

(h) Notwithstanding _Section 6.3(g)_, the Company Board may, at any time
before the earlier of (i) the Acceptance Time or (ii) the adoption of this

financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with
Parent and its Affiliates in good faith (to the extent Parent and its
Affiliates also seek to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and

Proposal that is deemed to constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 

(iii) Parent does not make, within five (5) Business Days (or, with respect to
a Superior Proposal from a Pre-Existing Qualified Bidder during the Go-Shop
Period or an Excluded Party prior to the Go-Shop Agreement Cut-Off Date, two
(2) Business Days) after the receipt of such notice (it being understood and
agreed that any material change to the financial or other terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal shall require an additional notice to
Parent and an additional three (3) Business Day period) (or, with respect to a
Superior Proposal from a Pre-Existing Qualified Bidder during the Go-Shop
Period or an Excluded Party prior to the Go-Shop Agreement Cut-Off Date, an
additional two (2) Business Days) (any such notice period being the " _Notice
Period_ "), a proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor, causes the Takeover Proposal that
constituted a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this clause (h), and any purported termination pursuant to this
clause (h) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless (A) at or
concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Company Termination

any time before the earlier of (i) the Acceptance Time or (ii) the adoption
of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders (x) in response to the receipt
of a bona fide written Takeover Proposal, if the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its advisors) that such bona fide written
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (after consultation with
outside legal counsel), that it is required to withdraw, modify or amend the
Company Board Recommendation in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, or (y) if, other than in
connection with a Takeover Proposal, an event, fact, circumstance, development
or occurrence (an " _Intervening Event_ ") that affects the business assets
or operations of the Company that is unknown (and is not reasonably
foreseeable) to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement becomes
known to the Company Board prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval and the Company Board has concluded in good faith,
following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that it would be
required to withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation in
order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law,

 



50  then, in each case, the Company Board may withdraw, modify or amend the
Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent; _provided_ that
the Company Board may not withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent pursuant to the foregoing if any
such Superior Proposal resulted from a breach by the Company of this _Section
6.3_. The Company agrees that any violation of this  _Section 6.3_ by any

reasonably determines in good faith during the one (1) Business Day period
commencing upon the expiration of the Go Shop Period, after consultation with
the Companys financial and legal advisors, constitutes or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a

Board thereunder); _provided_ that any such disclosure (other than a "stop,
look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed a

Without limiting any other provision hereof, Parent and the Company shall
each use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any decree, order or judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions, on or before the Walk-
Away Date, including by defending through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in any court by any Person, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the
consummation of the Transactions to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and
in any event no later than the Walk-Away Date).

 



53 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates shall be required to (and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall), (i) sell, license,
divest or dispose of or hold separate any entities, assets, Intellectual
Property or businesses of any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
terminate, amend or assign existing relationships or contractual rights and
obligations, of any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) change or
modify any course of conduct regarding future operations, of any Affiliate of
Parent or Merger Sub or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) otherwise take actions that would limit its
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of
their respective businesses, assets or rights or interests therein or (v)
commit to take any such actions in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or
(iv). For the avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not require the Company or its
Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required
to, take any action with respect to any orders, decisions, judgments, writs,
injunctions, decrees, awards or other determination of any Governmental
Authority or any applicable Law which would bind the Company or its
Subsidiaries irrespective of whether the Merger occurs.

(f) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, the
Company shall deliver all notices required pursuant to any Material
Contracts, Franchise Agreements or Company Leases as a result of the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and/or the consummation
of the Transactions. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, waive any notice periods required pursuant to any intercompany agreements
as a result of the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and/or and the consummation of the Transactions that would, without such
waiver, extend beyond the Walk-Away Date. Parent and the Company shall
cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of all
such filings and notifications, including by providing copies of all relevant
documents to the non-filing party and its advisors before filing.

SECTION 6.5 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, except as set
forth in _Section 6.3_, neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause
the publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the
extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) with
respect to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions without the
prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any applicable
listing agreement with a national securities exchange or the New York Stock
Exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to
make such release (in which case such party shall not issue or cause the
publication of such press release or other public announcement without prior
consultation with the other party); _provided, however_ , that subject to
_Section 6.3_, the Company need not consult with Parent or Merger Sub in
connection with any press release or public statement to be issued or made in
connection with any Takeover Proposal or any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change; and _provided, further_ , that the Company, Parent or Merger Sub may
make any public statement in response to specific questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analyst conference calls, so long as such statement is substantially similar
to previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made
jointly by Parent and the Company (or individually, if approved by the other
party).

 



54 SECTION 6.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall afford to
Parent and Parents representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to the Companys officers, employees, properties, books, Contracts and
records and the Company shall furnish reasonably promptly to Parent such
other information concerning its business and properties as Parent may
reasonably request (provided that Parent and its representatives shall conduct
any such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the business or operations of the Company); _provided, however_ , that the
Company shall not be obligated to provide such access or information if (a)
the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would
violate applicable Law or a Contract or an obligation of confidentiality owing
to a third party so long as the Company shall have used reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such access,
jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client privilege, or expose the
Company to risk of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal
information or (b) such information relates to or includes the evaluation,
deliberations or minutes of the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
related to the Transactions or any materials provided to the Company Board (or
any committee thereof) in connection therewith. Until the Effective Time, the
information provided will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of the date of this Agreement, by and between the Company
and Apollo Management VIII, L.P. (as it may be amended from time to time, the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its representatives not to, use
such information for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
Transactions. No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this
_Section 6.6_ will modify any of the representations and warranties of the
Company herein. The Company hereby releases Apollo Management VIII, L.P. from
all of its obligations under the confidentiality agreement between the
Company and Apollo Management VIII, L.P., dated as of October 23, 2013 (as
amended, the " _Existing Confidentiality Agreement_ ")), and the Company
agrees that Apollo Management VIII, L.P. shall have no further liability under
the Existing Confidentiality Agreement.

SECTION 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters; Further Action; Consents_.

 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of (i) any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter
of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent
could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii)
any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to
such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Transactions (each, a " _Transaction Claim_ ") or (iii) any change, condition
or event (including any renewal, termination, or amendment of, or any
proposed modification to, any Material Contract, Franchise Agreement or
Company Lease) (A) that to such partys knowledge renders or would reasonably
be expected to render any representation or warranty of such party set forth
in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (B)
that results or would reasonably be expected to result in any failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
(including any of the Offer Conditions or any condition set forth in _Article
VII_ ) to be complied with or satisfied hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such notification shall affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the
obligations of, the parties hereunder.

 



55 (b) The Company shall promptly provide copies to Parent of all proceedings and
correspondence relating to any Transaction Claim. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate with the Company regarding the defense
or settlement of any Transaction Claim, and shall give due consideration to
Parents advice with respect to such Transaction Claim. Without the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not settle any Transaction Claim.

SECTION 6.8  _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Company and the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless
each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the
Effective Time was, a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or
of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively,
the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses,
damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative),
whenever asserted, based on or arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the
fact that an Indemnitee was a director, officer, or employee of the Company or
such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees
capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or such
Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary
(including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary as a director, officer, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of
another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case under (A)
or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any claim,
suit, action, proceeding or investigation relating in whole or in part to the
Transactions), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, and (ii)
assume all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees
in respect of indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in (x) the
Company Charter Documents and the organizational documents of such
Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (y) the indemnification agreements
listed on _Section 6.8(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter_, which shall
survive the Transactions and continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and
after the Effective Time, shall cause the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to
the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of
this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not,
for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company and the Surviving
Corporation to, advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) of any Indemnitee under this  _Section 6.8_ (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in
this _Section 6.8_) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
under applicable Law that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified.

 



56 (b) In the event of any litigation, claim or proceeding relating to any acts
or omissions covered under this _Section 6.8_ (each, a " _Claim_ "), (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnitee in the defense of
any such Claim and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim
pending or threatened in writing to which an Indemnitee is a party (and in
respect of which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnitee
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability arising out of
such Legal Action or the Indemnified Party otherwise consents.

 

(c) For the six-year (6) period commencing immediately after the Effective
Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently (and any
additional persons who prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms and
scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, substantially similar to
those of such policy in effect on the date hereof (or Parent may substitute
therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time); _provided,
however_ , that, if the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance
shall exceed 300% of the current aggregate annual premium, then Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided a policy for the applicable individuals with
the best coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium of 300% of
the current aggregate annual premium; _provided_ that any such replacement or
substitution of insurance policies shall not result in gaps in coverage. The
Company may, and, if requested by Parent, shall purchase, prior to the
Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions
providing substantially similar benefits as the current policies of directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or
before the Effective Time, covering without limitation the Transactions;
_provided_ that the Company shall not pay in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of such
"tail" policy. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained
in full force and effect, for its full term, and no party shall have any
further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder.

(d) The provisions of this  _Section 6.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have under applicable Law, the Company Charter Documents, by contract or
otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 6.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.8_
applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this _Section 6.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.8_).

 



57 (e) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set
forth in this _Section 6.8_.

 

SECTION 6.9 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as provided in _Sections 8.3_ , _8.4_
and _8.5_ , all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or
expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated.

 

SECTION 6.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause
dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director or officer
of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

SECTION 6.11 _Employee Matters_. Parent shall, for a period of one (1) year
immediately following the Closing Date (or, if earlier, the date of
termination of the applicable Company Employee (defined below)), cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide salaried employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Company Employees_ ") with (a) if
employed as a salaried, exempt employee, the level of base salary that, on an
individual-by-individual basis, is no less favorable to the level of base
salary in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date and (b) employee
benefit plans and programs (excluding for purposes of this clause (b) any
equity compensation grants) that are substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to the employee benefit plans and programs provided by the Company
and its Subsidiaries to Company Employees prior to the Closing Date (excluding
for purposes of this clause (b) any equity compensation grants). Parent or one
of its Affiliates shall recognize the service of Company Employees with the
Company prior to the Closing Date as service with Parent and its Affiliates in
connection with any 401(k) savings plan and welfare benefit plans and policies
(including vacations and holiday policies) maintained by Parent or one of its
Affiliates which is made available following the Closing Date by Parent or one
of its Affiliates for purposes of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility and
benefit entitlement (but excluding benefit accruals);  _provided_ that the
foregoing service credit shall not apply with respect to any defined benefit
plan or to the extent its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) waive, or
cause its insurance carriers to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing and
at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to Company Employees under any welfare benefit plan
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which is made available to Company
Employees following the Closing Date by Parent or one of its Affiliates if
such limitations and conditions were waived with respect to such Company
Employees under the Company Plans, and (y) provide credit solely for purposes
of the plan year in which the Closing occurs to Company Employees for any co-
payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses

 



58  paid by such employees under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the portion of the
relevant plan year including the Closing Date. Without limiting the
generality of _Section 9.6_, the provisions of this _Section 6.11_ are
solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no Company
Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded
for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no
provision of this _Section 6.11_ shall create such rights in any such
individuals. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall: (i) guarantee
employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates to terminate the
employment of any Company Employee at any time and for any reason; (ii)
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to continue any Company Plan or other employee benefit plans,
programs or Contracts or prevent the amendment, modification or termination
thereof following the Closing; or (iii) amend any Company Plans or other
employee benefit plans, programs or Contracts.

SECTION 6.12 _Company Disclosure Letter_. The Company may, at its option,
include in the Company Disclosure Letter items that are not material in order
to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any references to dollar
amounts, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or representation that
such items are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define
further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement. Any matter
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be disclosed
with respect to any section of _Article IV_ to which the matter relates, to
the extent the relevance of such matter to such a section of the Company
Disclosure Letter is reasonably apparent from the substance of the disclosure
made as to matters and items which are the subject of the corresponding
representation or warranty, other than any matters required to be disclosed
for purposes of _Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.5_ , _4.16_ , _4.17_ , _4.26_ and
_4.27_ which matters shall only be disclosed by specific disclosure in the
respective corresponding section of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

SECTION 6.13 _Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and
rules and policies of the New York Stock Exchange to cause the delisting of
the Company Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company
Common Stock at the completion of the Offer.

 

SECTION 6.14 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company shall not take any action which
would cause any Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall become
applicable to the Transactions after the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to take such actions to ensure that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute or regulation on the Transactions.

 



59 SECTION 6.15 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any
partys rights or obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, _Section 6.2_), the parties understand and agree that: (a)
nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior
to the Effective Time, and (b) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations.

SECTION 6.16 _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any real
estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly
or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall be borne
by the Surviving Corporation or Parent and expressly shall not be a liability
of stockholders of the Company.

SECTION 6.17 _Rule 14d-10_. Prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Company
(acting through the Company Board or its compensation committee) will take all
such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 14d-10(d) under
the Exchange Act any employment compensation, severance or employee benefit
arrangements that have been or will be entered into after the date of this
Agreement by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates with
current or future directors, officers or employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and to ensure that any such arrangements fall within the safe
harbor provisions of such rule.

SECTION 6.18 _Obligations of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation_.
Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement.

 

SECTION 6.19 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts (taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) to arrange and
consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letters at or prior to the Closing including by (i) maintaining in
effect the Commitment Letters and negotiating and entering into the definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Definitive Financing
Agreements_ ") on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter; (ii) satisfying (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, seeking the waiver
of) on a timely basis all terms, covenants and conditions forth in the
Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing Agreements applicable to
Parent and Merger Sub that are within their control; and (iii) upon
satisfaction of all of the conditions precedent under _Section 7.1_ and
_Section 7.2_ (except those that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the
Closing, provided that such conditions would be so satisfied as of such date),
consummating or causing the consummation of the Financing including, if
necessary, by enforcing their rights under the Commitment Letters and the
Definitive Financing Agreements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing contained in this  _Section 6.19_ shall require, and
in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be
deemed or construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) seek the
Equity Financing from any source other than the Guarantor counterparty to, or
in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter,
or (ii) pay any material fees in excess of those contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter.

 



60 (b) Upon request of the Company, Parent shall apprise the Company of material
developments relating to the Financing and shall give the Company prompt
notice of any material adverse change with respect to such Financing. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in
any event within two (2) Business Days, if at any time prior to the Closing
Date (i) any Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing Agreement, as
applicable, shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii) any financing
source that is a party to any Commitment Letter and is also party to any
Definitive Financing Agreement notifies Parent that such source no longer
intends to provide financing to Parent on the terms set forth therein, or
(iii) for any reason Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will be
able to obtain all of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters on
the terms described therein. Parent shall not amend, alter or replace, or
agree to amend, alter or replace, any Commitment Letter in any manner that
would (i) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing, or (ii) reduce
the amount of cash proceeds from the Financing available to fund the
Required Amount, in each case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of Parent to consummate
the Transactions without the prior written consent of the Company (it being
understood and agreed that Parent and Merge Sub may amend the Debt Commitment
Letter solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents
or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement.

 

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, or if the Debt
Commitment Letter shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially
adverse to Parent for any reason, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms, taken as a whole, not materially less favorable
to Parent and Merger Sub as those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
(after taking into account any "flex" provisions included in the related fee
letter) and in an amount sufficient to fund the Required Amount (the "
_Alternate Financing_ ") and to obtain, and, if obtained, will provide the
Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for at least
the same amount of financing as such Debt Commitment Letter as originally
issued, to the extent needed to fund the Required Amount, and on terms and
conditions, taken as a whole, not materially less favorable to Parent or
Merger Sub than those included in the Debt Commitment Letter on the date
hereof (after taking into account any "flex" provisions included in the
related fee letter) (the " _Alternate Debt Commitment Letter_ "). In the event
any Alternate Financing is obtained and an Alternate Debt Commitment Letter
is entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.19(c)_, (i) any reference
in this Agreement to "Debt Financing" shall mean the debt financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause
(ii) below, and (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt Commitment
Letter" (or defined terms that use such phrase) shall be deemed to include the
Debt Commitment Letter to the extent not superseded by an Alternate Debt
Commitment Letter, at the time in question and any Alternate Debt Commitment
Letter to the extent then in effect.

 



61 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub may enter discussions regarding, and may enter into arrangements
and agreements relating to the Financing to add other equity providers, so
long as in respect of any such arrangements and agreements, the following
conditions are met: (i) the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing is not
reduced; (ii) the arrangements and agreements, in the aggregate, would not be
reasonably likely to delay or prevent the Closing; and (iii) the arrangements
and agreements would not diminish or release the pre-closing obligations of
the parties to the Equity Commitment Letter, adversely affect the rights of
Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Equity Commitment Letter, or otherwise constitute a waiver or reduction of
Parents or Merger Subs rights under the Equity Commitment Letter.

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective
Representatives to provide to Parent and Merger Sub such cooperation in
connection with the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, including:

(i) assisting in preparation for and participation upon reasonable advance
notice in a reasonable number of meetings and calls, drafting sessions,
rating agency presentations, road shows and due diligence sessions (including
accounting due diligence sessions) and sessions with prospective lenders,
investors and ratings agencies, and assisting Parent in obtaining ratings as
contemplated by the Debt Financing;

(ii) assisting Parent and the Debt Financing sources in the preparation of
(A) offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information
memoranda, prospectuses and similar marketing documents for any of the Debt
Financing, including the execution and delivery of customary representation
letters in connection with bank information memoranda authorizing the
distribution of information to prospective lenders and identifying any portion
of such information that constitutes material, nonpublic information regarding
the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective securities; and (B)
customary materials for rating agency presentations; it being understood and
agreed that such documents, memoranda, prospectuses and materials shall
contain disclosure and pro forma financial statements reflecting the
Surviving Corporation as obligor;

(iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable (A) furnishing Parents financing
sources (including the Debt Financing sources) and their respective
Representatives with the Required Information and (B) informing Parent if the
chief executive officer, chief financial officer, treasurer or controller of
the Company or any member of the Company Board shall have actual knowledge of
any facts as a result of which a restatement of any financial statements for
such financial statements to comply with GAAP is probable;

 

(iv) providing appropriate representations in connection with the preparation
of financial statements and other financial data of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and requesting accountants consents in connection with the use
of the Companys financial statements in offering documents, prospectuses,
Current Reports on Form 8-K and other documents to be filed with the SEC, if
necessary;

 



62 (v) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in connection with
the preparation of pro forma financial information and financial statements
to the extent required by SEC rules and regulations or necessary or reasonably
required by Parents financing sources (including the Debt Financing sources)
to be included in any offering documents; _provided_ that neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be responsible in any
manner for information relating to the proposed debt and equity capitalization
that is required for such pro forma financial information;

(vi) using reasonable best efforts to provide monthly financial statements in
the form currently prepared by the Company as soon as reasonably practicable
after the same become available after the end of each month prior to the
Closing;

 

(vii) executing and delivering as of (but not before) the Closing any pledge
and security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates, or documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent (including
a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with respect to
solvency matters in the form set forth as an annex to the Debt Commitment
Letter) and otherwise facilitating the pledging of collateral (including (x)
cooperation in connection with the pay-off of existing Indebtedness to the
extent contemplated by this Agreement and the release of related Liens
and termination of security interests (it being understood and agreed that no
such certificate or document shall become effective until the Effective Time),
(y) cooperation in connection with Parents efforts to obtain
environmental assessments and title insurance) and (z) using reasonable best
efforts to procure customary ( _e.g._ , local counsel) legal opinions;

 

(viii) upon the reasonable request of Parent and to the extent the same become

result of the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or
material breach of this Agreement by, the Company or its Subsidiaries or, in
each case, their respective Representatives. In addition, Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable

Company to take such action or issues an injunction mandating such action.

by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other

extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

SECTION 9.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written

Merger Sub shall be permitted, without the Companys consent, to assign any
of their respective rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to
any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries or to any financing source for security
purposes, and the enforcement of all rights and remedies that Parent has
against the Company, but such assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger
Sub of any obligation or liability hereunder. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section
9.4_ shall be null and void.

the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The parties hereto have
voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and obligations
respecting the Transactions exclusively in contract pursuant to the express
terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the parties hereto expressly
disclaim that they are owed any duties or entitled to any remedies not
expressly set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, the parties each hereby
acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of
sophisticated parties derived from arms-length negotiations, and all parties
to this Agreement specifically acknowledge that no party has any special
relationship with another party that would justify any expectation beyond that
of an ordinary purchaser and an ordinary seller in an arms-length
transaction. 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns any right or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement other than (i) after the Effective Time,
the rights of the holders of Company Common Stock or Company Restricted
Stock to receive the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of _Articles I_ and _III_ , as applicable; (ii) the rights of
Indemnitees as provided in _Section 6.8,_ (iii) the rights of Non-
Party Affiliates as provided in _Section 9.12_ and (iv) as to the financing
sources under the Debt Financing, the provisions of _Section 8.2_, _Section
8.4_, _Section 8.6_, this _Section 9.6_ and  _Section 9.7_ (it being
understood that such provisions may not be amended in a manner adverse to such
financing sources in any material respect without their prior written
consent). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is
explicitly agreed that, as set forth in Section 6 of the Equity Commitment
Letter, the Company shall be a third party beneficiary of the Equity
Commitment Letter, solely to the extent that the Company is awarded, in
accordance with _Section 9.8_, specific performance of Parents obligation
to cause the Equity Financing to be funded.

 

SECTION 9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement, together with _Annex A_ hereto, the Limited Guarantee, the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement and any other
document, certificate or instrument delivered pursuant hereto (together, the "
_Related Documents_ "), and all claims or causes of action (whether in
contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, the Related Documents or the negotiation, execution, termination,
validity, interpretation, construction, enforcement, performance or
nonperformance of this Agreement or the Related Documents or otherwise arising
from the relationship between the parties (including, without limitation, any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or the
Related Documents or as an inducement to enter into

 



74  this Agreement or the Related Documents) (all such claims or causes of
action, a " _Cause of Action_ ") shall be governed by the internal laws of the
State of Delaware (including its laws regarding statutes of limitations),
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rules
(whether of the State of Delaware or otherwise) that would cause the
application of Laws of any other jurisdiction. 

(b) Each party to this Agreement (i) irrevocably and unconditionally submits
to the personal jurisdiction of the federal courts of the United States of
America located in the State of Delaware and the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (iii) agrees that any actions or proceedings (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, tort or otherwise) arising in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Financing or
the Limited Guarantee shall be brought, tried and determined only in the
Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over the particular matter, any state or
federal court within the State of Delaware), (iv) waives any claim of
improper venue or any claim that those courts are an inconvenient forum and
(v) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. The parties to this Agreement agree that mailing of process
or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner
provided in _Section 9.9_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by
applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the Parties
agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in Law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the
financing sources for the Financing and their respective current, former or
future directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders,
members, managers, controlling persons, Affiliates, employees or
Representatives in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof).

 

(d) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES
AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY
HAS CONSIDERED AND UNDERSTANDS THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) SUCH PARTY
MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.7_.

 



75 SECTION 9.8 _Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages. It
is accordingly agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Article VIII_ , and subject to _Section 9.8(b)_ and
_Section 9.8(c)_, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub of any of their respective covenants or
obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company (on its own behalf and
on behalf of any third party beneficiaries designated in _Section 9.6_), on
the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement or the Limited Guarantee by the other (as
applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other under this
Agreement and the Limited Guarantee.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to
enforce specifically Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the
Offer or the Merger, to pay the Offer Price or Merger Consideration or to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the
Equity Commitment Letter) (each, a " _Consummation Event_ ") unless:

 

(i) with respect to the Offer and payment of the Offer Price and the Equity
Financing related thereto, all of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or
waived as of the expiration of the Offer;

(ii) with respect to the Merger, the payment of the Merger Consideration and
the Equity Financing related thereto, all the conditions set forth in _Section
7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being
satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived;

(iii) Parent (either directly or through its Subsidiaries) has received the
Debt Financing (or any Alternate Debt Financing) and/or Parent (either
directly or through its Subsidiaries) has entered into Definitive Financing
Agreements, collectively in an amount at least equal to the Required Amount,
which amount will be available to Parent (either directly or through its
Subsidiaries) at the Offer Closing, subject only to consummation of the Offer
Closing and the Closing; and

 

(iv) with respect to any funding of the Equity Financing to occur at the
Closing, the Company has irrevocably and unconditionally confirmed that if
specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing
are funded, then the Closing will occur (and the Company has not revoked such
confirmation).

 



76 (c) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary, for the avoidance of doubt,
while the Company may concurrently seek specific performance or other
equitable relief in order to effect a Consummation Event and payment of the
Parent Termination Fee under _Section 8.4_, under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance or other equitable relief in order to effect a Consummation Event
and payment of any monetary damages, including all or any portion of the
Parent Termination Fee.

 

(d) Each party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other
parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement when
expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction. The parties hereto further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this _Section 9.8_, a party shall not in any respect waive
its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party
under this Agreement or the Limited Guarantee (including monetary damages) in
the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.8_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing set forth in this
_Section 9.8_ shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for
(or limit any partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific
performance under this _Section 9.8_ prior or as a condition to exercising
any termination right under _Article VIII_ , nor shall the commencement of any
Legal Action or legal proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.8_ or anything
set forth in this _Section 9.8_ restrict or limit any partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_ , or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement or the Limited Guarantee that
may be available then or thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt and subject
only to the possible entitlement to specific performance as set forth in this
_Section 9.8_, in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub, their respective
Associated Parties or any Associated Party of such Associated Parties have
any liability under or in respect of this Agreement or the transactions
related hereto in excess of an aggregate amount equal to the Parent
Termination Fee.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as and
to the extent expressly permitted by this  _Section 9.8_, the parties
acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or
any remedy to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and that the Companys sole and exclusive remedies with respect to any such
breach shall be the remedies set forth in _Section 8.4_.

 

SECTION 9.9 _Notices_. Any notice or other communication required or permitted
to be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and

fully-diluted basis (the " _Minimum Condition_ "), (ii) any applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated prior to
the expiration of the Offer, (iii) Parent (either directly or through its
Subsidiaries) shall not have entered into Definitive Financing Agreements,
collectively in an amount at least equal to the Required Amount, which amount
will be available to Parent (either directly or through its Subsidiaries) at
the Offer Closing, subject only to consummation of the Offer Closing and the
Closing or (iv) at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and prior
to the expiration of the Offer, any of the following conditions shall exist
and be continuing as of the expiration of the Offer:

 

(a) (i) There shall be pending any Legal Action by any state or federal
Governmental Authority that seeks, directly or indirectly, to challenge or
make illegal or otherwise enjoin, prohibit, prevent, restrain or materially
delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions; or (ii) there shall be in effect any Restraint, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, directly or indirectly, result in any of the consequences
referred to in clause (i) above;

 

(b) (i) Any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
_Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.3(a)_ ,  _4.3(d)_ , _4.3(e)_ , _4.6(c)_ , _4.17_
and _4.26_ shall not be true and correct in all respects in each case as of
the date of the Agreement and as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of
the Closing Date (or, if given as of a specific date, at and as of such
date); (ii) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained
in _4.3(b)_ , _4.3(c)_ , _4.16_ and _4.27_ shall not be true and correct in
all material respects in each case as of the date of the Agreement and as of
the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date (except to the
extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date, in
which case they shall be true and correct as of such earlier date); or (iii)
any of the remaining representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in the Agreement, disregarding all qualifications and exceptions contained
therein relating to materiality or Material Adverse Effect, shall not be true
as of the expiration of the Offer as though made on and as of such time
(except to the extent such representations and

 



Annex A-1  warranties speak as of an earlier date, as of such earlier date), _provided_
, _however_ , that for purposes of this clause (iii), such representations and
warranties shall be deemed to be true and correct in all respects unless the
failure or failures of such representations and warranties to be so true and
correct have had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;

 

(c) The Company shall not have performed or complied in all material respects
with its obligations, agreements or covenants required to be performed or
complied with under the Agreement at or prior to the expiration of the Offer,
and such breach or failure has not been cured at or prior to the expiration of
the Offer;

 

(d) Since the date of the Agreement, there has been any event, change,
development, circumstance, occurrence, effect, condition or state of facts
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that has
or could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect;

 

(e) There shall have been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;

 

(f) In the event that the exercise of the Top-Up Option is necessary to ensure
that Parent or Merger Sub owns at least ninety percent (90%) of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis
immediately after the Offer Closing, (i) there shall exist under applicable
Law any restriction or legal impediment on Merger Subs ability and right
to exercise the Top-Up Option (the " _Top-Up Impediment_ ") or (ii) the
shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option
together with the shares validly tendered in the Offer and not
properly withdrawn are insufficient for Merger Sub to reach at least ninety
percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted

(g) The Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms or
the Offer shall have been terminated in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement.

behalf of the Company by the chief executive officer of the Company, dated as
of the Offer Closing, certifying that none of the conditions in paragraphs
(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of this _Annex A_ shall have occurred and be
continuing. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a
limitation of, the rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or
modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.

 

(i) The Marketing Period shall not have been completed.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and applicable Law,
may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and
from time to time (other than the Minimum Condition). The failure by Parent or
Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not
be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

 

If the Offer is terminated, all tendered Shares not theretofore accepted for
payment shall forthwith be returned to the tendering stockholders.

Corporation and its creditors or any class of them or between this Corporation
and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of competent jurisdiction
within the state of Kansas, on the application in a summary way of this
Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of
any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under the provisions
of K.S.A. 17-6808 and 17-6901, and amendments thereto, may order a meeting of
the creditors or class of creditors, or of the stockholders or class of
stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such
manner as the court directs. If a majority in number representing 3⁄4 in
value of the creditors or class of creditors, or of the stockholders or class
of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be, agree to
any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of this Corporation
as consequence of such compromise or arrangement and the reorganization, if
sanctioned by the court to which the application has been made, shall be
binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, or on all the
stockholders or class of stockholders, of this Corporation, as the case may
be, and also on this Corporation.

 

Ninth.

A.  _Actions Involving Directors and Officers_. The Corporation shall
indemnify each person who at any time is serving or has served as a director
or officer of the Corporation against any claim, liability or expense incurred
as a result of such service, or as a result of any other service on behalf of
the Corporation, to the maximum extent permitted by law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person
who was or is a party (other than a party plaintiff suing on his own behalf
or in the right of the Corporation), or is threatened to be made a party, to
any threatened, pending or completed

 



Annex B-3  action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (including, but not limited to, an action by or in the right of
the Corporation) by reason of such service against expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding.

 

B. _Actions Involving Employees or Agents_.

 

1\. The Corporation may, if it deems appropriate and as may be permitted by
this Article, indemnify any person who at any time is serving or has served
as an employee or agent of the Corporation against any claim, liability or
expense incurred as a result of such service or as a result of any other
service on behalf of the Corporation, or service at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, to the maximum extent
permitted by law or to such lesser extent as the Corporation, in its
discretion, may deem appropriate. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Corporation may indemnify any such person who was or is a party
(other than a party plaintiff suing on his own behalf or in the right of the
Corporation), or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (including, but not limited to, an action by
or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of such services against
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such
action, suit or proceeding.

 

2\. To the extent that a present or former director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in
defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections A or B(1) of
this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person
shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually
and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the action, suit or
proceeding.

C. _Determination of Right to Indemnification in Certain Circumstances_. Any
indemnification required under Section A or Section B(2) of this Article or
authorized by the Corporation under Section B(1) of this Article, unless
ordered by a court, shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in
the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or
former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances
because he has met the applicable standard of conduct required by K.S.A.
17-6305. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a
director or officer at the time of such determination: (1) By a majority vote
of the directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding,
even though less than a quorum, (2) by a committee of such directors
designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum,
(3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders.

D. _Advance Payment of Expenses_. Expenses, including attorney fees, incurred
by a person who is or was a director or officer in defending a civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be
paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action,
suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
director or officer to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that
the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation
as authorized in this section. 

 



Annex B-4 E. _Not Exclusive_. The indemnification provided by this Article shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification
may be entitled under the bylaws of the Corporation or any statute, agreement,
vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office.

F. _Indemnification Agreements Authorized_. Without limiting the other
provisions of this Article, the Corporation is authorized from time to time,
without further action by the shareholders of the Corporation, to enter into
agreements with any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation providing such rights of indemnification as the Corporation may
deem appropriate, up to the maximum extent permitted by law. Any such
agreement entered into by the Corporation with a director may be authorized by
the other directors, and such authorization shall not be invalid on the basis
that similar agreements may have been or may thereafter be entered into with
such other directors.

 

G. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf
of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was otherwise serving on behalf or at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or arising out of his
status as such, whether or not the Corporation is obliged to or would have the
power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this
Article; provided, that the obtaining of any such insurance shall not give
rise to any right to indemnification for any director, officer, employee or
agent except as otherwise specified herein, in the bylaws of the Corporation,
or by separate agreement with the Corporation.

 

H. _Survival_. Any indemnification rights and rights to the advancement of
expenses provided pursuant to this Article shall continue as to a person who
has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Notwithstanding any other provision in these Articles of
Incorporation, indemnification rights and rights to the advancement of
expenses arising under or granted pursuant to this Article shall survive
amendment or repeal of this Article with respect to any acts or omissions
occurring prior to the effective time of such amendment or repeal and persons
to whom such rights are given shall be entitled to rely upon such rights with
respect to such acts or omissions as a binding contract with the Corporation.

 

Tenth. The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in these Articles of Incorporation in the manner now
or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon
stockholders, directors and officers herein are granted subject to this
reservation.

 _Limited Guarantee_

 

[Attached]

 



Exhibit A-1 Exhibit A

 

 _LIMITED GUARANTEE_

 

Limited Guarantee, dated as of January 15, 2014 (this " _Limited Guarantee_
"), by each of the parties listed on _Exhibit A_ hereto (each, a "
_Guarantor_ " and collectively, the " _Guarantors_ "), in favor of CEC
Entertainment, Inc., a Kansas corporation (the " _Guaranteed Party_ ").
Reference is hereby made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the
date hereof, by and among the Guaranteed Party, Queso Holdings Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Q Merger Sub Inc., a Kansas
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ") (as
the same may be amended or modified from time to time, the " _Merger
Agreement_ "). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. 

1\. _Limited Guarantee_. Each Guarantor hereby guarantees, severally and not
jointly, and not jointly and severally, to the Guaranteed Party, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the due and punctual payment
and performance of a portion of Parents or Merger Subs obligation to pay to
the Guaranteed Party (a) the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
8.4_ of the Merger Agreement, (b) the indemnification and reimbursement
obligations owing to the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives under _Section 6.19(i)_ of the Merger Agreement, and (c)
damages for Fraud or Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Sub in accordance with
and subject to _Section 8.2(a)_ of the Merger Agreement (clauses (a), (b) and
(c), collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "), on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and herein, in an
amount equal to the percentage of the Maximum Aggregate Amount (as defined
below) set forth opposite such Guarantors name on  _Exhibit A_ hereto (such
amount with respect to each Guarantor is such Guarantors " _Maximum Guarantor
Amount_ "); _provided_ that the maximum liability of each Guarantor hereunder
shall not exceed such Guarantors Maximum Guarantor Amount and the maximum
aggregate liability of the Guarantors hereunder shall not exceed
$66,597,220.70 (the " _Maximum Aggregate Amount_ "), it being understood and
agreed that this Limited Guarantee may not be enforced without giving full
and absolute effect to the Maximum Aggregate Amount and each Maximum Guarantor
Amount. The Guaranteed Party hereby agrees that the Guarantors shall in no
event be required to pay to any Person or Persons in the aggregate more than
the Maximum Aggregate Amount (and that no Guarantor shall be required to pay
to any Person or Persons in the aggregate more than such Guarantors Maximum
Guarantor Amount) under, in respect of, or in connection with this Limited
Guarantee or the Merger Agreement, and no Guarantor shall have any obligation
or liability to any Person under this Limited Guarantee or the Merger
Agreement other than as expressly set forth herein. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Limited Guarantee or in the Merger
Agreement, the Guaranteed Party hereby agrees that to the extent Parent and
Merger Sub are relieved of all or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations by
satisfaction thereof on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
the Merger Agreement or pursuant to any other agreement with the Guaranteed
Party, each Guarantor shall be similarly relieved, to such extent, of its
respective obligations under this Limited Guarantee.

 

2\. _Terms of Limited Guarantee; Recovery Claim_.

 

(a) This Limited Guarantee is an unconditional guarantee of payment and
performance, not collection, and a separate action or actions may be brought
and prosecuted against the Guarantors to enforce this Limited Guarantee,
irrespective of whether any action is

 



Exhibit A-2  brought against Parent or any other Person or whether Parent or any other
Person is joined in any such action or actions. Each Guarantor reserves the
right, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, to (i) set
off any amount owed hereunder by such Guarantor against any payment owing by
the Guaranteed Party to Parent or any of the Guarantors, and (ii) assert any
and all defenses which Parent or any of the Guarantors may have against
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.

(b) The liability of the Guarantors under this Limited Guarantee shall, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, be absolute and
unconditional, irrespective of:

(i) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent,
Merger Sub or any Guarantor or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization,
liquidation or other similar proceeding of Parent, Merger Sub, any Guarantor
or affecting any of their respective assets;

(ii) any change in the manner, place or terms of payment or performance, or
any change or extension of the time of payment or performance of, renewal or
alteration of, the Guaranteed Obligations, any liability incurred directly or
indirectly in respect thereof, or any amendment or waiver of or any consent to
any departure from the terms of the Merger Agreement or the documents entered
into in connection therewith, in each case, made in accordance with the terms
thereof;

 

(iii) the existence of any claim, set-off or other right that any of the
Guarantors may have at any time against Parent, whether in connection with
any of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise; or

(iv) any action or inaction on the part of the Guaranteed Party that is not
in violation of the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Equity Commitment
Letter of the Guarantors, dated as of even date herewith (the " _Equity
Commitment Letter_ "), or this Limited Guarantee, including, without
limitation, the absence of any attempt to assert any claim or demand against
Parent or collect the Guaranteed Obligations from Parent or the Guarantors.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Limited
Guarantee, each of the Guarantors shall be fully released and discharged
hereunder if the Guaranteed Obligations are paid in full by Parent or any
other Person in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

(c) The Guarantors hereby expressly waive any and all rights or defenses
arising by reason of any Law which would otherwise require any election of
remedies by the Guaranteed Party. The Guarantors waive promptness, diligence,
notice of acceptance of this Limited Guarantee and of the Guaranteed
Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance,
default, dishonor and protest, notice of the incurrence of any Guaranteed
Obligations and all other notices of any kind (except for notices to be
provided to Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement), all defenses which may
be available by virtue of any stay, moratorium Law or other similar Law now or
hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshaling of assets of Parent
or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, and all suretyship defenses generally (other than (i) fraud or
willful

 



Exhibit A-3  breach by the Guaranteed Party or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) defenses to
the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations that are available to Parent or
Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement, (iii) breach by the Guaranteed Party
of this Limited Guarantee or (iv) payment in full of the Guaranteed
Obligations). The Guarantors acknowledge that they will receive substantial
direct and indirect benefits from consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this
Limited Guarantee are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

 

(d) In the event any payment to the Guaranteed Party in respect of any
Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or otherwise must be (and is) returned to
the Guarantors for any reason whatsoever, the Guarantors shall remain liable
hereunder with respect to the Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had not
been made to the extent such Guarantors are in fact liable for such
payment hereunder.

3\. _Sole Remedy_.

 

(a) The Guaranteed Party acknowledges and agrees that:

 

(i) the sole cash asset of Parent is cash in a _de minimis_ amount, and that
no additional funds are expected to be contributed to Parent unless and until
the Acceptance Time or the Effective Time;

(ii) the Guarantors shall not have any obligation or liability to any Person
relating to, arising out of or in connection with the Merger Agreement, this
Limited Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter, or the transactions
contemplated thereby or hereby, other than as expressly set forth herein or
in the Equity Commitment Letter; and

(iii) it has no and shall have no right of recovery against the Guarantors or
any of any Guarantors Related Persons (as defined below), through any
Guarantor, Parent or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate, limited liability company or limited partnership veil, by or
through a claim by or on behalf of Parent against the Guarantors or any
Related Person of any Guarantor, or otherwise, except for its rights against
the Guarantors under this Limited Guarantee pursuant to the terms and subject
to the conditions hereof and Retained Claims (as defined below).

(b) Recourse against the Guarantors under this Limited Guarantee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of the Guaranteed Party and all of its Affiliates (as defined in
the Merger Agreement) against the Guarantors and any of Guarantors Related
Persons in respect of any breaches, losses or damages arising under, or in
connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby, including in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to
be made in connection therewith (other than any (a) remedies available
pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the Equity Commitment
Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, and (b) remedies available against
Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger Agreement under the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof (clauses (a) and (b), collectively, the "
_Retained Claims_ "). The Guaranteed Party hereby covenants and agrees that it
shall not institute, and shall 

 



Exhibit A-4  cause its controlled Related Persons not to institute, any proceeding or
bring any other claim (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter, the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter, or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection therewith, against
any Guarantor or its Related Persons, except for claims of the Guaranteed
Party against the Guarantors under this Limited Guarantee and Retained Claims.
As used in this Limited Guarantee, the term " _Related Person_ " shall mean,
with respect to any Person, any former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holder, controlling person, general or limited partner, shareholder,
member, manager, director, officer, employee, agent, affiliate, assignee,
Representative or Financing Source or other financing source of such Person,
or any former, current or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling
person, general or limited partner, shareholder, member, manager, director,
officer, employee, agent, affiliate, assignee, Representative or Financing
Source or other financing source of any of the foregoing, in each case other
than the Guarantors, or Parent and Merger Sub, and their respective assignees
under the Merger Agreement.

 

(c) Without prejudice to any right to specific performance that the Guaranteed
Party may have under the Merger Agreement, the Guaranteed Party further
covenants and agrees that it shall not have the right to recover, and shall
not recover, and it shall not institute, directly or indirectly, and shall
cause its controlled Related Persons not to institute, any proceeding or bring
any other claim to recover, more than the Maximum Aggregate Amount in respect
of any liabilities or obligations of the Guarantors, their permitted assigns,
Parent or Merger Sub, or the applicable Maximum Guarantor Amount from each
Guarantor and its permitted assigns in respect of any liabilities or
obligations of the Guarantors, their permitted assigns, Parent or Merger Sub,
arising under or in connection with the Merger Agreement, this Limited
Guarantee or the transactions contemplated thereby or hereby, and the
Guaranteed Party shall promptly return all monies paid to it or its Related
Persons in excess of the Maximum Aggregate Amount or applicable Maximum
Guarantor Amount.

 

(d) Nothing set forth in this Limited Guarantee shall confer or give to any
Person other than the Guaranteed Party any rights or remedies against any
Person, including the Guarantors, except as expressly set forth herein. The
Guaranteed Party acknowledges that each Guarantor is agreeing to enter into
this Limited Guarantee in reliance on the provisions set forth in
this Section 3\. This Section 3 shall survive termination of this Limited
Guarantee.

4\. _Representations and Warranties_. Each Guarantor hereby represents and
warrants with respect to itself that:

state of organization;

any benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement,

(g) such Guarantor acknowledges that in consideration of the execution and
delivery of the Merger Agreement by the Company, the Company is relying on

5\. _Termination_. This Limited Guarantee shall terminate and the Guarantors
shall have no further obligation under this Limited Guarantee as of the
earliest to occur of: (i) the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(ii) consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement; (iii) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with its terms in any circumstances where Parent is not obligated to make any
payment of any Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) 90 days after the valid
termination of the Merger Agreement if the Merger Agreement is terminated in
any of the circumstances pursuant to which Parent would be obligated to make
a payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, _provided_ that if on or prior
to the date of termination of this Limited Guarantee any written claim has
been made asserting that any of the Guaranteed Obligations are owing to the
Guaranteed Party, then this Limited Guarantee shall not terminate until such
matters are finally and conclusively resolved; and (v) the termination of this
Limited Guarantee by mutual written agreement of the

 



Exhibit A-6  Guarantors and the Guaranteed Party. Upon any termination of this Limited
Guarantee in accordance with this Section 5, no Person shall have any rights

Parties under the Merger Agreement, this Limited Guarantee, the Equity
Commitment Letter or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to
be made in connection herewith, whether at Law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise, and none of Parent, the Guarantors or their respective
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of the Merger Agreement, this Limited Guarantee, the Equity
Commitment Letter, in respect of the transactions contemplated thereby or
hereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith. In the event that the Guaranteed Party or
any controlled Related Person of the Guaranteed Party asserts in any
litigation (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise)
relating to this Limited Guarantee that the provisions of Section 1 hereof
limiting the Guarantors liability to the Maximum Aggregate Amount or any
Guarantors liability to such Guarantors Maximum Guarantor Amount or the
provisions of Section 3 hereof are illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole
or in part, or asserts any theory of liability against any Guarantor or any
of its Related Persons with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement (including in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection therewith) other than liability of
the Guarantors under this Limited Guarantee (as limited by the provisions of
Section 1), liability related to the Retained Claims, liability of the
Guarantors under the Equity Commitment Letter or liability of Parent or Merger
Sub pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, (i) the obligations of
each Guarantor under this Limited Guarantee shall terminate forthwith and
shall thereupon be null and void, (ii) if any Guarantor has previously made
any payments under this Limited Guarantee, such Guarantor shall be entitled
to recover such payments from the Guaranteed Party and (iii) none of the
Guarantors nor any of their respective Related Persons shall have any
liability to the Guaranteed Party or any of its Related Persons with respect
to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Equity
Commitment Letter or this Limited Guarantee (including in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection therewith or
herewith). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on or prior to the date of
termination of this Limited Guarantee any proceeding to enforce this Limited
Guarantee has been commenced, then the Guarantors obligations hereunder shall
survive such termination until such proceeding is finally and conclusively
resolved; _provided_ that any such proceeding shall have been instituted in
accordance with Sections 16 and 17 hereof and shall remain subject to all
terms and conditions hereof, including the limitations on liability of the
Guarantors set forth herein (including the Maximum Aggregate Amount and the
applicable Maximum Guarantor Amount).

 

6\. _Continuing Guarantee_. Except to the extent terminated pursuant to the
provisions of Section 5 of this Limited Guarantee, this Limited Guarantee is
a continuing one and shall remain in full force and effect until the payment
and satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, shall be binding upon
the Guarantors, their successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the Guaranteed Party and its successors, permitted
transferees and permitted assigns. All obligations to which this Limited
Guarantee applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively
presumed to have been created in reliance hereon.

7\. _Entire Agreement_. This Limited Guarantee constitutes the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes any and all prior

 



Exhibit A-7  discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and
agreements, whether written or oral, among Parent, Merger Sub and the
Guarantors or any of their Related Persons, on the one hand, and the
Guaranteed Party or any of its Related Persons, on the other hand. Except as
provided in this Limited Guarantee, no representation or warranty has been
made or relied upon by any of the parties to this Limited Guarantee with
respect to this Limited Guarantee.

8\. _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Limited Guarantee will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each of the Guarantors and the
Guaranteed Party or, in the case of a waiver, by the party or each of the
parties against whom the waiver is to be effective. No waiver by any party of
any breach or violation of, or default under, this Limited Guarantee, whether
intentional or not, will be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
breach, violation or default hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising
by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No partial exercise,
failure, delay or omission on the part of any party in exercising any right,
power, privilege or remedy under this Limited Guarantee will operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Guaranteed
Party of any right, remedy or power under this Limited Guarantee preclude any
other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power under this Limited
Guarantee. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the
Guaranteed Party or allowed the Guaranteed Party by Law or other agreement
shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by
the Guaranteed Party at any time or from time to time.

 

9\. _Counterparts_. This Limited Guarantee may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Limited Guarantee
will become effective when duly executed by each party hereto. A signature
hereto sent or delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission shall
be as legally binding and enforceable as a signed original for all purposes.

10\. _Notices_. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly given and made as follows: (a) if sent by registered or
certified mail in the United States, return receipt requested, then
such communication shall be deemed duly given and made upon receipt; (b) if

p.m. (addressees local time) on any Business Day, then such communication
shall be deemed duly given and made when receipt is confirmed; (d) if sent by
facsimile or email transmission on a day other than a Business Day and receipt
is confirmed, or if sent after 5:00 p.m. (addressees local time) on any
Business Day and receipt is confirmed, then such communication shall be
deemed duly given and made on the Business Day following the date on which
receipt is confirmed; and (e) if otherwise actually personally delivered to a
duly authorized representative of the recipient, then such communication
shall be deemed duly given and made when delivered to such authorized
representative; _provided_ , that such notices, requests, demands and other
communications are delivered to the address set forth below, or to such other

Agreement.

assigned or delegated by either the Guarantors or the Guaranteed Party to any
other Person without the prior written consent of the Guaranteed Party (in
the case of an assignment by any Guarantor) or each of the Guarantors (in the
case of an assignment by the Guaranteed Party) and any purported assignment
without such consent shall be null and void and of no force and effect,
except that if a portion of any Guarantors commitment under the Equity

 



Exhibit A-9  Commitment Letter is assigned in accordance with the terms thereof, then a
corresponding portion of the Guaranteed Obligations hereunder may be assigned
to the same assignee; _provided_ that any such assignment will not relieve
such Guarantor of its obligations under this Limited Guarantee.

12\. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Limited Guarantee is not intended
to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder, except that each Related Person of any Guarantor
shall be considered a third party beneficiary of the provisions of Section 3
hereof.

13\. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Limited Guarantee that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this Limited Guarantee may not be enforced without giving full and
absolute effect to the limitation of the amount payable by the Guarantors
hereunder to the Maximum Aggregate Amount and by each Guarantor to its
Maximum Guarantor Amount provided in Section 1 hereof and to the provisions of
Section 3 hereof. No party hereto shall assert, and each party shall cause its
respective Affiliates and representatives not to assert, that this Limited
Guarantee or any part hereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

14\. _Interpretation_. The headings and titles contained in this Limited
Guarantee are for convenience purposes only and will not in any way affect the

of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any provision of this Limited Guarantee.

15\. _Confidentiality_. This Limited Guarantee shall be treated
as confidential by the Guaranteed Party and is being provided to the
Guaranteed Party solely in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement. This Limited Guarantee may not be used, circulated,
quoted or otherwise referred to in any document (other than the Merger
Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter), except with the written consent
of each of the Guarantors or to the extent required by Law, the applicable
rules of any national securities exchange or in connection with any U.S.

16\. _Governing Law; Forum_. All issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Limited
Guarantee shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of

Exhibit A-10  other jurisdiction) that would result in the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Each party to this Limited
Guarantee hereby irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Limited Guarantee or any transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought exclusively in the Delaware Court of
Chancery in and for New Castle County, or in the event (but only in
the event) that such Delaware Court of Chancery does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such legal action or proceeding, the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware, or in the event (but only in the event)
that such United States District Court also does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such legal action or proceeding, any Delaware State court
sitting in New Castle County, hereby expressly submits to the personal
jurisdiction and venue of such court for the purposes thereof and expressly
waives any claim of improper venue and any claim that such courts are an
inconvenient forum, and hereby agrees that it will not bring any claim in any
court other than such court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party to
this Limited Guarantee hereby agrees that it will not bring or support any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Limited Guarantee or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than a court of competent
jurisdiction located within the City of New York, New York, whether a state or
Federal court, and that the provisions of Section 17 relating to the waiver of
jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim.

17\. _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING UNDER THIS LIMITED GUARANTEE OR ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, REGARDLESS
