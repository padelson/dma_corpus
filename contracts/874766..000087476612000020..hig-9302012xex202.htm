The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such
notice. A breach of this Section 7.3 shall not be considered for purposes of
determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX or
Article X, give rise to a right of termination or give rise to a right to
indemnification under this Agreement if the underlying breach or breaches
would not result in the failure of the conditions set forth in Article IX or
Article X to be fulfilled, the right to terminate this Agreement or the right
to obtain indemnification, as the case may be.

documentation prior to the submission of such documentation to any
Governmental Body. Buyer shall make the regulatory filings for the approvals
described in Items 2 and 3 of Section 6.2(b)(ii) of the Buyer Disclosure

preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, by the Ancillary Agreements or the GUL
Term Sheet in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof unlawful or that
would prevent or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the GUL Term Sheet, then, to the extent
necessary to comply with such conditions or to prevent the taking of such
action or the enactment, entry, enforcement or promulgation of any such
Applicable Law or to vacate, modify or suspend any such injunction or order,
Buyer shall offer to accept an order to (A) divest such portion of (1) the
Business or (2) the assets and businesses of Buyer and its Affiliates, (B)
terminate any existing relationships or contractual rights and obligations,
(C) hold separate such assets and businesses pending such divestiture or (D)
otherwise take or commit to take actions that, after the Closing Date, would
limit Buyer's or its Affiliates' freedom of action with respect to, or ability
to retain, one or more of the businesses, locations, employees, product lines
or assets of Buyer and its Affiliates, in each case, so as to 













permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, by the
Ancillary Agreements and by the GUL Term Sheet on a schedule as close as
possible to that contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements;

whole ("Material Negative Condition").

(iii) Prior to Closing, if any Party or an Affiliate thereof receives an
inquiry or request for information or documentary material from any
Governmental Body with respect to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or
the GUL Term Sheet or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
then such Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, or cause
to be provided, to such Governmental Body, as promptly as practicable and
after consultation with the other Party, an appropriate response to such
inquiry or request.

(iv) Prior to Closing, the Parties shall keep each other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the GUL Term Sheet and work

relating to the GUL Reinsurance Transaction, Buyer shall only be required to
provide Seller with portions of such filings that are relevant to the rights,
benefits or obligations of Seller or Cedants thereunder;

(E) not participating in any substantive meeting, discussion or conversation
with any Governmental Body in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, unless it consults with the other
Party in advance to the extent it is reasonably practicable to do so, and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Body, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate therein; provided, that in the case of
any meeting, discussion or conversation with any

opinions and proposals that are relevant to the rights, benefits or
obligations of Seller or Cedants thereunder.

(b) Third-Party Consents.

(i) Prior to Closing, each Party shall cooperate with the other and use
Consent Efforts to obtain all Third-Party Consents required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, including for the transfer of the Acquired Assets and
the Transferred Contracts to Buyer or one of its Affiliates, including those
listed in Section 7.4(b)(i) of the Business Disclosure Schedule. The first
$1,000,000 of aggregate costs (including any license or other fees and
expenses) associated with obtaining such Third-Party Consents or obtaining
rights to replace any related assets (other than any Third-Party Consents
described in Section 8.13(c), such Third-Party Consents being separately
subject to Section 8.13(c)) shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and
fifty percent (50%) by Seller and any such costs in excess of $1,000,000 shall
be borne exclusively by Seller, it being understood that neither Party shall
be required to expend any amount in order to obtain any such Third-Party
Consent in excess of such Party's share of such costs as described in this
Section 7.4(b)(i).

(ii) To the extent that any Acquired Asset (including any Transferred
Contract) may not be transferred or assigned to Buyer or one of its Affiliates
without a Third-Party Consent and such Third-Party Consent has not been
obtained by the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
transfer or assign the same if an attempted transfer or assignment would
constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or would be ineffective or
unlawful; provided, that, for so long as the Transition Services Agreement
remains in effect, Seller shall use Consent Efforts, with Buyer's cooperation,
to negotiate and obtain any such Third-Party Consent, to the extent required
to permit Buyer or one of its Affiliates, on behalf of Seller, to perform
Seller's obligations so that Buyer or one of its Affiliates can be provided
with the benefits of such Contract (with such cost allocated as described in
Section 7.4(b)(i), and neither Party being required to expend any amount in
order to obtain any such Third-Party Consent in excess of such Party's share
of such costs as described in Section 7.4(b)(i)). If, on the Closing Date, any
Third-Party Consent required to effect the transfer of any Acquired Asset to
Buyer or one of its Affiliates is not obtained, or if an attempted transfer or
assignment thereof would be ineffective or unlawful, then Seller shall use its
Consent Efforts, with Buyer's cooperation, to implement a mutually agreeable
arrangement by which Buyer or one of its Affiliates would, in compliance with
Applicable Law, be able to obtain all of the benefits and assume the
obligations and bear the economic burdens associated with such Acquired Asset
(with any related Third-Party Consent cost allocated as described in Section
7.4(b)(i), and neither Party being required to expend any 













amount in order to obtain any such Third-Party Consent in excess of such
Party's share of such costs as described in Section 7.4(b)(i)). Such
arrangement may include (A) provision of transition services under the
Transition Services Agreement, subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing by
Seller or one of its Affiliates to Buyer or one of its Affiliates, or (B)
having Seller or one of its Affiliates enforce, for the benefit (and at the
expense) of Buyer or one of its Affiliates any and all of their respective
rights against any non-affiliated third party associated with such Acquired
Asset, in which case Seller would promptly pay, or cause its Affiliates to
pay, to Buyer or one of its Affiliates when received all monies received by
Seller or its Affiliates in connection with any such Acquired Asset. For the
avoidance of doubt, the alternative arrangements contemplated in clauses (A)
and (B) of this Section 7.4(b)(ii) shall be made available for the term of the
applicable Transferred Contract and charged at no additional cost to Buyer
other than the those costs arising under such Transferred Contract that are
passed through to Buyer. From and after the Closing Date for so long as the
Transition Services Agreement remains in effect, the Parties shall continue to
use Consent Efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, any required Third-
Party Consents that have not been obtained as of the Closing Date; provided,
that, except as expressly provided in this Section 7.4, neither Party shall be
required to expend any amount in order to obtain any such Third-Party Consent
in excess of such Party's share of such costs as described in Section
7.4(b)(i).

Section 7.5 Shared Contracts.

(a) From and after the Closing Date and for so long as the Transition Services
Agreement remains in effect, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the counterparty to any Shared
Contract that is not a Transferred Contract to enter into a new agreement, on
substantially the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Shared
Contract, with Buyer or one of its Affiliates with respect to the matters
addressed by such Shared Contract that are related to the Business; provided,
that Seller shall not be required to compromise any right, asset or benefit or
expend any amount or incur any Liabilities or provide any other consideration
in connection therewith.

(b) From and after the Closing Date and for so long as the Transition Services
Agreement remains in effect, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to

Schedule to enter into a new agreement, on substantially the same terms and
conditions as those set forth in the Shared Contract, with Seller or its
Affiliates with respect to the matters addressed by such Shared Contract that
are not related to the Business; provided, that Buyer shall not be required to
compromise any right, asset or benefit or expend any amount or incur any
Liabilities or provide any other consideration in connection therewith.

(c) With respect to any Shared Contract that is not a Transferred Contract,
until such time as Buyer or one of its Affiliates enters into a new agreement
with the counterparty to the Shared Contract pursuant to Section 7.5(a),
Seller shall use Consent Efforts, with Buyer's cooperation, to implement a
mutually agreeable arrangement by which Buyer or one of its Affiliates would,
in compliance with Applicable Law, be able to obtain all of the benefits and
assume the obligations and bear the economic burdens associated with such
Shared Contract to the extent related to the Business. Such arrangement may
include (A) provision of transition services under the Transition Services
Agreement, or subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing by Seller or one of
its Affiliates to Buyer, or (B) having Seller or one of its Affiliates
enforce, for the benefit (and at the expense) of Buyer or one of its
Affiliates any and all of their respective rights against any non-affiliated

Affiliates in connection with any such Shared Contract to the extent related
to the Business. For the avoidance of doubt, the alternative arrangements

available for the term of the applicable Shared Contract and charged at no
additional cost to Buyer other than the those costs arising under such Shared
Contract with respect to the Business that are passed through to Buyer. The
costs of obtaining any Third-Party Consents in connection with the
arrangements contemplated in this Section 7.5(c) shall be allocated as
described in Section 7.4(b)(i); it being understood that neither Party shall
be required to expend any amount in order to obtain any such Third-Party
Consent in excess of such Party's share of such costs as provided in Section
7.4(b)(i).

ARTICLE VIII

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS Section 8.1 Employee Matters.

(a) Comparable Position.

(i) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall
(A)

update Section 8.1(a) of the Business Disclosure Schedule to add any
individuals who become Business Employees after the date hereof and remove any
individuals who have ceased to be Business Employees after the date hereof and
(B) deliver such updated list of Business Employees to Buyer. Within sixty
(60) days after the date of this Agreement or, if later, within thirty (30)
days of the date Seller reports to Buyer that an individual has become a
Business Employee (but not later than five (5) days prior to the Closing
Date), Buyer or its Affiliate shall extend to each Business Employee a written
offer of employment, effective as of the Closing Date (or such later date as
is set forth below with respect to those Business Employees employed by Seller
or any of its Affiliates who are Inactive Business Employees), that
constitutes a Comparable Position with Buyer or its Affiliates (an "Offer of
Employment"). Prior to Buyer or its Affiliate making any Offer of Employment,
(i) Seller shall provide or make available to Buyer or its Affiliate a
schedule listing the then current base salary, target bonus percentage and
other compensation (including any compensation for a Business Employee covered
by a Seller Sales Incentive Plan) in effect for the year in which the Closing
occurs and (ii) Buyer shall provide Seller with a "form of" Offer of
Employment that shall set forth the job title, base salary and annual bonus
opportunity a Business Employee will have with Buyer or its Affiliates
following the Business Employee's Effective Hire Date (as defined below). Each
Offer of Employment shall be contingent on such Business Employee's successful
completion of Buyer's or its Affiliate's customary hiring processes as set
forth on Section 8.1(a)(i) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule (the "Buyer's
Customary Hiring Processes"). Buyer shall not be required to hire any Business
Employee who fails to successfully complete Buyer's Customary Hiring Processes
or who does not timely accept Buyer's Offer of Employment. Except in the case
of an Inactive Business Employee who is on a military leave of absence, Offers
of Employment made to Inactive Business Employees shall be contingent on the
Inactive Business Employee being released to return to work within nine (9)
months of the Closing Date, and Buyer shall not be required to hire any
Inactive Business Employee who fails to meet that contingency.

Except as set forth below with respect to Inactive Business Employees, the
employment relationship of each Business Employee with Seller or its
applicable Affiliate shall terminate effective as of 11:59 p.m., New York City
time, on the Closing Date. A Business Employee who successfully completes
Buyer's Customary Hiring Process, who has accepted Buyer's Offer of 













Employment and who performs work at his or her then applicable place of
employment on the first (1st) Business Day immediately following the Closing
Date (or on the first (1st) Business Day on or after the Effective Hire Date,
as defined below, in the case of Inactive Business Employees) shall be
considered a "Transferred Employee" for purposes of this Agreement.

(ii) Inactive Business Employees shall remain employed by Seller or its
Affiliate, as the case may be, until the earlier of the date the Inactive
Business Employee becomes a Transferred Employee or the expiration of the
Inactive Business Employee's leave under Seller's or such applicable
Affiliate's policies. An Inactive Business Employee shall not become a
Transferred Employee until (i) the first (1st) Business Day following the
Inactive Business Employee's release to return to work from the leave, (ii)
the Inactive Business Employee accepts Buyer's Offer of Employment, (iii) he
or she successfully completes Buyer's Customary Hiring Processes, and (iv) he
or she performs work at his or her then applicable place of employment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Inactive Business Employee who is receiving
long-term disability payments from Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates
(whether or not pursuant to an Employee Benefit Plan) at the time such
Inactive Business Employee is released to return to work shall not become a
Transferred Employee, and Seller shall retain all Liabilities associated with
such Inactive Business Employee.

(iii) Subject to the Business Employee's acceptance of Buyer's Offer of
Employment, the date on which a Business Employee commences employment with
Buyer or its Affiliates will be referred to as the "Effective Hire Date"
which, for purposes of clarification, means (x) the day immediately following
the Closing Date for all Business Employees other than Inactive Business
Employees, and (y) for any Inactive Business Employee, on the first (1st)
Business Day immediately following the day such Inactive Business Employee
becomes a Transferred Employee.

(b) Employee Communications. During the period from the date hereof through
the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller will reasonably cooperate to communicate to
the Business Employees the details of the proposed terms and conditions of
their employment with Buyer or its Affiliates. All communications between
Buyer or its Affiliates and the Business Employees shall be subject to
Seller's reasonable prior approval which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(c) Maintenance of Terms. From a Transferred Employee's Effective Hire Date
through the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date or such earlier date
on which such Transferred Employee's employment with Buyer and its Affiliates
terminates, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide such
Transferred Employee with (i) a Comparable Position and (ii) participation in
employee benefit plans, policies, practices or agreements (other than with
respect to base salary and bonus opportunity) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefit, plans, policies,
practices or agreements that are provided to similarly situated employees of
Buyer and which shall include participation in Buyer's long term incentive
plan in the same manner as similarly situated employees of Buyer.

(d) Work Permits. Buyer shall take, or cause its Affiliates to take, all
necessary steps to sponsor, or transfer sponsorship of, the work permits for
all Transferred Employees who are foreign nationals, and agrees to so sponsor,
or cause its Affiliates to so sponsor, such foreign national Transferred
Employees on and after the Closing; provided, that each such foreign national
Transferred Employee's name, position, country of citizenship and type of work
permit are disclosed on Section 8.1(d) of the Business Disclosure Schedule.
Seller shall cooperate as necessary to effect Buyer's or its Affiliates'
sponsorship or transfer of sponsorship of all such foreign national
Transferred Employees. 













(e) Employee Benefits. Buyer and its Affiliates shall waive, or shall cause to
be waived, any

waiting period, probationary period, pre-existing condition exclusion,
evidence of insurability requirement, or similar condition with respect to
initial participation under any plan, program, or arrangement established,
maintained, or contributed to by Buyer or any of its Affiliates to provide
health insurance, life insurance, or disability benefits with respect to each
Transferred Employee who has, prior to the Effective Hire Date, satisfied,
under Seller's or its Affiliates' comparable plans, the comparable
eligibility, insurability or other requirements referred to in this sentence.
Buyer and its Affiliates shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the
dollar amount of all co-insurance, deductibles and similar expenses incurred
by each Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the
calendar year in which the Effective Hire Date occurs for purposes of
satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment limitations under the medical
plan in which each Transferred Employee will be eligible to participate from
and after the Effective Hire Date, subject to the provision by Seller or its
Affiliates to the plan administrator or the third-party administrator of the
applicable medical plan of Buyer of relevant information or documentation
confirming the amount of such co-insurance, deductibles and similar expenses
for each Transferred Employee. Each Transferred Employee shall, for purposes
of determining such Transferred Employee's eligibility to participate in,
vesting and calculating the benefit accrual for paid time off and calculating
severance under all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements of Buyer
and its Affiliates (other than any equity or equity based plan or retiree
medical savings account), be credited with the service of such Transferred
Employee with Seller or its Affiliates to the same extent as if such service
had been performed for Buyer or any of its Affiliates. In addition to the
foregoing, Buyer shall, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to:

(i) from the Closing Date to the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date,
provide Transferred Employees with the Buyer Severance Benefits, provided,
that Buyer or its Affiliates will provide Transferred Employees who are
included in the categories set forth in Schedule 8.1(e)(i) of the Business
Disclosure Schedule immediately before their Effective Hire Date, benefits
with the greater of (x) the cash severance payments portion of the Buyer
Severance Benefits and (y) the Seller Severance Benefit. For the avoidance of
doubt, Transferred Employees who receive severance benefits under this
paragraph also shall be eligible to receive a minimum sixty (60) day
termination notice period or pay in lieu of such notice and subsidized COBRA
benefits provided under the plan, practice or agreement of Buyer or its
Affiliates applicable to similarly situated employees, taking into account the
Transferred Employee's length of service with Seller and its Affiliates.

(ii) cause the defined contribution plan(s) maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates to accept a direct rollover of the account balance of any
Transferred Employee in the investment and savings plan of Seller or its
Affiliate or any other Tax-qualified retirement plan of Seller or its
Affiliate, that a Transferred Employee elects to make as a direct rollover,
and, to the extent necessary, amend such defined contribution plan(s) prior to
the Closing in order to carry out the intent of this Section, subject to
Buyer's receipt from Seller of a current determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service that the applicable investment and savings plan or
other retirement plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the
Code, and such other information as Buyer may reasonably request;

(iii) from the Closing Date through the first (1st) anniversary of the
Closing, provide Transferred Employees with the greater of (i) the vacation
and paid time off accrual rate and maximum accrual the Transferred Employee
would have been eligible to receive under the applicable plan, policy or
agreement of Seller or its Affiliates covering the Transferred Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Hire Date excluding any accruals
attributable to additional vacation and paid time off purchased by the
Transferred Employee and (ii) the vacation and paid time off accrual rate and
maximum accrual the Transferred Employee would be eligible to receive 













under the plan, policy or agreement of Buyer or its Affiliates applicable to
such Transferred Employee following the Effective Hire Date; and

(iv) reimburse Transferred Employees for education courses for which such

Transferred Employees registered prior to the Effective Hire Date; provided,
that Transferred Employees have not already been reimbursed therefor, to the
extent that Seller's or its Affiliates' policies would provide for such
reimbursement if such Transferred Employees had continued to be employed by
Seller or its Affiliate.

(f) Paid Time Off. Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to pay to each
Transferred Employee the amount of compensation due in respect of the unused
paid time off accrued by such Transferred Employee as of the date such
Transferred Employee's employment with Seller or its Affiliates is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1(a).

(g) Annual Incentive Bonus and Sales Incentive Plans

(i) Seller shall, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to, pay, no
later than March 15, 2013, the bonus for the 2012 year under Seller's Annual
Incentive Plan to Transferred Employees who were covered under that plan
immediately prior to the Closing and who (A) continue to be employed by Buyer
or its Affiliates as of March 15, 2013, or (B) whose employment with Buyer or
its Affiliates is involuntarily terminated (other than for cause) prior to
March 15, 2013. The amount to be so paid by Seller or its Affiliates to all
such Transferred Employees (the "2012 Bonus Pool") shall be an amount equal to
(1) the greater of (x) one hundred percent (100%), and (y) a bonus funding
factor, as determined by Seller or its Affiliates in good faith taking into
account the performance of the Business and other factors comparable to those
taken into account by Seller or its Affiliates in determining bonuses under
the Seller Annual Incentive Plan for participants in other businesses,
multiplied by (2) the target bonus pool applicable to the Transferred
Employees under the Seller Annual Incentive Plan, based on such Transferred
Employees' tier and pay immediately prior to the Closing. In the event that
the Closing Date occurs prior to December 31, 2012, Buyer or its Affiliates
shall reimburse Seller for the portion of the 2012 Bonus Pool that is
attributable to the period following the Closing Date. The 2012 Bonus Pool
shall be distributed by Seller or its Affiliates in their discretion among
such Transferred Employees. In the event that the Closing Date occurs on or
after January 1, 2013, Seller shall, or shall cause one or more of its
Affiliates to, pay bonuses to Business Employees for the 2012 year under
Seller's Annual Incentive Plan in accordance with its normal practices but no
later than March 15, 2013; provided, that the total amount paid to Business
Employees shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the target
bonus pool under the Seller Annual Incentive Plan applicable to such Business
Employees; Seller or its Affiliates shall distribute such bonus pool among
eligible Business Employees in accordance with Seller's practices and policies
in effect prior to the Closing Date. In the event the Closing occurs after
December 31, 2012, Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide an incentive bonus
covering the entire 2013 calendar year, consistent with Section 8.1(c), and
Seller or its Affiliate shall reimburse Buyer for the portion of the 2013
bonus pool at Seller's target bonus level that is attributable to the period
commencing on January 1, 2013 and ending on the Closing Date to the extent
such amount is not reflected on the Transfer Balance Sheet.

(ii) Buyer shall, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to, assume each
Seller Sales Incentive Plan and shall or shall cause its Affiliates to perform
the obligations of Seller and its Affiliates thereunder solely to the extent
they relate to Liabilities that arise on and after the Closing Date. 













(h) Long-Term Incentive Awards.

(i) Seller and its Affiliates shall take any and all action necessary to cause
(A) the Vested Seller Equity Awards to vest immediately prior to the Closing
Date and (B) the Unvested Seller Equity Awards and the 2013 Unvested Seller
Equity Awards to be cancelled without payment effective as of the Closing
Date. Seller shall be responsible for all payment, liabilities and obligations
to which any Business Employee is entitled with respect to the Vested Seller
Equity Awards and shall make all payments necessary to satisfy such Awards to
the Business Employees in accordance with the terms of Seller\'s long term
incentive plan. Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, make all
payments necessary to satisfy the 2013 Unvested Seller Equity Awards as set
forth in Section 5.14(e) of the Business Disclosure Schedule for each Business
Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee, provided that for purposes of
calculating the value of the 2013 Unvested Seller Equity Awards, the value of
Seller\'s common stock shall be the average of the closing prices of a share
of Seller\'s common stock on each of the last 20 trading days of the month in
which the Closing Date occurs and provided further that, Buyer may, in its
discretion, make such payments in cash. Buyer and Seller agree to negotiate in
good faith to enter into a side letter setting forth the parties' obligations
and responsibilities with regard to the outstanding, unvested compensatory
equity awards held by the Tier 2 Business Employee.

(ii) Buyer and its Affiliates shall, grant to each Business Employee holding
Unvested Seller Equity Awards who becomes a Transferred Employee (such
Unvested Seller Equity Awards shall hereafter be referred to as the
"Transferred Employee Unvested Seller Equity Awards"), restricted stock units
("RSUs") under Buyer's long-term incentive program having a value equal to the
value of such Business Employee's Unvested Seller Equity Awards (the
"Replacement Equity Awards"). The value of the Transferred Employee Unvested
Seller Equity Awards (the "Replacement Equity Award Value") for purposes of
the Replacement Equity Awards shall be determined, for each of such Business
Employee's Transferred Employee Unvested Seller Equity Awards, by (1)
multiplying the number of RSUs subject to such Transferred Employee Unvested
Seller Equity Award by (2) the average of the closing prices of a share of
Seller\'s common stock on each of the last 20 trading days of the month in
which the Closing Date occurs. The number of Buyer RSUs to be granted to a
Transferred Employee as a Replacement Equity Award for a Transferred Employee
Unvested Seller Equity Award shall be determined by (1) dividing the
Replacement Equity Award Value by (2) the average of the closing prices of a
share of Buyer\'s common stock on each of the last 20 trading days of the
month in which the Closing Date occurs. Such Replacement Equity Awards shall
vest according to the Seller Vesting Schedule, and shall otherwise be subject
to the terms and conditions of Buyer's long-term incentive plan

(i) COBRA Coverage. Seller shall be responsible for all liabilities and
obligations

associated with the provision of COBRA coverage to any Business Employee or
any qualifying beneficiaries who experience a qualifying event at any time
prior to the Transferred Employee's Effective Hire Date.

(j) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Buyer and its
Affiliates

shall not assume any obligations under or Liabilities with respect to, or
receive any right or interest in any trusts relating to, any assets of or any
insurance, administration or other contracts pertaining to any Employee
Benefit Plan or other employee compensation or benefit plan, program, policy
or arrangement sponsored or maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates. 













(k) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Seller and its
Affiliates shall 
retain all obligations under, or Liabilities with respect to, all retention
agreements entered into by Seller or its Affiliates with Transferred Employees
whether or not fully satisfied as of the Closing Date and Seller and its
Affiliates shall not make any changes to such retention agreements, including
accelerating the timing of any payments thereunder, without Buyer's consent.
No sooner than 10 days prior to each of March 31, 2013 and September 30, 2013,
Seller shall provide Buyer with a written request for confirmation that the
Transferred Employees who are listed on Section 5.14(a)(i)(c) of the Business
Disclosure Schedule (the "Retention Employees") are actively employed by Buyer
or its Affiliates on the applicable date (March 31, 2013 or September 30,
2013). Within 10 days from receipt of each such written notice, Buyer shall
provide Seller with a written response indicating the Retention Employees who
are actively employed. In the event a Retention Employee\'s employment
terminates as a result of a job elimination at any time prior to October 1,
2013, Buyer will provide Seller with written notice of such Retention
Employee\'s termination within 10 days of termination. The Buyer\'s
obligations under this Section 8.1(k) are subject to any consent of the
Retention Employee as required by Applicable Law and are applicable to the
extent not otherwise prohibited by Applicable Law. Seller and its Affiliates\'
obligations to make payments to the Retention Employees under this Agreement

arising under the 
WARN Act on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to any Business
Employee.

(m) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, as 
appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Section 8.1. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and in order for Buyer to satisfy its
obligations under this Section 8.1, on and after the date of this Agreement,
Seller and its Affiliates shall provide Buyer with (i) reasonable access to
Business Employees, (ii) the information with respect to Business Employees
set forth in Section 8.1(m)(i) of the Business Disclosure Schedule, (iii) if
Buyer receives the consent of the Business Employee which requirement may be
satisfied by means of negative consent, the information with respect to the

regarding Business Employees that Buyer may reasonably request, to ensure that
Buyer can complete the transition of Business Employees prior to Closing which
request Seller shall not unreasonably deny.

(n) During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December
31, 2014, 
with respect to any Business Employee for whom Seller is crediting service
with Buyer for purposes of early retirement eligibility under The Hartford
Retirement Plan for U.S. Employees and solely to the extent necessary for
Seller to credit such service, Buyer will provide Seller, upon Seller's or a
Business Employee's written request, which request shall be reasonable in
nature and time, the Business Employee's date of employment termination and
whether such termination was a result of the elimination of the Business
Employee's position, subject to any consent of the Business Employee as
required by Applicable Law and to the extent not otherwise prohibited by
Applicable Law.

(o) No Amendment of Plans. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the 
contrary, no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does, constitute
the establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any employee benefit plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(3) of, or subject to, ERISA), and no Person
participating in any such employee benefit plan maintained by either Seller or
its Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates, shall have any claim or cause of
action, under ERISA or otherwise, in respect of any provision of this
Agreement as it relates to any such employee benefit plan or otherwise.

than the 
Transferred Owned Intellectual Property and other than as contemplated in the
Ancillary Agreements, Buyer is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise
obtaining any right, title or interest in or to any Intellectual Property
Rights of Seller or its Affiliates, including the name "Hartford" and any
Trademarks of Seller and its Affiliates and any visual representations
thereof, monograms, tag-lines, designs, symbols, images, colors and
characters, and any variation of the foregoing in this sentence and any word
or design that contains, incorporates or is confusingly similar in sound or
appearance to any of the foregoing (including all registrations and
applications relating thereto) (collectively, the "Seller Name and Marks"),
and, except as otherwise expressly provided in any Ancillary Agreement,
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any rights in the Seller
Name and Marks, and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall contest the
ownership or validity of any rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates in or
to the Seller Name and Marks.

(b) Buyer agrees that, except as otherwise provided in any Ancillary
Agreement, or in 
connection with historical references to the Business, following the Closing
Date, Buyer and its Affiliates shall cease and discontinue all uses of the
Seller Name and Marks, either alone or in combination with other words and all
marks, trade dress, logos, monograms and other source identifiers similar to
any of the foregoing or embodying any of the foregoing alone or in combination
with other words, including other words in compliance with Section 8.3(c).

(c) In accordance with the terms of the Ancillary Agreements and on the
date(s) specified 
therein, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, (i) re-label,
destroy, delete or exhaust all materials bearing the Seller Name and Marks,
including signage, advertising, promotional materials, Software, packaging,
inventory, electronic materials, collateral goods, stationery, business cards,
web sites and other materials (except to the extent any such materials must be
retained to comply with Applicable Laws or document retention notices issued
by any Governmental Body), and (ii) thereafter, send a written statement to
Seller verifying that it has re-labeled, destroyed, deleted or exhausted all
materials bearing the Seller Name and Marks and send Seller representative
samples of how Buyer is now using advertising and promotional materials that
do not include Seller Name and Marks to the extent required by (i) above.
Buyer shall take all necessary action to ensure that other users of the Seller
Name and Marks, whose rights terminate upon the Closing pursuant to this
Section 8.3, shall cease use of the Seller Name and Marks, except as expressly
authorized thereafter by Seller. Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees
that after the Closing Date Buyer and its Affiliates will not expressly, or by
implication, do business as or represent themselves as Seller or an Affiliate
of Seller.

(d) Buyer's rights and obligations with respect to its use of the Seller Name
and Marks shall 
be as set forth in the Transitional Trademark License Agreement and the
Trademark License Agreement.

(e) In the event Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer violates any of its
obligations under this 
Section 8.3, Seller and its Affiliates may proceed against it in law or in
equity for such damages or other relief as a court may deem appropriate. Buyer
acknowledges that a violation of this Section 8.3 may cause Seller and its
Affiliates irreparable harm, which may not be adequately compensated for by
money damages. Buyer therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or
threatened violation of this Section 8.3, Seller and any of its Affiliates
shall be entitled, in addition to other remedies that they may have, to seek a 













temporary restraining order and to seek preliminary and final injunctive
relief against Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer to prevent any violations of
this Section 8.3, without the necessity of posting a bond.

covenant or covenants, which shall be given full effect, without regard to the
invalid portions. If any of the restrictions or covenants contained in this
Section 8.4, or any portion thereof, are deemed to be unenforceable because
such covenant or restriction is held to cover a geographic area or to be of
such duration as is not permitted under Applicable Law, the Parties agree that
the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the
duration and/or areas of such provision and, in its reduced form, said
provision shall then be enforceable.

(g) Seller recognizes that the obligations of HFSG and its controlled
Affiliates under this Section 8.4 are special, unique and extraordinary in
character and that, in the event of any actual violation of any provision of
this Section 8.4, Buyer shall be entitled to institute and prosecute
proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction, either in law or in
equity, to obtain damages for any actual violation, enforce the specific
performance and/or enjoin any actions in violation of this Section 8.4.

relationship with any Transferred Employee unless such Person has not been
employed by Buyer or its Affiliates for a period of at least three (3) months
prior to such solicitation or such Person's employment has been terminated by
Buyer or its Affiliates (independent of any action of HFSG or its Affiliates)
prior to such solicitation; provided, that this Section 8.5(a) shall not
prohibit HFSG or its Affiliates from employing or hiring or entering into an

relationship with any employee of Seller or its Affiliates who provides
transition services to Buyer in connection with the Business pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement unless such Person has not been employed by
Seller or its Affiliates for a period of at least three (3) months prior to
such solicitation or such Person's employment has been terminated by Seller or
its Affiliates (independent of any action of Buyer or its Affiliates) prior to
such solicitation; provided, that this Section 8.5(b) shall not prohibit Buyer
or its Affiliates from employing or hiring or entering into an independent
contractor relationship with any Person who contacts Buyer or any of its
Affiliates on his or her own initiative without direct solicitation or as a
result of general solicitations for employment or independent contractor
relationships through advertisements or other means that are not personally
directed at any such Person. 













(c) The Parties acknowledge that the covenants set forth in this Section 8.5
are an essential 
element of this Agreement and that, but for these covenants, the Parties would
not have entered into this Agreement. The Parties to this Agreement
acknowledge that this Section 8.5 constitutes an independent covenant and
shall not be affected by performance or nonperformance of any other provision
of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement by the Parties.

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the type and periods of restriction imposed
in the 
provisions of this Section 8.5 are fair and reasonable and are reasonably
required for the protection of the Parties. If any of the restrictions or
covenants in this Section 8.5 are hereafter construed to be invalid or
unenforceable, the same shall not affect the remainder of the covenant or
covenants, which shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalid
portions. If any of the restrictions or covenants contained in this Section
8.5, or any portion thereof, are deemed to be unenforceable because such
covenant or restriction is held to cover a geographic area or to be of such
duration as is not permitted under Applicable Law, the Parties agree that the
court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the duration
and/or areas of such provision and, in its reduced form, said provision shall
then be enforceable.

(e) Each Party recognizes that its obligations under this Section 8.5 are
special, unique and 
extraordinary in character and that, in the event of any actual violation of
any provision of this Section 8.5, the other Party shall be entitled to
institute and prosecute proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction,
either in law or in equity, to obtain damages for any actual violation,
enforce the specific performance and/or enjoin any actions in violation of
this Section 8.5.

under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate.

Affiliates and 
each of its and their respective Representatives to hold in confidence, and
not use for any purpose other than as contemplated by this Agreement

information received from Seller, its Affiliates or Seller's Representatives
in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (excluding
the Business Records transferred pursuant to Section 8.10(a), but including
any records comingled with such records that should not have transferred
pursuant to Section 8.10(a)), other than as required by Applicable Law.

(c) From and after the Closing Date and until the time of any recapture under
the 
Reinsurance Agreements, Seller shall hold, and shall cause its Affiliates and
each of its and their respective Representatives to hold in confidence, and
not use for any purpose other than as contemplated by this Agreement
(including Section 8.10(b)) or any Ancillary Agreement, any confidential
information received from Buyer, its Affiliates or Seller's Representatives in
connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or contained in
the Business Records transferred pursuant to Section 8.10(a), other than as
required by Applicable Law. To the extent any Business Record is an Acquired
Asset, Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives shall
hold such Business Record in confidence and shall not use such Business Record
in a Competing Business after the Closing Date.

Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
in all respects in accordance with its terms.

to, do all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law as
reasonably requested by Buyer to put Buyer in effective possession, ownership
and control of the Acquired Assets, and Buyer shall cooperate with Seller for
such purpose, and (b) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, do all
things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law as reasonably

Transferred Contract to Buyer, and Seller shall cooperate with Buyer for such
purposes; provided, that, except as provided in Section 7.4 or Section 7.5,

Closing) is used or held for use to conduct the Business as of June 30, 2012
and such asset, property or right is reasonably required or necessary for the
conduct by Buyer and its Affiliates after the Closing of the Business as
conducted as of June 30, 2012 by Seller and its Affiliates, Seller shall make
the benefits of such asset, property or right available to Buyer and its
Affiliates, pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement or pursuant to an
alternative arrangement for a period of two years commencing on the Closing
Date.

or to be possessed by such Person or to which such Person has access rights
(including, in the case of Seller and its Affiliates, all Business Records not
transferred to Buyer as provided in Section 8.10(a)). During such period, upon
any reasonable request from a Party or its Representatives, the Party holding
such records shall (a) provide to the requesting Party, its Affiliates or its
authorized Representatives reasonable access to such records during normal
business hours; provided, that such access shall not unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of the business of the Party holding such records, and (b)
permit the requesting Party or its Representatives to make copies of such
records, in each case, at no cost to the requesting Party or its
Representatives (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses). Nothing
herein shall require either Party to disclose any information to the other if
such disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, the work
product immunity or any other legal privilege or similar doctrine or
contravene any Applicable Law, Court Order, Regulatory Agreement or agreement
(including any confidentiality agreement to which the disclosing Party or any
of its Affiliates is a party) (it being understood that the disclosing Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain waivers or make other
arrangements (including redacting information or entering into joint defense

Party or its Representatives to occur without so jeopardizing privilege or
contravening such Applicable Law, Court Order, Contract, duty or agreement) or

Tax records or any personnel or related records. Such records may be sought
under this Section 8.10 for any reasonable purpose, including to the extent
reasonably required in connection with accounting, litigation, federal
securities disclosure or other similar purpose (other than for purposes
relating to claims between Seller and Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any and all such records may be destroyed by a Party if such
destroying party sends to the other Party hereto written notice of its intent
to destroy such records, specifying in 













reasonable detail the contents of the records to be destroyed; such records
may then be destroyed after the sixtieth (60th) day following such notice
unless the other Party notifies the destroying Party that such other Party
desires to obtain possession of such records, in which event the destroying
Party shall transfer the records to such requesting Party and such requesting
Party shall pay all reasonable expenses of the destroying Party in connection
therewith.

Section 8.11 Reserved.

instrument to Buyer.

Section 8.13 Existing Reinsurance Agreements

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the applicable Cedants to
terminate the Existing 
Reinsurance Agreements set forth on Section 8.13(a) of the Business Disclosure
Schedule and to recapture in full the liabilities ceded thereunder in respect
of such business. Seller shall bear all costs and expenses with respect to the
termination and recapture of the Existing Reinsurance Agreements set forth on
Section 8.13(a) of the Business Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Prior to Closing, Seller shall use Consent Efforts to obtain the Third-
Party Consents listed 
on Section 8.13(b) of the Business Disclosure Schedule. Seller shall bear all
costs and expenses with respect to the termination and recapture of the
Existing Reinsurance Agreements set forth on Section 8.13(b) of the Business
Disclosure Schedule.

(c) Seller shall use Consent Efforts, with Buyer's cooperation, to cause the
applicable Cedant 
to novate and assign all of its rights and obligations under the Existing
Reinsurance Agreements listed in Section 8.13(c) of the Business Disclosure
Schedule to which such Cedant is a party to Reinsurer by June 30, 2013 and to
obtain any endorsements from the reinsurers or Underlying Companies
thereunder, as applicable, to the extent necessary to ensure that Reinsurer is
entitled to enforce such Existing Reinsurance Agreements against the
reinsurers or Underlying Companies thereunder, as applicable, in its own name.
The first $400,000 of aggregate administrative or similar costs and attorney's
or other advisors' fees associated with obtaining the Third-Party Consents
required for such novations shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and
fifty percent (50%) by Seller and any other costs and expenses in excess of
$400,000 shall be borne exclusively by Seller, it being understood that
neither Party shall be required to expend any amount in order to obtain any
such Third-Party Consent in excess of such Party's share of such costs as
described in this Section 8.13(c).

(d) Prior to Closing, the Parties shall use their Consent Efforts to obtain
any Third-Party 
Consents, including any waivers of minimum retention requirements, that are
required under Existing Reinsurance Agreements (or any ancillary agreements
related thereto) in order to permit the reinsurance of the Covered Insurance
Policies as contemplated by the Reinsurance Agreements. Seller shall bear all
costs and expenses associated with obtaining the Third-Party Consents required
by this Section 8.13(d). If in connection with seeking any such Third-Party
Consents, any Existing Reinsurance Agreement is terminated or recaptured not
at the direction or with the consent of Buyer or its Affiliates, then Buyer
and its Affiliates shall not be responsible for any related termination fees,
recapture fees or any similar fees arising from the termination or recapture
of any such Existing Reinsurance Agreement. If the Parties 













reasonably determine that a Third-Party Consent required to be obtained under
this Section 8.13(d) is not likely to be obtained, then the Parties will
negotiate in good faith the proposed treatment of the relevant Existing
Reinsurance Agreement, including the possibility of terminating, recapturing
or novating the same; provided, that Buyer shall not be required to accept any
alternative arrangement that adversely affects the benefits reasonably
expected to be derived by Buyer from such Existing Reinsurance Agreement.

delete such instances of the Software as soon as practicable.

Section 8.16 Residual Information.

(a) Notwithstanding the confidentiality obligations set forth in Section 8.6
or anything

Date (a) Seller and its Affiliates may use, and Buyer hereby grants and shall
cause its Affiliates to grant to Seller and its Affiliates a license to use,
in their businesses for any and all purposes the Trade Secrets and other
ideas, know-how, techniques and confidential information included in the
Transferred Owned Intellectual Property and (b) Buyer and its Affiliates may
use, and Seller hereby grants and shall cause its Affiliates to grant to Buyer
and its Affiliates a license to use, in their business for any and all
purposes the Trade Secrets and other ideas, know-how, technique and
confidential information of Seller and its Affiliates that, in the case of
each of (a) and (b), are retained in the unaided memories (i.e., without
conscious memorization or subsequent reference to any material which is
written or stored in electronic or physical form) of personnel of Seller and
its Affiliates and of any Transferred Employees, respectively (the "Residual
Information") who have had access to the Residual Information prior to the
Closing Date; provided, that no license is hereby granted to Seller and its
Affiliates to any Patents or Copyrights included in the Transferred Owned
Intellectual Property and no license is hereby granted to Buyer and its
Affiliates, except as set forth above, to any Intellectual Property Rights of
Seller and its Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and its

Buyer and its Affiliates respectively.

(b) Seller hereby grants and causes its Affiliates to grant to Buyer, and
Buyer hereby 
accepts, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual right and license to use,
solely in connection with the Business, all Copyrights, Patents, Trade Secrets
and Software owned by Seller or one of its Affiliates and used by the Business
that is not an Acquired Asset and that is not otherwise licensed to Buyer
pursuant to an Ancillary Agreement. Buyer may not assign, directly,
indirectly, or by operation of law, the rights under this Section 8.16(b),
without prior written consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except that Buyer may assign or sublicense
its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without Seller's
consent, to (a) any of its Affiliates or (b) any acquirer (each, an
"Acquirer") of any divested (by asset sale, stock sale, merger, spin-off or
otherwise) business of Buyer (each, a "Divested Business"); provided, that,
with respect to the assignment or sublicense to an Acquirer: (i) the
assignment or sublicense will only be for the field of the activities of the
applicable Divested Business as they exist as of the date of such Acquirer's
acquisition of the Divested Business, and any natural extensions thereof, but
in no event outside the Business; and (ii) the assignment or

Affiliates discover (i) any binders, endorsements, riders, policies,
certificates, or contracts of individual life insurance, or supplementary
contracts of individual life insurance issued, renewed or assumed by any
Cedant that would have been a Covered Insurance Policy but for not having been
reflected or otherwise taken into account in the Closing Statement of General
Account Net Settlement ("Discovered Policies"), then the Parties will
negotiate in good faith either to have Buyer or its Affiliates acquire such
Discovered Policies in a reinsurance transaction or administer such Discovered
Policies on Seller's or its Affiliate's behalf; it being agreed and
acknowledged that Buyer will not unreasonably refuse to assume (or cause an
Affiliate to assume) the administration of any Discovered Policies on
commercially reasonable terms.

Section 8.18 Investment Assets with a Payment Default. At least ten (10)
Business

Days prior to Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a list of any of the
Investment Assets and Modco Assets that had suffered an uncured default of
payment of principal or interest or dividends as of the last day of the
calendar month immediately preceding the month in which the Closing Date
occurs (or, in the event that the Closing Date is January 2, 2013, as of
November 30, 2012). In such event, Seller shall replace prior to Closing any
of such Investment Assets or Modco Assets with other assets meeting the
requirements of the Investment Guidelines (and that is not then subject to an
uncured default of payment of principal or interest or dividends). Within
thirty (30) Business Days following the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer
a list of any of the Investment Assets or Modco Assets included in the
Estimated Eligible Asset list (or, in the case of the Modco Assets, retained
by the Cedant) that had suffered an uncured default of payment of principal or
interest or dividends as of the Effective Time. In such event, Seller shall,
at Buyer's request made within ten (10) Business Days of the delivery of such
list, replace any of such Investment Assets or Modco Assets with other assets
meeting the requirements of the Investment Guidelines (and that is not then
subject to an uncured default of payment of principal or interest or
dividends) having an equal aggregate Statutory Book Value and, in the case of
the replacement of Investment Assets, amend the Estimated Eligible Asset list
with such replacement.

Section 8.19 AG-38 Cooperation. In the event that the application of
guidelines or

regulations under Section 8D of AG-38 to the Business or a change in such
guidelines or regulations results in additional statutory reserves in excess
of the basic and deficiency reserves, in each case, calculated as of the
Closing Date determined by Seller according to the reserve methodology and
assumptions used by Seller for the statutorily-reported reserve for the
Business assuming the application of AG-38 as of December 31, 2011 (as such
guidelines or regulations were in effect as of such time), Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for the after-tax net economic impact on Buyer and its
Affiliates of such additional reserves (treating such increase as non-economic
reserves for the purposes of determining such impact) (the "AG-38 Cost");
provided, however, that to the extent the increase in statutory reserves
results from a change in the guidelines or regulations under Section 8D of
AG-38 from the proposed guidelines or regulations existing as of the date
hereof, Seller shall only be responsible for fifty percent (50%) of the AG-38
Cost. Buyer and Seller shall jointly work in good faith to determine the AG-38
Cost.

Section 8.20 Specified Action. The Parties agree that the Specified Action
shall be handled

as provided in Section 8.20 of the Business Disclosure Schedule.

Retrocession Agreement, 
Buyer and Seller shall cause their respective Affiliates that are parties to
the Group Conversion 
Retrocession Agreement to set revised rates using a methodology that
replicates the net economics (i.e 













breakeven to the retrocedent) reflected in Schedule 8.21 of the Business
Disclosure Schedule based on the Group Conversion Policies' actual experience
as measured by the prior annual period.

to Buyer, under Section 11.1(b)(i):

(A) for any claim (or series of related claims arising from the same
underlying facts, events or circumstances) where the Losses relating thereto
are less than $50,000 (it being understood that Losses relating to such claim
(or series of related claims arising from the same underlying facts, events or

following clause (B));

(B) unless the aggregate of all Losses for which, but for this clause (B),
Seller would be liable under Section 11.1(a)(i) or Buyer would be liable under

(iii) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in
the

event that any fact, event or circumstance results in payment to Reinsurer of

received by Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller or any Seller
Indemnified Person, as the case may be, with respect to such Loss (calculated
net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
collecting such amount; provided, that, subject to Section 8.2, nothing in
this Section 11.1(c)(iv) shall obligate either Party to maintain any
insurance); (B) the net amount of any indemnity payment, contribution or other
similar payment Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified 













Person or Seller or any Seller Indemnified Person, as the case may be,
actually received from any third party not affiliated with such Indemnified
Party with respect to such Loss; and (C) an amount equal to the net amount of
any reduction of Taxes attributable to such Loss that is actually realized by
the Indemnified Party (or, in the case of consolidated, combined or unitary
Taxes, by the Affiliated Group of which the Indemnified Party is a member) in
the taxable year in which the Loss is incurred. Each Loss shall be increased
by the net amount of any increase of Taxes attributable to the receipt of any
indemnification payment with respect to such Loss (including Taxes
attributable to the increase in the indemnification payment pursuant to this
sentence) that is actually incurred by the Indemnified Party (or, in the case
of consolidated, combined or unitary Taxes, by the Affiliated Group of which
the Indemnified Party is a member) in the taxable year in which the payment is
received or accrued.

(d) In connection with the indemnity in Section 11.1(a)(iv) with respect to
microfiche, Seller 
shall have the right to remediate the Business Records on Seller's premises at
its expense and in a manner that does not materially interfere with Buyer's
use and deliver such Business Records to Buyer following such remediation.

(e) Except as expressly provided herein, this Section 11.1 shall not apply
with respect to 
indemnification for Losses relating to Taxes or the Product Tax IT and
Administration, which shall be subject to indemnification in accordance with
Article XII.

Section 11.2 Notice of Claim; Defense.

(a) If (i) any non-affiliated third party or Governmental Body institutes or
asserts any Action that may give rise to Losses for which a Party (an
"Indemnifying Party") may be liable for indemnification under this Article XI
(a "Third-Party Claim") or (ii) any Person that may be entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") desires to make
a claim not involving a Third-Party Claim to be indemnified by an Indemnifying
Party, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly send to the Indemnifying
Party a written notice specifying the nature of such claim and a good faith
estimate of the amount of all related Losses to the extent they are
ascertainable (a "Claim Notice"). The Indemnifying Party shall not be relieved
from any of its indemnification obligations under this Article XI as a result
of a failure of the Indemnified Party to provide a Claim Notice except to the
extent that it is prejudiced by such failure, it being understood that Claim
Notices in respect of a breach of a representation or warranty must be
delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period specified
in Section 11.1(c)(i) for such representation or warranty; provided, that if,
prior to such applicable date, the Indemnified Party shall have notified the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with the requirements of this Section 11.2(a)
of a claim for indemnification under this Article XI (whether or not formal
legal action shall have been commenced based upon such claim), such claim
shall continue to be subject to indemnification in accordance with this
Article XI notwithstanding the passing of such applicable date.

(b) The Indemnifying Party may, by notice delivered within twenty (20)
Business Days of the receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to a Third-Party
Claim, assume the defense and control of such Third-Party Claim (at the
expense of such Indemnifying Party). The Indemnified Party may take any
actions reasonably necessary to defend any Third-Party Claim prior to the time
that it receives notice from the Indemnifying Party as contemplated by the
preceding sentence. The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or
maintain control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim and shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if
(i) the Third-Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation against the
Indemnified Party or (ii) the Third-Party Claim would reasonably be expected
to result in an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party
or the Business that would, in each 













case, have a material effect on the operation of the business of such
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or the operation of the Business.

(c) Subject to Section 11.2(b), in the event of a Third-Party Claim, if the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may elect to retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Parties to represent such Indemnified Parties in connection with
such Action and shall pay the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel.
Subject to Section 11.2(b), if the Indemnifying Party so elects, the
Indemnified Parties may participate, at their own expense and through legal
counsel of their choice, in any such Action; provided, that (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of the Indemnified Parties in
connection with such Action and (ii) the Indemnified Parties and their counsel
shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in
connection with such Action. To the extent such action can be taken in a way
that does not unreasonably jeopardize the attorney-client privilege: (i) the
Indemnified Party's right to participate in the defense of any Action shall
include the right to attend all significant internal meetings, all meetings
with representatives of plaintiffs, hearings and the like; and (ii) counsel
for a Indemnified Party also shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
comment upon all memoranda of law, pleadings and briefs and other documents
relating to the Third-Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
shall give reasonable consideration to the comments of counsel for the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Action
without the relevant Indemnified Parties' prior written consent, unless the
terms of such settlement (A) provide for no relief other than the payment of
monetary damages and do not result in a material increase to the cost of
administering the Business under any of the Administrative Services Agreements
for which Buyer or its Affiliate does not get compensated, (B) involve no
finding or admission of any breach or violation by any Indemnified Party and
(C) include an express unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from
all Liability arising from such Action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Indemnifying Party does not promptly retain counsel and assume control of such
defense, then the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnifying Party in connection with such Action and assume control of
the defense in connection with such Action. Under no circumstances will the
Indemnifying Party have any liability in connection with any settlement of any
Action that is entered into without its prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(d) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice involving a Third-Party
Claim, at the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified
Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its counsel, experts and
Representatives full access, during normal business hours, to the books,
records, personnel and properties of the Indemnified Party to the extent
reasonably related to such Claim Notice at no cost to the Indemnifying Party
(other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Parties).

(e) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a Claim Notice from an
Indemnified Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall notify the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days
following its receipt of such notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes
its liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article XI.

(f) If there shall be any conflicts between the provisions of this Section
11.2 and Section 12.2(b) (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of Section
12.2(b) shall control with respect to Tax contests.

Section 11.3 No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy.

(a) Any Liability for indemnification hereunder and under any Ancillary
Agreement shall be

determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the same Loss. 













(b) Prior to the Closing, other than in the case of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by 
Seller or any of its Affiliates, the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer for
any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement or any certificate or instrument delivered hereunder shall be
refusal to close the transactions contemplated hereunder in accordance with
Sections 9.1(a) or (b) and termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article XIII.

(c) Except with respect to claims alleging fraud and as provided under (i) the
provisions of 
Sections 2.4 through 2.5, (ii) the provisions of Article XII (relating to Tax
matters), (iii) the provisions hereof providing for equitable remedies or (iv)
the provisions of any Ancillary Agreement (other than the Bill of Sale and the
Assignment and Assumption Agreement), from and after the Closing, the
exclusive remedy of Seller, the Seller Indemnified Persons, Buyer and the
Buyer Indemnified Persons in connection with this Agreement (and any
certificate or instrument delivered hereunder) and the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether under this Agreement or arising under Applicable
Law) shall be as provided in this Article XI. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each of Buyer, on behalf of itself and each other Buyer Indemnified Person,
and Seller, on behalf of itself and each other Seller Indemnified Person,
hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other
than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) it may have against
Seller or any of its Affiliates or Representatives and Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives, as the case may be, arising under or based upon
this Agreement, any certificate or instrument delivered in connection
herewith, the Bill of Sale or the Assignment and Assumption Agreement (whether
under this Agreement or arising under common law or any other Applicable Law),
except (x) pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article XI or (y) as provided under (A) the provisions of Sections 2.4 through
2.5, (B) the provisions of Article XII (relating to Tax matters), (C) the
provisions hereof providing for equitable remedies or (D) the provisions of
any Ancillary Agreement (other than the Bill of Sale and the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement).

Section 11.4 Limitation on Set-off. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any
right to

set off any unresolved indemnification claim pursuant to this Article XI
against any payment due pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement.

Section 11.5 Mitigation. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other with

respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one Party is
obligated to indemnify the other Party under this Article XI, including by
making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such claim or liability, to
the extent required by Applicable Law.

Section 11.6 Recovery by Indemnified Party.

(a) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third party not
affiliated with such Indemnified Party any amount in respect of any Loss for
which an Indemnifying Party has actually reimbursed it pursuant to this
Article XI, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying
Party the amount so recovered (net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount), but not in excess of the
sum of (i) any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim and (ii) any amount
expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim arising
out of such matter.

(b) If any portion of Losses to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Article XI could be recovered from a third party not
affiliated with the relevant Indemnified Party (including under any applicable
third-party insurance coverage) based on the underlying claim or demand
asserted against such Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall
promptly give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party and, upon the request
of the Indemnifying Party, shall use commercially 













reasonable efforts to collect the maximum amount recoverable from such third
party, in which event the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified
Party for all reasonable costs incurred in connection with such collection. If
any portion of Losses actually paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Article XI could have been recovered from a third party not affiliated with
the relevant Indemnified Party (including under any applicable third-party
insurance coverage) based on the underlying claim or demand asserted against
such Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall transfer, to the
extent transferable, such of its rights to proceed against such third party as
are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from such third
party any amount actually paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Article XI.

Section 11.7 Reserves. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this

Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
makes any representation or warranty with respect to, and nothing contained in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement is intended or shall be construed to
be a representation or warranty (express or implied) of Seller or any of its
Affiliates with respect to the adequacy or sufficiency of any of the Reserves
with respect to the Business, except as provided in Section 5.6(i).

Section 11.8 Reservation of Rights. Any Indemnified Party shall be an intended
third

party beneficiary of the indemnification obligations of Buyer and Seller,
respectively, in this Article XI. 
Neither Buyer's nor Seller's right to indemnity pursuant to this Article XI
shall be adversely affected by

(i) any investigation conducted by or on behalf of such party or by any
Knowledge of Buyer or by any Knowledge of Seller, as applicable, acquired by
or on behalf of such party as a result of such investigation or otherwise, in
each case, whether before or after the date of this Agreement or the Closing
Date, or

(ii) its waiver of a condition to Closing set forth in Article IX or Article
X.

ARTICLE XII 
TAX MATTERS

Section 12.1 Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes imposed by any Tax Authority
in

connection with this Agreement and any other transactions contemplated hereby
shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller.
Notwithstanding Section 12.2, which shall not apply to Tax Returns relating to
Transfer Taxes, any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer
Taxes shall be prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or
customarily responsible under Applicable Law for filing such Tax Returns, and
such party shall provide such Tax Returns to the other party at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to be filed. If
either party is liable under Applicable Law for payment of such Transfer
Taxes, the other party shall pay the amount of its portion of such Transfer
Tax to the paying party no later than seven (7) Business Days after receipt of
a request for payment from the paying party. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate
in the timely completion and filing of all such Tax Returns. Buyer and Seller
shall reasonably cooperate to reduce or eliminate such Transfer Taxes to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law.

Section 12.2 Tax Returns and Covenants.

(a) Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
Straddle Tax Returns

required to be filed with respect to the Business or the Acquired Assets and
pay the Taxes shown to be due thereon; provided, that Seller shall promptly
reimburse Buyer for the portion of such Tax that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period. Seller will furnish to Buyer all information and records reasonably
requested by Buyer for use in preparation of any Straddle Tax Returns. Buyer
shall allow Seller to review, comment upon and reasonably approve without
undue delay any Straddle Tax Return at least ten 













(10) Business Days before the filing of such Tax Return, provided, that Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Return to Seller
at least fifteen (15) Business Days before such filing.

(b) In the case of any Straddle Period, (i) real, personal, intangible
property, or other property Taxes ("Property Taxes") with respect to the
Acquired Assets for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of
such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that
are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the Straddle Period, and (ii) all other Taxes, if any, shall be
apportioned on the basis of a closing of the books as of the close of business
on the Closing Date.

(c) Seller and Buyer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and
their representatives, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance (including access to the Product Tax IT and
Administration and related personnel) relating to the Covered Insurance
Policies or the Acquired Assets or the preparation of any Straddle Period Tax
Returns applicable to the Business or the Acquired Assets (including access to
books and records as well as the timely provision of powers of attorney or
similar authorizations) as is reasonably necessary for the preparation and
filing of all Tax Returns (including any disclosures under Section 6011 or
6111 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations thereunder), the making of any
election related to Taxes, the identification and remediation of any Losses or
potential Losses for which Seller would be liable pursuant to Section 12.4(a)
or Section 12.6(a), the preparation for any audit or other Action related to
Taxes, and the prosecution or defense of any audit, proposed adjustment or
deficiency, assessment, claim, suit or other proceeding relating to any Taxes,
Tax Return, Product Tax Claim or Related Claim. Seller and Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any of the matters,
actions, or proceedings described in the preceding sentence. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing herein shall require either party to provide the other party
access to any federal, state or local consolidated income Tax Return that
includes the first such party or its Affiliates. Any information obtained
under this Section 12.2(c) shall be kept confidential, except as otherwise
reasonably may be necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or
claims for refund or in conducting any Tax audit, dispute or contest.

(d) (i) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt by Buyer,
any of its Affiliates of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state,
local or foreign Tax audits or assessments relating to any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period or relating to a
Tax for which Seller may be liable pursuant to this Agreement, provided, that
Buyer's failure to so notify Seller shall not relieve Seller from liability
pursuant to this Article XII except to the extent Seller is materially
prejudiced as a consequence of such failure.

(ii) Subject to Section 12.6, Seller shall have the sole right to control the
conduct of

any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to the Business
or the Acquired Assets for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date or any Straddle Period with respect to a Tax for which Seller may be
liable pursuant to this Agreement, and to employ counsel of Seller's choice at
Seller's expense; provided that Seller agrees, in advance of assuming such
control, that it will indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons for the Losses
or liabilities resulting therefrom as provided in Section 12.4; provided
further, that Buyer and its Representatives shall be permitted, at Buyer's
expense, to be present at, and participate in, any such audit or proceeding.
Notwithstanding such control, Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Affiliates to, settle, either administratively or after the commencement
of litigation, any claim for Taxes in connection with any such audit or other
proceeding in a manner that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the liability for Taxes of Buyer or its Affiliates without the express written
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or 













delayed. Buyer shall control all other Tax audits or administrative or court
proceedings relating to the Business. Subject to such control, neither Buyer
nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall be entitled to settle, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes
that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the liability for Taxes
relating to a Tax for which Seller would be liable, in whole or in part,
pursuant to this Agreement (including an Excluded Liability) without the prior
written consent of Seller, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or
delayed. Seller may discharge at any time its indemnification obligation under
Section 12.4(a) by paying Buyer the amount payable pursuant to Section
12.4(a), calculated on the date of such payment.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, Sections 12.2(a) - (d) shall not apply to
Taxes due in respect 
of Premiums (as defined in the Reinsurance Agreements) or Tax Returns relating
to such Taxes, in each case which shall be governed exclusively by the
Ancillary Agreements.

Section 12.3 Tax Characterizations of Adjustments. To the extent permitted by

Applicable Law, Seller and Buyer agree to treat, and cause their respective
Affiliates to treat, all payments made either to or for the benefit of the
other under any indemnity provisions of this Agreement and for any
misrepresentations or breach of warranty or covenants as adjustments to the
Tax Purchase Price for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for
purposes hereof.

Section 12.4 Tax Indemnification and Parties' Responsibility.

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article XII, 
except to the extent such Losses (i) are subject to indemnification by Buyer
pursuant to Section 12.4(b) or (ii) result from a breach by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates of the terms of any Ancillary Agreement, Seller is and shall
remain solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Buyer Indemnified Person from and against all Losses attributable to (x) all
Taxes that constitute Excluded Liabilities (or the non-payment thereof) or (y)
any breach by Seller or its Affiliates of any covenant under Section
7.1(a)(xiii) or this Article XII or any representation or warranty under
Section 5.6 (other than Section 5.6(i)) or Section 5.19(e)-(n), except to the
extent that such representations or warranties relate to the Product Tax IT
and Administration.

(b) Except to the extent such Losses are subject to indemnification by Seller,
Buyer shall 
be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller
Indemnified Person from and against all Losses attributable to (i) all Taxes
imposed on or with respect to the Acquired Assets or the Business, as
applicable (A) for taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date and (B)
with respect to Straddle Periods, for the portion of such Taxes allocable to
the period after the Closing Date (as determined under Section 12.2(c)), in
each case, except to the extent such Taxes are subject to indemnity by Seller
pursuant to this Article XII, and (ii) all Taxes imposed on or with respect to
Seller or its Affiliates, the Acquired Assets or the Business, arising from or
relating to any breach by Buyer or its Affiliates of any covenant under this
Article XII.

(c) The indemnities provided for in Section 12.4(a) and Section 12.4(b) shall
survive 
until thirty (30) days following the expiry of the applicable statute of
limitations in respect of the Taxes subject to indemnification as provided
herein.

(d) Any Liability for indemnification hereunder and under any Ancillary
Agreement 
shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the same
Loss. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one Party is obligated
to indemnify the other Party under this Article XII, including by making
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such claim or liability. Except to
the extent that representations, warranties 













and covenants in this Agreement other than those described in Section 12.4(a)
expressly relate to Taxes, the sole remedy of Buyer, its Affiliates or the
Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Agreement for any claim against Seller or
its Affiliates with respect to any Losses attributable to Taxes or Product Tax
Non-Compliance shall be as provided in this Article XII.

Section 12.5 Tax Refunds. Seller shall retain the right to any Tax refunds or
credits

that are attributable to the Business in respect of Pre-Closing Tax Periods
(or portions thereof) and that are actually received by Buyer, Seller or its
Affiliates (or otherwise credited against tax).

Section 12.6 Indemnification for Product Tax Non-Compliance.

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to Section 12.6(e)-(g), except to the
extent such 
Losses (i) result from a breach by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of the terms
of any Ancillary Agreement or (ii) are attributable to (A) a modification
completed, or other action taken by Buyer, that changes the Product Tax IT and
Administration after the Closing Date, other than a modification or other
action taken by Buyer after the Closing Date in accordance with Section
12.6(a) of the Business Disclosure Schedule as of Closing (or Seller's written
procedures attached thereto as of the Closing), (B) a failure to follow the
Product Tax IT Workarounds, (C) a failure to promptly notify Seller pursuant
to Section 12.6(c) or otherwise to satisfy the notice requirements of Section
12.6(c) (provided in each case that such failure shall not relieve Seller from
liability pursuant to this Section 12.6 except to the extent Seller is
prejudiced as a consequence of such failure), or (D) a change in Applicable
Law (or a Tax Authority's written interpretation thereof) after the Closing
Date, Seller is and shall remain solely responsible for, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless each Buyer Indemnified Person from and against all Losses
attributable to any Product Tax Non-Compliance arising (x) at or before the
Closing or (y) during the Post-Closing Three-Year Period to the extent
attributable to Buyer's reliance on the Policy Forms or design of the Covered
Insurance Policies or on the Product Tax IT and Administration. For the
avoidance of doubt, subject to the preceding sentence and Section 12.6(e)-(g),
Seller shall indemnify each Buyer Indemnified Person for any reasonable and
necessary costs, including the costs of implementing appropriate manual
workarounds (which costs shall include a reasonable allocation of employee
compensation), to ensure that the administration of the Covered Insurance
Policies is in accordance with the Product Tax Law Rules, as well as other
costs of remediation (including costs incurred in connection with obtaining
remediation or other corrective relief from the IRS), and any Losses
attributable to Related Claims.

(b) Disclosure in the Business Disclosure Schedule, or otherwise before the
Closing, of 
known Product Tax Non-Compliance or measures that are planned or recommended
to address Product Tax Non-Compliance but have not been implemented prior to
the Closing at Seller's expense, shall not affect Seller's indemnification
obligations hereunder.

(c) Buyer shall promptly provide written notice to Seller of each claim of
Product Tax Nonâ€‘ 
Compliance (a "Product Tax Claim", and such notice, a "Product Tax Claim
Notice") that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 12.6, after the facts or
circumstances providing the basis for such Product Tax Claim become known to
Buyer (but, in any event, promptly after receipt of any notice of a Related
Claim). A Product Tax Claim Notice shall contain (i) a summary of the facts
(set forth with reasonable specificity) underlying or relating to the Product
Tax Claim, (ii) any correspondence, notice or other communication received
from any nonaffiliated Third Party with respect to the Product Tax Claim, and
(iii) a statement that Buyer seeks indemnification for a Loss arising from the
Product Tax Claim and the basis therefor.

(d) Defense of Related Claims. 













(i) Seller and Buyer shall jointly control the defense and resolution of any
Related Claim, provided that either Party may solely control such defense and
resolution at its own expense by, within thirty (30) days after Seller's
receipt of the related Product Tax Claim Notice, providing to the other Party
written notice of its agreement that, with respect to any Losses resulting
from the resolution of such Related Claim, (A) in the case of Seller, it will
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons as provided in this Section 12.6, and
(B) in the case of Buyer, Seller shall not have an obligation to indemnify the
Buyer Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Section 12.6. If the Parties
jointly control such defense and resolution, then (X) each Party shall
participate in such defense and resolution at its own expense, and (Y) neither
Party shall consent to the entry of judgment or admit any liability with
respect to or settle, compromise, discharge, or otherwise resolve any Related
Claim without the other Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The remediation of any
Product Tax Non-Compliance related to a Related Claim shall be controlled as
provided in Section 12.6(f).

(ii) To the extent a Party is not controlling the defense and resolution of a
Related Claim pursuant to Section 12.6(d)(i), such Party shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to participate in the defense and resolution of any
Related Claim at its own expense and to employ counsel separate from the
counsel employed by the other Party at the first Party's own expense. The
Parties shall cooperate in the defense and resolution of any Related Claim,
provided that such cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of either Party.

(iii) Upon a settlement, compromise, or other resolution of any Related Claim
(a "Related Claim Resolution") that causes Seller to have an indemnification
obligation under Section 12.6(a), Seller shall pay (A) all indemnified amounts
due to the relevant non-affiliated Third Party or Governmental Body as a
result of such Related Claim Resolution within the time set forth under such
Related Claim Resolution and (B) all other amounts (if any) for which Seller
is required to indemnify Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to Section 12.6(a)
with respect to such Related Claim Resolution as such amounts are paid by
Buyer; provided that, in respect of any amount paid by Buyer described in
clause (B), Buyer shall promptly provide Seller with written notice that, and
information reasonably sufficient to verify that, such payment has been made
by Buyer.

(e) Buyer Claims. During the Post-Closing Three-Year Period, a Buyer Claim may
be 
brought by Buyer. Upon the expiration of the Post-Closing Three-Year Period,
Buyer shall no longer have the right to bring, assert, claim, or otherwise
pursue any Buyer Claim other than any Buyer Claim with respect to which the
Product Tax Claim Notice was delivered prior to the expiration of the Post-
Closing Three-Year Period. For the avoidance of doubt, the Product Tax Claim
Notice referred to in the preceding sentence must describe the Buyer Claim in
accordance with the notice requirements of Sections 12.6(c)(i) and (iii) in
order for Buyer to have the right to bring, assert, claim, or otherwise pursue
such Buyer Claim following the expiration of the Post-Closing Three-Year
Period.

(f) Remediation of Product Tax Non-Compliance.

(i) With respect to any Product Tax Claim (including any Buyer Claim), Buyer

and Seller shall cooperate to determine whether there has been Product Tax
Non-Compliance, and, if necessary, to develop corrective measures that are
reasonable and cost effective, taking into account all of the relevant facts
and circumstances then applicable (including, without limitation, obtaining
remediation or other corrective relief from the IRS), in order to remediate
such Product Tax Non-Compliance. 













(ii) If Seller and Buyer agree that Product Tax Non-Compliance has occurred,
and agree with respect to the appropriate corrective measures, Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate to implement such corrective measures as provided in
Section 12.6(f)(v) and Section 12.6(f)(vi).

(iii) If Seller and Buyer cannot agree (A) whether Product Tax Non-Compliance
has occurred, or (B) with respect to the appropriate corrective measures, the
dispute may be submitted to the Accounting Firm for arbitration at Buyer's
option, provided that Buyer may also opt to submit multiple disputes to the
Accounting Firm for arbitration simultaneously at the end of a calendar year
or at such time mutually agreed to in writing by Buyer and Seller, in which
case Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of its intent to do so. In the event
that a dispute has been submitted to the Accounting Firm for arbitration,
Seller and Buyer shall deliver to the Accounting Firm copies of any schedules,
documentation, or other materials that may reasonably be required by the
Accounting Firm to make its determination. The Accounting Firm will be
required to determine whether Product Tax Non-Compliance has occurred (if in
dispute) and to select either the corrective measures proposed by Seller or
the corrective measures proposed by Buyer, based on which proposed corrective
measures are more appropriate, reasonable, and cost effective under all of the
relevant facts and circumstances then applicable. The Accounting Firm shall
render a determination within sixty (60) days of the referral of such matter
for resolution. The determinations of the Accounting Firm shall be final and
binding on all Parties for all purposes of this Agreement. Arbitration costs
will be shared equally by Seller and Buyer.

(iv) Seller shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons for corrective
measures attributable to a Product Tax Claim, subject to the cost-sharing
provisions of Section 12.6(g), only to the extent that such corrective
measures were agreed to by Seller and Buyer or were selected by the Accounting
Firm, as applicable, as described in Section 12.6(f)(ii) or Section
12.6(f)(iii), respectively, provided, that if, with respect to any Product Tax
Claim, Seller disagrees with Buyer that Product Tax Non-Compliance has
occurred and Buyer chooses not to arbitrate, or, following arbitration, the
Accounting Firm determines that no Product Tax Non-Compliance has occurred,
and, as a result of a Related Claim based on the same alleged Product Tax Non-
Compliance that gave rise to the Product Tax Claim, there is a Final
Determination that Product Tax Non-Compliance has occurred, then Seller shall
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons in accordance with the provisions of
Section 12.6 for the reasonable and necessary costs associated with the
corrective measures undertaken to remediate such Product Tax Non-Compliance.

(v) If the corrective measures described in this Section 12.6(f) include
obtaining remediation or other corrective relief from the IRS, Buyer and
Seller shall jointly participate in all discussions or other proceedings with
the IRS, including attendance at meetings and joint approval of all written
submissions. Seller shall control the decision of whether or not to enter into
a closing agreement or other arrangement with the IRS in connection with such
discussions or other proceedings provided that (A) Seller agrees, in advance
of entering into such closing agreement or other arrangement, that it will
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons for any Losses resulting therefrom in
accordance with the provisions of Section 12.6, and (B) if the closing
agreement or other arrangement would obligate Buyer to implement changes to
its ongoing administration of the Covered Insurance Policies, then Seller may
not enter into any such closing agreement or other arrangement without Buyer's
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Should Buyer decide to withhold its consent to Seller's entering into
any closing agreement or other arrangement with the IRS, Buyer shall promptly
communicate such decision in writing to Seller. 













(vi) Unless otherwise provided in this Section 12.6(f), Buyer shall control
the

implementation of the corrective measures described in this Section 12.6(f) to
the extent that such corrective measures modify the administration of the
Covered Insurance Policies in order to make such administration compliant with
the Product Tax Law Rules.

(g) Cost-Sharing.

(i) Seller shall not have any obligation under this Section 12.6 to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnified Persons for costs attributable to modifying the
administration of the Covered Insurance Policies to make such administration
compliant with the Product Tax Law Rules unless the aggregate of all such
costs for which Seller would be liable under this Section 12.6 exceed $250,000
on a cumulative basis, provided that, once the aggregate amount of such costs
exceeds $250,000, Seller shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Persons for all such costs (without any deductible) as determined in
accordance with Section 12.6(g)(ii) and Section 12.6(g)(iii).

(ii) With respect to any Product Tax Claim, the costs of implementing
corrective measures to remediate Product Tax Non-Compliance described in such
claim, to the extent attributable to modifying the administration of the
Covered Insurance Policies to make such administration compliant with the
Product Tax Law Rules (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a reasonable
allocation of employee compensation attributable to such measures) shall be
shared between Seller and Buyer as follows:

(A) If, pursuant to Section 12.6(f)(ii), Seller and Buyer agree to the
appropriate corrective measures, then (1) with respect to a Product Tax Claim
for which a Product Tax Claim Notice is delivered to Seller on or before the
one-year anniversary of the Closing Date: 80 percent (80%) by Seller and 20
percent (20%) by Buyer; (2) with respect to a Product Tax Claim for which a
Product Tax Claim Notice is delivered to Seller after the one-year anniversary
of the Closing Date but on or before the two-year anniversary of the Closing
Date: 70 percent (70%) by Seller and 30 percent (30%) by Buyer; and (3) with
respect to a Product Tax Claim for which a Product Tax Claim Notice is
delivered to Seller after the two-year anniversary of the Closing Date but
prior to the expiration of the Post-Closing Three-Year Period: 60 percent
(60%) by Seller and 40 percent (40%) by Buyer.

(B) If, pursuant to Section 12.6(f)(iii), following arbitration, the
Accounting Firm selects the corrective measures proposed by Seller, then (1)
with respect to a Product Tax Claim for which a Product Tax Claim Notice is
delivered to Seller on or before the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date:
60 percent (60%) by Seller and 40 percent (40%) by Buyer; (2) with respect to
a Product Tax Claim for which a Product Tax Claim Notice is delivered to
Seller after the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date but on or before the
two-year anniversary of the Closing Date: 50 percent (50%) by Seller and 50
percent (50%) by Buyer; and (3) with respect to a Product Tax Claim for which
a Product Tax Claim Notice is delivered to Seller after the two-year
anniversary of the Closing Date but prior to the expiration of the Post-
Closing Three-Year Period: 40 percent (40%) by Seller and 60 percent (60%) by
Buyer.

(C) If, pursuant to Section 12.6(f)(iii), following arbitration, the
Accounting Firm selects the corrective measures proposed by Buyer, then with
respect to a Product Tax Claim for which a Product Tax Claim Notice is
delivered to 













Seller prior to the expiration of the Post-Closing Three-Year Period: 100
percent (100%) by Seller.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.6(g),
Buyer's

liability under this Section 12.6(g) shall be limited to $5 million, in the
aggregate, and any excess over such amount shall be borne 100 percent (100%)
by Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 12.6(g) shall apply only
to the cost of corrective measures attributable to modifying the
administration of the contracts to make such administration compliant with the
Product Tax Law Rules. All other costs and expenses attributable to Product
Tax Claims (for example, without limitation, any amounts payable to the IRS or
required to be refunded to policyholders) and all Losses resulting from
Related Claims shall be borne 100 percent (100%) by Seller as provided in this
Section 12.6.

Section 12.7 Changes to Final Closing Date Tax Reserves.

(a) Seller shall promptly notify Buyer if, as a result of the amendment of any
Tax Return, any Action, any claim or assessment by any Tax Authority (or any
compromise or settlement of any such claim or assessment), any change in
Reserves, or any other cause, the schedule of the Closing Date Tax Reserves
provided by Seller to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.5(c) (the "Final Closing
Date Tax Reserves") no longer accurately reflects the life insurance reserves
(within the meaning of Section 807(c) of the Code) maintained by Seller and
each Cedant as of the Closing Date (immediately prior to the Closing) with
respect to the Covered Insurance Policies, as reflected on Seller's
consolidated federal income tax return as filed, or as subsequently amended or
adjusted, and shall provide Buyer an updated schedule of such life insurance
reserves (the "Revised Closing Date Tax Reserves").

(b) Upon receipt of the schedule of Revised Closing Date Tax Reserves, Buyer
shall promptly provide Seller with (i) a detailed revised Asset Allocation
Schedule based on the Revised Closing Date Tax Reserves (the "Revised Asset
Allocation Schedule") and (ii) separate calculations (based on the Revised
Asset Allocation Schedule) reflecting Buyer's computation, as determined under
the Tax Acquisition Provisions, of the ceding commission (within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-11(c)(3), relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, using the Final
Closing Date Tax Reserves (the "Initial Tax Ceding Commission") and the
Revised Closing Date Tax Reserves (the "Revised Tax Ceding Commission"). The
Revised Asset Allocation Schedule (including the amounts allocated to all
assets other than the insurance-in-force) shall be based on, and shall be
consistent with, the Final Asset Allocation Schedule determined in accordance
with Section 2.5(b); provided, that if the Parties have not agreed on the
Final Asset Allocation Schedule, the Revised Asset Allocation Schedule shall
be based on, and shall be consistent with, the Asset Allocation Schedule
described in clause (x) of Section 2.5(b).

(c) To the extent that the Initial Tax Ceding Commission is greater than the
Revised Tax Ceding Commission, Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer the amount
determined in accordance with Schedule 12.7(c). To the extent that the Initial
Tax Ceding Commission is less than the Revised Tax Ceding Commission, Buyer
shall promptly pay to Seller the amount determined in accordance with Schedule
12.7(c).

(d) In the event that Seller disputes the accuracy of the Initial Tax Ceding
Commission or the Revised Tax Ceding Commission, Seller shall promptly provide
a written determination to Buyer to that effect, and Seller and Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable methods to resolve such dispute. In the event that
Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve the dispute in a timely manner, the
matter shall be referred to the Accounting Firm for a final determination of
the correct amount of the Initial Tax Ceding Commission or the Revised Tax
Ceding Commission. In such event, Seller and Buyer shall deliver to the 













Accounting Firm copies of any data, documentation, or other materials that may
reasonably be required by the Accounting Firm to make such determination. Each
of Seller and Buyer shall be entitled to submit to the Accounting Firm a
memorandum setting forth its position with respect to any disputed issue. For
the avoidance of doubt, except for amounts agreed to by the Parties pursuant
to Section 2.5, the Accounting Firm may consider the accuracy of the Revised
Asset Allocation Schedule in making its determination, provided, that with
respect to the valuation of any of the Investment Assets transferred by
Cedants to the Reinsurer pursuant to the Reinsurance Agreements, (x) the
Accounting Firm must select, as the fair market value of such asset as of the
Closing, either the value proposed by Buyer or the value proposed by Seller
and (y) the Accounting Firm shall not reach any determination regarding the
fair market value of any such Investment Asset unless the Accounting Firm
shall have determined, based on the information delivered to it by Seller and
Buyer, that the determination of the fair market value of such asset is
necessary in order to determine the amount payable by Buyer to Seller, or
Seller to Buyer, pursuant to this Section 12.7. The Accounting Firm shall
render its determination within sixty (60) days of the referral of such matter
for resolution. The determination of the Accounting Firm as to the correct
amount of the Initial Tax Ceding Commission and the Revised Tax Ceding
Commission shall be final and binding on all Parties for all purposes of this
Agreement. The costs incurred in retaining the Accounting Firm shall be shared
equally, fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.

(e) If, subsequent to the payment of any amount by Seller to Buyer (or by
Buyer to Seller) 
under Section 12.7(c), there is a Final Determination that results in a change
in the amount of the Revised Tax Ceding Commission used to determine the
payment under Section 12.7(c), Seller and Buyer agree to determine the amount
(if any) appropriately payable by Seller to Buyer (or by Buyer to Seller) as a
result of such change, based on the principles and procedures contained in
this Section 12.7. Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall promptly pay to
the other the amount so determined.

ARTICLE XIII 
TERMINATION

Section 13.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the

Closing Date:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

(b) by Buyer in the event of a material breach by Seller of any of Seller's
(i) covenants or 
agreements or (ii) representations or warranties contained herein that would
reasonably be expected to result in the conditions to Closing set forth in
Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.1(b) not being satisfied; provided, that in the
case of clause (i), if curable, Seller shall have failed to cure such breach
within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Buyer requesting
such breach to be cured;

(c) by Seller in the event of a material breach by Buyer of any of Buyer's (i)
covenants or 
agreements or (ii) representations or warranties contained herein that would
reasonably be expected to result in the conditions to Closing set forth in
Section 10.1(a) or Section 10.1(b) not being satisfied; provided, that in the
case of clause (i), if curable, Buyer shall have failed to cure such breach
within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Seller requesting
such breach to be cured;

(d) by Buyer or Seller if any court of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued a final and 
non-appealable Court Order, in each case, permanently restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or by the Reinsurance Agreements; or 













(e) by Buyer or Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
June 30, 2013 or

such later date as may be agreed to in writing by Buyer and Seller (the
"Termination Date").

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13.1 to the contrary, neither Party
may terminate this Agreement pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c), (d) or (e) above
if its failure to perform any of its obligations or covenants, or the
inaccuracy of any of its representations or warranties, under this Agreement
has been the principal cause of, or has resulted in, the event or condition
purportedly giving rise to a right to terminate this Agreement under such
paragraph.

Section 13.2 Notice of Termination. Any Party desiring to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1 (other than Section 13.1(a)) shall give
written notice of such termination to the other Party to this Agreement.

Section 13.3 Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement shall be

terminated pursuant to this Article XIII, all further obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement (other than Section 8.6, this Section 13.3 and
Article XIV (other than Section 14.1 and Section 14.2)) shall be terminated
without further Liability of either Party to the other; provided, that nothing
herein shall relieve either Party from Liability for fraud or intentional
breach of its covenants contained in this Agreement. For this purpose,
"intentional" means an action or omission that the breaching Party takes or
omits to take with the intent of breaching this Agreement.

ARTICLE XIV 
GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 14.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants. All

representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement through the
period during which claims for indemnification may be made for such
representations and warranties pursuant to Article XI or Article XII, as
applicable (at which time such representations and warranties shall
terminate). The covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that by
their terms apply or are to be performed in their entirety on or prior to the
Closing shall survive until the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date. Any other covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
shall survive for the period provided in such covenant or agreement, if any,
or otherwise, until fully performed.

Section 14.2 Remedies. Each Party agrees that any failure to perform, or
breach of its

obligations under this Agreement will result in irreparable injury to the
other Party, that the remedies available to such other Party at law alone will
be an inadequate remedy for such failure or breach and that, in addition to
any other legal or equitable remedies that such other Party may have, such
other Party may enforce its rights in court by an Action for specific
performance and the Parties expressly waive the defense that a remedy in
damages will be adequate or that an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Any Party seeking an order
or injunction to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

Section 14.3 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts of law
provisions) of the State of New York (other than Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of
the General Obligations Law, which shall apply). 













Section 14.4 Jurisdiction; Venue. Except as contemplated by Article II,

Section 12.6(f)(iii) or Section 12.7(d), each of the Parties hereto
irrevocably agrees that any and all Actions arising out of, relating to or in
connection with this Agreement or its subject matter and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
settlement or judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder brought by any other Party hereto or its
successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
courts of the State of New York located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City
of New York or in the courts of the United States of America for the Southern
District of New York. Each of the Parties agrees that mailing of process or
other papers in connection with any such Action in the manner provided in
Section 14.6 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Laws,
will be valid and sufficient service thereof. Each of the Parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Action for itself and in
respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any
Action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court or tribunal other than the aforesaid courts. Each
of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement
and the rights and obligations arising hereunder (a) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
Agreement, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the Action in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. In order to
facilitate the comprehensive resolution of related disputes, and upon request
of any Party to any Action, the court may consolidate the Action with any
other Action relating to this Agreement or to any Ancillary Agreement and the
Parties hereby agree not to oppose any request by the other Party to
consolidate any such Action with another Action relating to this Agreement or
to any Ancillary Agreement.

Section 14.5 Jury Waiver. EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND WHETHER MADE BY
CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM, THIRD-PERSON CLAIM OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HERETO
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS IN THIS
SECTION.

its Affiliates to acquire the Acquired Assets), the rights and obligations of
either Party under this Agreement shall not be assignable or delegable by such
Party hereto without the written consent of the other Party.

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties hereto and 
their successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed
or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any Person other
than the Parties and successors and assigns permitted 













by this Section 14.7 and the Buyer Indemnified Persons and the Seller
Indemnified Persons any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
Agreement.

Section 14.8 Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement, the Exhibits and
Schedules referred to herein, the documents delivered pursuant hereto, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements contain the entire
understanding of the Parties hereto with regard to the subject matter
contained herein or therein, and supersede all other prior representations,
warranties, agreements, understandings or letters of intent between or among
any of the Parties hereto which representations, warranties, agreements,
understandings or letters of intent shall be of no force or effect for any
purpose. Except for updates to Section 8.1(a) of the Business Disclosure
Schedule, this Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except
by a written instrument signed by an authorized Representative of each of the
Parties hereto or their respective successors in interest.

Section 14.9 Interpretation. The table of contents, articles, titles and
headings to

sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein shall be construed
with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as if they
were set forth verbatim herein. All references herein to Articles, Sections,
Exhibits and Schedules shall be construed to refer to Articles and Sections
of, and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". Unless the context
otherwise requires, the words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined
in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate
or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine genders of such term. Any agreement or instrument defined or referred
to herein or any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein means such
agreement or instrument as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including by waiver or consent, and references to all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. Any statute or
regulation referred to herein means such statute or regulation as amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of any
statute, includes any rules and regulations promulgated under such statute),
and references to any section of any statute or regulation include any
successor to such section. Any agreement referred to herein shall include
reference to all Exhibits, Schedules and other documents or agreements
attached thereto. The phrase "related to the Business" shall not have the
meaning attributed to "Related to the Business".

Section 14.10 Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived,
or the time for its performance may be extended, in writing at any time by the
Party or Parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be
validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as
to any Party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized Representative of
such Party. The failure of any Party hereto to enforce at any time any
provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such
provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part
hereof or the right of any Party thereafter to enforce each and every such
provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to
constitute a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach.

Section 14.11 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, each Party hereto will pay all costs
and expenses incident to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and
to its performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained
herein or therein on its part to be performed or complied with, including the
fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel and independent public
accountants. 













Section 14.12 Partial Invalidity. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
Applicable Law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would
be unreasonable.

Section 14.13 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, including by facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf
format, each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become binding
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties hereto
and delivered to Seller and Buyer.

Section 14.14 No Public Announcement. Neither the Parties nor any Affiliates
of the Parties shall, without the approval of Buyer, in the case of Seller and
its Affiliates, and Seller, in the case of Buyer and its Affiliates, in each
case not to be unreasonably withheld, make any press release or other public
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such Person shall be
so obligated by Applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange, in which
case the non-disclosing Party shall be advised and the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or
announcement to be issued; provided, that the foregoing shall not preclude
communications or disclosures necessary to implement the provisions of this
Agreement or to comply with the accounting and the SEC disclosure obligations
or the rules of any stock exchange.

Section 14.15 Disclosure Schedules. Any disclosure with respect to a Section
of any Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of
other Sections of such Disclosure Schedule only to the extent that such
disclosure sets forth facts in sufficient detail so that the relevance of such
disclosure to such other Sections would be readily apparent to a reader of
such disclosure. Matters reflected in any Section of a Disclosure Schedule are
not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be so
reflected. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes
and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature. No reference
to or disclosure of any item or other matter in any Section of a Disclosure
Schedule shall be construed as an admission or indication that such item or
other matter is material or that such item or other matter is required to be
referred to or disclosed in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no
such reference to or disclosure of a possible breach or violation of any
Contract, Applicable Law or order of any Governmental Body shall be construed
as an admission or indication that breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred.

Section 14.16 HFSG Guarantee. HFSG fully, irrevocably and unconditionally

guarantees to Buyer the full, complete and timely compliance with and
performance of all agreements, covenants and obligations of Seller from time
to time under this Agreement (the "Obligations" and, collectively, the
"Guaranty"). The Obligations shall include Seller's obligation to satisfy all
payment obligations of Seller arising in connection with this Agreement, in
each case, when and to the extent that, any of the same shall become due and
payable or performance of or compliance with any of the same shall be
required. HFSG hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Guaranty constitutes an
absolute, present, primary, continuing and unconditional guaranty of
performance, compliance and payment by Seller of the Obligations when due
under this Agreement and not of collection only and is in no way conditioned
or contingent upon any attempt to enforce such performance, compliance or
payment by a guaranteed party upon any other condition or contingency. HFSG
hereby waives any right to require a proceeding first against Seller. The
Obligations shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or
termination for any reason (other than by indefeasible payment or performance
in full of the Obligations) and shall not be subject to (i) any discharge of
Seller from any of the Obligations in a 













bankruptcy or similar proceeding (except by indefeasible payment or
performance in full of the Obligations) or (ii) any other circumstance
whatsoever which constitutes, or might be construed to constitute an equitable
or legal discharge of HFSG as guarantor under this Section 14.16.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, HFSG's obligations under this Section 14.16
shall terminate on the sixth (6th) anniversary the of the Closing Date unless,
before such date Buyer or a Buyer Indemnified Person, as applicable, has
provided to Seller or HSFG with notice of a claim (including an applicable
Claim Notice under Article XI), in which case such claim shall continue to be
subject to HFSG's Guarantee in accordance with this Section 14.16
notwithstanding the passing of such applicable date.
