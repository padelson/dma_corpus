ARTICLE II

Section 2.1. Purchase and Sale of the Shares. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Purchaser shall purchase and

below, the base purchase price for the Shares shall be $144,936,000 (the "Base
Purchase Price") as adjusted by the following without duplication: minus (i)
the amount of any Indebtedness that remains unpaid at the Closing, minus (ii)
the amount of any Change of Control Payments that remain unpaid at the

minus (iv) the amount of any Company Transaction Expenses, minus (v) the
amount of any Pre-Closing Taxes that remains unpaid at the Closing, plus (vi)
the amount of any Closing Company Cash, provided, however, in the case of
clauses (i), (ii), (iv), (v), and (vi) above, only to the extent such amounts
are not included in the Closing Net Working Capital determination (the
resulting amount, the "Purchase Price"). For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event the Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working
Capital, but less than the Excess Target Net Working Capital, there shall be
no adjustment of the Purchaser Price pursuant to Section 2.2(a)(iii).

(b) Closing Payments. At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be
paid, the following amounts by wire transfer of immediately available funds:

(i) to each holder of Repaid Indebtedness, an amount in cash set forth
opposite such Person's name in the Estimated Closing Date Statement to the

forth opposite such Person's name in the Estimated Closing Date Statement to

Statement; and

(vi) to the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the Sellers on a Pro Rata
Share basis), an amount in cash equal to (A) the Estimated Purchase Price as
set forth in the Estimated Closing Date Statement minus (B) the Adjustment
Escrow Amount minus (C) the Indemnity Escrow Amount minus (D) the Holdback
Amount, to the account designated by the Sellers' Representative in the
Estimated Closing Date Statement. HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED





Section 2.3. Purchase Price Adjustments.

(a) Estimated Closing Adjustment. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Sellers' Representative shall deliver to Purchaser a
statement (the "Estimated Closing Date Statement"), reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, setting forth a good faith calculation, together with reasonably
detailed supporting documentation, of: (i) Closing Net Working Capital and the
components thereof, (ii) the amount of each of (A) Indebtedness remaining
unpaid immediately prior to the Closing, (B) Change of Control Payments
remaining unpaid immediately prior to the Closing, (C) Company Transaction
Expenses, (D) Pre-Closing Taxes remaining unpaid at the Closing, and (E)
Closing Company Cash, and (iii) the resulting calculation of the Purchase
Price under Section 2.2(a) (the "Estimated Purchase Price"). The Estimated
Closing Date Statement and the calculations thereunder shall be prepared and
calculated by the Sellers' Representative in good faith.

(b) Closing Date Statement. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to the
Sellers' Representative a statement (the "Closing Date Statement") setting
forth Purchaser's calculation, together with reasonably detailed supporting
documentation, of (i) Closing Net Working Capital, (ii) the amount of each of
(A) Indebtedness remaining unpaid immediately prior to the Closing, (B) Change
of Control Payments remaining unpaid immediately prior to the Closing, (C)
Company Transaction Expenses, (D) Pre-Closing Taxes remaining unpaid
immediately prior to the Closing, including Transfer Taxes remaining unpaid
immediately prior to the Closing, and (E) Closing Company Cash (each of
clauses (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) only to the extent not included in the
Closing Net Working Capital determination), and (iii) the resulting
calculation of the Purchase Price under Section 2.2(a). The Closing Date
Statement and the calculations thereunder shall be prepared and calculated by
Purchaser in good faith in accordance with GAAP. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser shall have the right to
revise the Closing Date Statement and Purchaser's calculation of Closing Net
Working Capital, Indebtedness, Change of Control Payments, Company Transaction
Expenses, Pre-Closing Taxes, Closing Company Cash, and the resulting amount of
the Purchase Price in all respects based on fraud, willful misconduct or
intentional misrepresentation discovered by Purchaser at any time prior to the
determination of the Final Purchase Price in accordance with this Section 2.3.

(c) Disputes.

(i) If the Sellers' Representative objects to Purchaser's calculation of
Closing Net Working Capital, Indebtedness, Change of Control Payments, Company
Transaction Expenses, Pre-Closing Taxes (including Transfer Taxes), Closing
Company Cash, or the resulting calculation of the Purchase Price under Section
2.2(a) as set forth in the Closing Date Statement, then, within thirty (30)
days after the delivery to the Sellers' Representative of the Closing Date
Statement (the "Objection Period"), the Sellers' Representative shall deliver
to Purchaser a written notice (an "Objection Notice") describing in reasonable
detail the Sellers' Representative's objections to Purchaser's calculation of
the amounts set forth in such Closing Date Statement and containing a
statement setting forth the calculation of each amount set forth in such
Closing Date Statement, including the Purchase Price, in each case, determined
by the Sellers' Representative to be correct. If the Sellers' Representative
does not deliver an Objection Notice to Purchaser during the Objection Period,
then Purchaser's calculation of the amounts set forth in the Closing Date
Statement shall be binding and conclusive on the parties.

(ii) If the Sellers' Representative delivers an Objection Notice, and if the
Sellers' Representative and Purchaser are unable to agree upon the calculation
of the amounts set forth in the Closing Date Statement within ten (10)
Business Days after such Objection Notice is delivered to Purchaser, the
dispute shall be finally settled by the Accounting Firm. Within ten (10) days
after the Accounting Firm is appointed, Purchaser shall forward a copy of the
Closing Date Statement to the Accounting Firm, and the Sellers' Representative
shall forward a copy of the Objection Notice to the Accounting Firm, together
with, in each case, all relevant supporting documentation. The Accounting
Firm's role shall be limited to resolving such objections and determining the
correct calculations to be used on only the disputed portions of the Closing
Date Statement, and the Accounting Firm shall not make any other
determination, including any determination as to whether any other items on
the Closing Date Statement are correct or whether the Target Net Working
Capital is correct. The Accounting Firm shall not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by the Sellers'
Representative or Purchaser or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by the Sellers' Representative or Purchaser and shall be limited to
the selection of either the HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24b-2 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE
ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED





Sellers' Representative's or Purchaser's position on a disputed item (or a
position in between the positions of the Sellers' Representative or Purchaser)
based solely on presentations and supporting material provided by the parties
and not pursuant to any independent review. In resolving such objections, the
Accounting Firm shall apply the provisions of this Agreement concerning
determination of the amounts set forth in the Closing Date Statement. The
Accounting Firm shall deliver to the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser a
written determination (such determination to include a work sheet setting
forth all material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to
be based solely on information provided to the Accounting Firm by the Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser) of the disputed items submitted to the
Accounting Firm within thirty (30) days of receipt of such disputed items. The
determination by the Accounting Firm of the disputed amounts and the Purchase
Price shall be conclusive and binding on the parties, absent manifest error or
fraud or willful misconduct as determined by a non-appealable and binding
decision by a court of law having jurisdiction over the parties. The losing
party (as defined below) in any such proceeding shall pay all costs and fees
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of the prevailing party)
related to such determination by the Accounting Firm, including the costs
relating to any negotiations with the Accounting Firm with respect to the
terms and conditions of such Accounting Firm's engagement and the costs for
the Accounting Firm's services. For purposes of this Section 2.3(c), as
between the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser, the "losing party" in any
such determination shall mean the party whose calculation of the Purchase
Price (as set forth in the Closing Date Statement, in the case of Purchaser,
or in an Objection Notice, in the case of the Sellers' Representative), is
farthest from the calculation of the Purchase Price as determined by the
Accounting Firm; provided, however, that if the Sellers' Representative's and
Purchaser's calculations are both equally far from the calculation of the
Purchase Price as determined by the Accounting Firm, then the Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser shall split such costs and fees, one-half to
each. The parties agree that (except as otherwise provided in Section
9.2(a)(iv)) the procedure set forth in this Section 2.3 for resolving disputes
with respect to Closing Net Working Capital, Indebtedness, Change of Control
Payments, Company Transaction Expenses, Pre-Closing Taxes, Closing Company
Cash, and the resulting calculation of the Purchase Price under Section 2.2(a)
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for resolving such disputes; provided,
however, that the parties agree that judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the
party against which such determination is to be enforced.

(d) Payment of Purchase Price Adjustment.

(i) If the Purchase Price, as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.3 (the "Final Purchase Price"), exceeds the Estimated Purchase
Price, then Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days following the
determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 2.3, pay, or cause to be paid, to the Sellers' Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers on a Pro Rata Share basis) an amount equal to such
excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated in writing by the Sellers' Representative at least two (2)
Business Days prior to such payment date.

(ii) If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price, then
the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days
following the determination of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.3, deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Adjustment
Escrow Account an amount equal to such excess to Purchaser, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by
Purchaser in such joint written instructions. In the event the funds in the
Adjustment Escrow Account are insufficient to cover the amount of such excess,
then the Sellers' Representative shall provide written notice thereof to each
Seller, and each Seller shall pay to Purchaser, within ten (10) Business Days
following the receipt by such Seller of such written notice, an amount equal
to such Seller's Pro Rata Share of such shortfall not covered by the funds in
the Adjustment Escrow Account, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated in writing by Purchaser prior to such
payment date.

(iii) Once payment is made in accordance with Section 2.3(d)(i) or (ii), the
Sellers' Representative and Purchaser shall, within five (5) Business Days of
such payment, deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release to the Sellers' Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers on a Pro Rata Share basis) all remaining funds, if any,
in the Adjustment Escrow Account, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by the Sellers' Representative in such joint written
instructions. HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

calculation of EBITDA for the Earn-Out Period, and (B) the resulting
calculation of the Earn-Out Payment. If the Sellers' Representative agrees
with the calculations set forth on such Earn-Out Report, then the Company
shall pay or cause to be paid to the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers on a Pro Rata Share basis) an amount equal to such Earn-Out Payment
(such amount, the "Undisputed Earn-Out Payment"), if any, on or prior to
November 30, 2017 by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by the Sellers' Representative.

(ii) If the Sellers' Representative does not agree with the calculations set

final and binding upon the parties on the day that is thirty (30) days
following delivery thereof to the Sellers' Representative, unless the Sellers'
Representative shall have given written notice of disagreement (the "Earn-Out
Dispute Notice") to Purchaser prior to such date. The Earn-Out Dispute Notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted

determined by the Sellers' Representative to be correct.

(c) Inspection of Books and Records. During the thirty (30)-day period
following delivery of the Earn-Out Report, and upon the written request of the
Sellers' Representative, Purchaser shall provide the Sellers' Representative
and his accountants, upon reasonable notice at a mutually agreed upon time

hours, reasonable access to the books, records and personnel of the Company
that were utilized in the preparation of the Earn-Out Report to verify the

the matters asserted in the Earn-Out Dispute Notice. If, at the end of such
ten (10)-day period, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative have not so
resolved such differences, then the disputed matters shall be referred to the
Accounting Firm for resolution in a manner consistent with the provisions
pertaining to the Accounting Firm in Section 2.3(c)(ii) (including the
procedural and cost provisions thereof), mutatis mutandis. The Earn-Out
Payment, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.8(d), shall be
referred to herein as the "Final Earn-Out Payment".

(e) Timing of Final Earn-Out Payment. To the extent no Undisputed Earn-Out
Payment has been paid pursuant to Section 2.8(b)(i) above, then within five
(5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Earn-Out Payment, the

behalf of the Sellers on a Pro Rata Share basis), an amount in cash equal to
the Final Earn-Out Payment, by wire transfer to immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated in writing by the Sellers' Representative at

cause the Company to, use commercially-reasonable efforts to act in good faith
and in the spirit of fair dealing with respect to the provisions of this
Section 2.8 and shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, intentionally
take any action in bad faith which has the primary purpose of reducing the
earning or payment of the Earn-Out Payment (if any) (the "Earn-Out
Covenants"). Except for the express Earn-Out Covenants, none of Purchaser, any
of its Affiliates, the Company or any of their respective Representatives
shall have any obligation, express or implied, to operate the Company in any
particular manner so as to meet the requirements for the Earn-Out Payment as
set forth herein.

(g) Right of Setoff. In addition to any rights of setoff or other similar
rights that Purchaser or the Company may have at common law or otherwise, the
Company shall have the right to withhold and, in the case of clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii) below, deduct from the Undisputed Earn-Out Payment or the Final
Earn-Out Payment, as applicable, that is owed to the Sellers under this
Section 2.8: (i) any amount that is payable by the Sellers to Purchaser under
Section 2.3(d)(ii) but has not yet been paid; (ii) any amount that is payable
by the Sellers to any Indemnitee under Article IX but has not yet been paid;
and (iii) any amount for which there is a dispute as to whether such amount is
payable by the Sellers to Purchaser under Section 2.3 or to any Indemnitee
under Article IX pending final determination of such dispute (including any
final determination under Section 2.3 or Section 9.6).

(h) No Security. The parties understand and agree that (i) the contingent
right to receive the Earn-Out Payment shall not be represented by any form of
certificate or other instrument, is not transferable, and does not constitute
an equity or ownership interest in Purchaser or the Company, (ii) none of the
Sellers shall have any rights as a securityholder of Purchaser or the Company
as a result of such Seller's contingent right to receive the Earn-Out Payment
hereunder, and (iii) no interest is payable with respect to the Earn-Out
Payment.

(i) Restrictions on Earn-Out Payment. The Company shall not be obligated to
pay, and Sellers shall not be entitled to receive, the Earn-Out Payment, by
set-off or otherwise, if payment of the Earn-Out Payment (after giving pro
forma effect to a hypothetical advance under any Financing Document in the
amount of the Earn-Out Payment): (i) would be prohibited or blocked by or
result in a default (whether with the passage of time, giving of notice or
both) or an event of default under any Financing Document to which the Company
or any of its Affiliates (including Purchaser from and after the Closing) is a
party, if such default or event of default would result from the payment of
such Earn-Out Payment; or (ii) would cause the Company or any of its
Affiliates (including Purchaser from and after the Closing) not to be in pro
forma compliance with any covenant contained in any Financing Document
(including as a result of the failure to meet any minimum liquidity thresholds
necessary to prevent the testing of any such covenant) after giving effect to
the payment of the Earn-Out Payment; provided, however, that (x) the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cure such default or satisfy such
covenant, in each case that prohibits the payment of the Earn-Out Payment, at
the earliest date reasonably practicable (it being agreed and understood that
such HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24b-2 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE
ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED





efforts shall not require the Company to amend any Financing Document or to
change its payment practices under any Financing Document); and (y) the
Company's obligations to make the payment of the Earn-Out Payment shall be
reinstated once none of the conditions described in the foregoing clauses (i)
and (ii) are in existence; provided further, however, that if, as a result of
any of the conditions described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), the
Company is unable to make the Earn-Out Payment, if any, within thirty (30)
days of the Earn-Out Payment becoming due and payable, then interest shall
accrue on the amount due and not paid at the LIBOR Rate plus two percent (2%)
per annum, compounded annually from the date such payment is due until paid in
full.

(j) Tax Treatment. The parties shall treat and report the Undisputed Earn-Out
Payment or the Final Earn-Out Payment, as applicable, that the Sellers receive
pursuant to this Section 2.8 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

purposes of diverting their business or services from the Company.

(d) Each Seller agrees that he, she or it will not make or publish, verbally
or in writing, any statements concerning Purchaser, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives which
statements are or are reasonably likely to be construed as being injurious or
inimical to the best interests of Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives, including
statements alleging that Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives have acted improperly,
illegally or unethically or have engaged in business practices which are
improper, illegal or unethical; provided, however, that such restrictions
shall not apply to any confidential communications with any Governmental

law or in equity:

(i) the right and remedy to have such provision specifically enforced by any

breach or threatened breach may cause irreparable injury to each of Purchaser
and the Company and that money damages may not provide an adequate remedy to
Purchaser and the Company; and

suffered by Purchaser or the Company, as the case may be, as the result of any
acts or omissions constituting a breach of this Section 6.3.

to enter into this Agreement and consummate the Transactions. In the event
that any covenant contained in this Section 6.3 should ever be adjudicated to
exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations
permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is expressly
empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed reformed,
in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or service, or
other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants contained in this
Section 6.3 and each provision hereof are severable and distinct covenants and
provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or
provision as written shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the
remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such invalidity or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, whether anticipated or unanticipated,
whether suspected or unsuspected, which such Releasing Parties, or any of
them, ever have had or ever in the future may have against the Released

be deemed to have relied upon such representations, warranties, covenants or
obligations notwithstanding) any knowledge on the part of any of the
Indemnitees or any of their Representatives, regardless of whether obtained
through any investigation by any Indemnitee or any Representative of any
Indemnitee or through disclosure by any Seller or any other Person, and
regardless of whether such knowledge was obtained before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

and agrees that such Seller shall not have and shall not exercise or assert
(or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of

connection with this Agreement or any other agreement, document, certificate

party hereto, of any claim or Proceeding (whether against the Company,
Purchaser or any other Person) with respect to which the Sellers may become
obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee
pursuant to this Article IX (a "Third Party Claim"), Purchaser shall have the

if Purchaser requests that the Sellers' Representative consent to a
settlement, adjustment or compromise, the Sellers' Representative shall not
unreasonably withhold or delay such consent).

(b) If Purchaser does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such Third
Party Claim, the Sellers' Representative shall proceed with the defense of
such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser;
provided, however, that the Sellers' Representative may not settle, adjust or
compromise any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
Purchaser (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Purchaser shall give the Sellers' Representative prompt notice of the
commencement of any such Third Party Claim against any Indemnitee; provided,
however, that any failure on the part of Purchaser to so notify the Sellers'
Representative shall not limit any of the obligations of the Sellers under

suffered, or believes in good faith that it may incur or suffer, Damages for
which it is or may be entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated

aggregate amount of the actual and potential Damages that the Indemnitee
believes have arisen and may arise as a result of such facts and circumstances
(the aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may be modified by such
Indemnitee in good faith from time to time, being referred to as the "Claimed
Amount").

(b) During the thirty (30)-day period commencing upon delivery by an
Indemnitee to the Sellers' Representative of a Notice of Claim (the "Dispute
Period"), the Sellers' Representative may deliver to the Indemnitee who

Escrow Account, to the Escrow Agent a written response (the "Response Notice")

is owed to the Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that part, but not all, of the Claimed
Amount (such agreed portion, the "Agreed Amount") is owed to the Indemnitee;
or (iii) indicates that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the
Indemnitee. If the Response Notice is delivered in accordance with clause (ii)
or (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Response Notice shall also contain a
brief description of the facts and circumstances supporting the Sellers'
Representative's claim that only a portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is
owed to the Indemnitee, as the case may be. Any part of the Claimed Amount
that is not agreed to be owed to the Indemnitee pursuant to the Response
Notice (or the entire Claimed Amount, if the Sellers' Representative asserts
in the Response Notice that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the
Indemnitee) is referred to in this Agreement as the "Contested Amount" (it
being understood that the Contested Amount shall be modified from time to time
to reflect any good faith modifications by the Indemnitee to the Claimed
Amount). If no Response Notice is delivered prior to the expiration of the
Dispute Period, then the Sellers shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed
that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee.

(c) If: (i) the Sellers' Representative delivers a Response Notice agreeing
that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee; or (ii) the Sellers'
Representative does not deliver a Response Notice during the Dispute Period,
then, within three (3) Business Days following the receipt of such Response
Notice by the Indemnitee (or, to the extent funds remain in the Indemnity
Escrow Account, by the Escrow Agent) or within three (3) Business Days after
the expiration of the Dispute Period, as the case may be: (A) to the extent
funds remain in the Indemnity Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent shall release
to the applicable Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Account an amount in
cash equal to the full Claimed Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain in
the Indemnity Escrow Account); provided, however, that to the extent the funds
in the Indemnity Escrow Account are insufficient to cover the Claimed Amount,
the Sellers' Representative shall provide written notice thereof to each
Seller, and each Seller shall pay to the applicable Indemnitee, within three
(3) Business Days following the receipt by such Seller of such written notice,
such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the amount by which the Claimed Amount exceeds
the remaining funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account; or (B) to the extent no
funds remain in the Indemnity Escrow Account, each Seller shall pay to the
applicable Indemnitee such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the full Claimed Amount.

(d) If the Sellers' Representative delivers a Response Notice during the
Dispute Period agreeing that less than the full Claimed Amount is owed to the
Indemnitee, then within three (3) Business Days following the receipt of such
Response Notice by the Indemnitee (or, to the extent funds remain in the
Indemnity Escrow Account, by the Escrow Agent): (i) to the extent funds remain
in the Indemnity Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent shall release to the
applicable Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Account an amount in cash
equal to the Agreed Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain in the
Indemnity Escrow Account); provided, however, that to the extent the funds in
the Indemnity Escrow Account are insufficient to cover the Agreed Amount, the
Sellers' Representative shall provide written notice thereof to each Seller,
and each Seller shall pay to the applicable Indemnitee, within three (3)
Business Days following the receipt by such Seller of such written notice,
such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the amount by which the Agreed Amount exceeds
the remaining funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account; or (ii) to the extent no
funds remain in the Indemnity Escrow Account, each Seller shall pay to the
applicable Indemnitee such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the Agreed Amount.

(e) If the Sellers' Representative delivers a Response Notice during the
Dispute Period indicating that there is a Contested Amount, the Sellers'
Representative and the Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to resolve HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED





the dispute related to the Contested Amount. If the Indemnitee and the
Sellers' Representative resolve such dispute, a settlement agreement
stipulating the amount owed to the Indemnitee (the "Stipulated Amount") shall
be signed by the Indemnitee and the Sellers' Representative. Within three (3)
Business Days following the execution of such settlement agreement (or such
shorter period of time as may be set forth in the settlement agreement): (i)
to the extent funds remain in the Indemnity Escrow Account, the Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to the applicable
Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Account an amount in cash equal to the
Stipulated Amount (or such lesser amount as may remain in the Indemnity Escrow
Account); provided, however, that to the extent the funds in the Indemnity
Escrow Account are insufficient to cover the Stipulated Amount, the Sellers'
Representative shall provide written notice thereof to each Seller, and each
Seller shall pay to the applicable Indemnitee, within three (3) Business Days
following the receipt by such Seller of such written notice, such Seller's Pro
Rata Share of the amount by which the Stipulated Amount exceeds the remaining
funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account; or (ii) to the extent no funds remain
in the Indemnity Escrow Account, each Seller shall pay to the applicable
Indemnitee such Seller's Pro Rata Share of the Stipulated Amount.

(f) In the event that there is a dispute relating to any Notice of Claim or
any Contested Amount (whether it is a matter between any Indemnitee, on the
one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, or it is a matter that is
subject to a Third Party Claim brought against any Indemnitee) that remains
unresolved after application of the terms of this Section 9.6, such dispute
shall be settled in accordance with Section 11.11 hereof.

Section 9.7. Setoff. In addition to Section 9.6 and any rights of setoff or
other similar rights that Purchaser or any of the other Indemnitees may have
at common law or otherwise, Purchaser shall have the right to withhold and
deduct from any sum that is or may be owed to any Seller hereunder (a) any
amount that is payable by the Sellers to Purchaser under Section 2.3(d)(ii)
but has not yet been paid; (b) any amount that is otherwise payable by any
Seller to any Indemnitee under this Article IX but has not yet been paid; and
(c) any amount for which there is a dispute as to whether such amount is
payable by the Sellers to Purchaser or any Indemnitee under this Agreement
pending final determination of such dispute (including any final determination
under Section 2.3 or Section 9.6).

Section 9.8. Exercise of Remedies Other Than by Purchaser. No Indemnitee
(other than Purchaser, the Company or any successor thereto or assign thereof)
shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other
remedy under this Agreement unless Purchaser, the Company or any successor
thereto or assign thereof, as the case may be, shall have consented to the
assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

Section 9.9. Source of Payment.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Indemnitees shall first seek
reimbursement on account of Damages for any claims brought under this Article
IX from the Indemnity Escrow Account until the Indemnity Escrow Amount
(including any interest accrued or income otherwise earned on the Escrow
Amount) has been fully exhausted or otherwise released in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement prior to Purchaser exercising its rights
pursuant to Section 9.7 on account of such Damages or seeking reimbursement
from Sellers on account of such Damages; provided, however, that Purchaser
shall not be entitled to seek reimbursement from Sellers on account of such
Damages directly unless and until any Undisputed Earn-Out Payment or Final
Earn-Out Payment, as applicable, that is due and payable has been fully offset
against.

(b) If Sellers are determined to owe an amount pursuant to this Article IX to
any Indemnitee that may be satisfied from Sellers directly (a "Seller Payment
Obligation"), then each Seller shall deliver an amount equal to such Seller's
Pro Rata Share of such Seller Payment Obligation to such Indemnitee by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
such Indemnitee.

Section 9.10. Indemnity Escrow Release.

(a) If the funds remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account, including any
interest accrued or income otherwise earned thereon, as of the date that is
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date (the "Indemnity HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24b-2 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE
ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED





Escrow Balance") exceed the aggregate dollar amount, as of the date that is
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date, of Claimed Amounts and Contested
Amounts associated with all indemnification claims contained in any Notice of
Claim that have not been finally resolved and paid prior to the date that is
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date in accordance with Section 9.6
(each, an "Unresolved Indemnity Escrow Claim" and the aggregate dollar amount
of such Claimed Amounts and Contested Amounts as of the date that is eighteen
(18) months from the Closing Date being referred to as the "Pending Indemnity
Claim Amount"), then the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser shall, within
three (3) Business Days following the date that is eighteen (18) months from
the Closing Date, deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow Account an
amount equal to the Indemnity Escrow Balance minus the Pending Claim Amount to
the Sellers' Representative (on behalf of the Sellers on a Pro Rata Share
basis).

(b) Following the date that is eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date, if
an Unresolved Indemnity Escrow Claim is finally resolved, Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative shall, within three (3) Business Days after the final
resolution of such Unresolved Indemnity Escrow Claim, deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release from
the Escrow Account: (i) to the applicable Indemnitee an amount in cash
determined in accordance with Section 9.6, and (ii) to the Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers on a Pro Rata Share basis) an amount
equal to the amount (if any) by which the amount of funds remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Account, including any interest accrued or income otherwise
earned thereon, as of the date of resolution of such Unresolved Indemnity
Escrow Claim exceeds the aggregate amount of the remaining Pending Claim
Amount.

Section 9.11. Exclusive Remedy. Except: (a) for equitable relief, to which any
party hereto may be entitled pursuant to this Agreement; (b) for Damages
resulting from or arising out of fraud or intentional misrepresentation; and
(c) as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, after the Closing the
indemnification provided in this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the parties for monetary damages for any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement.

this Agreement or any of the Transactions, except by mutual consent of
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative and except as required by any Law
(it being understood that prior to making any such announcement, statement or
acknowledgement as required by any Law, Purchaser and the Sellers'

(b) Each Seller shall, and shall cause his, her or its Affiliates to, and
shall instruct his, her or its and their respective Representatives to, hold

Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect and shall in no

good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the

in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware (including in respect of
the statute of limitations or other limitations period applicable to any state
Law claim, controversy or dispute) that apply to agreements made and performed

provisions thereof or of any other jurisdiction. Each party hereto agrees and
acknowledges that the application of the Laws of the State of Delaware is
reasonable and appropriate based upon the parties' respective interests and
contacts with the State of Delaware. Each of the parties waives any right or
interest in having the Laws of any other state, including specifically, state
Law regarding the statute of limitation or other limitations period, apply to
any party's state Law claim, controversy or dispute which in any way arises
out of or relates to this Agreement or the Transactions.

Section 11.9. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,

Closing Date Statement, the Closing Date Statement and the determination of
the Purchase Price under Section 2.3, on all matters relating to the Earn-Out
Report and the determination of the Earn-Out Payment under Section 2.8, on all
tax matters under Article VII, on all matters relating to any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Article IX, and on all
matters related to the Escrow Agreement; and (ii) Purchaser, each Indemnitee
and each such party's Representatives shall be entitled to rely conclusively
(without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any document executed or
purported to be executed on behalf of any Seller by the Sellers'
Representative, and on any other action taken or purported to be taken on
behalf of any Seller by the Sellers' Representative, as fully binding upon
such Seller. The Sellers, individually and independently, hereby acknowledge
and agree that (x) the Sellers' Representative shall be solely responsible for
ensuring that each Seller receives that portion of any amount(s) to which such
Seller is entitled in connection with the Transactions based upon his, her or
its Pro Rata Share and which is paid by Purchaser to the Seller's
Representative; and (y) Purchaser shall bear no obligation or responsibility
to any Seller with regard to the obligations of the Sellers' Representative
relating to the pro-rata distribution of such payments or otherwise.

(c) Power of Attorney. Each Seller recognizes and intends that the power of
attorney granted in this Section 11.13: (i) is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Sellers' Representative; and (iii)
shall survive the death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
each of the Sellers. HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED





(d) Holdback Amount. Each Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that the
Holdback Amount shall be withheld from the Estimated Purchase Price as set
forth in the Estimated Closing Date Statement and shall be paid by Purchaser
directly to an account maintained by the Sellers' Representative (or a
financial institution selected by the Sellers' Representative) as a fund for
the fees and expenses (including, without limitation, any legal fees and
expenses) of the Sellers' Representative incurred in connection with this
Agreement, with any balance of the Holdback Amount not utilized for such
purposes to be returned to the Sellers in accordance with their Pro Rata
Share; provided, however, that in no event shall any portion of the Holdback
Amount be returned to the Sellers prior to twenty-four (24) months after the
Closing. If the Holdback Amount shall be insufficient to satisfy the fees and
expenses of the Sellers' Representative, and if there are any remaining funds
in the Indemnity Escrow Account to be distributed to the Sellers immediately
prior to the final distribution from the Indemnity Escrow Account to the
Sellers, then the Sellers' Representative shall be entitled to recover any
such expenses from the Indemnity Escrow Account to the extent of such funds
prior to the distribution of funds to the Sellers. The Sellers' Representative
shall be entitled to recover any remaining expenses directly from the Sellers.

(e) Limitation of Liability and Indemnification. The Seller's Representative,
in his individual capacity, will not be liable to Purchaser for any payment
obligation of the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement. The Seller's
Representative will not be liable to the Sellers for any act done or omitted
hereunder as the Seller's Representative while acting in good faith and not in
a manner constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct, and any act done
or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel will be conclusive evidence of
such good faith. The Sellers will severally indemnify the Seller's
Representative and hold the Seller's Representative harmless against any
Damages incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
the Seller's Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Seller's Representative's duties
hereunder.

(f) Replacement. If the Sellers' Representative shall die, resign, become
disabled, or otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities hereunder,
the Sellers shall (by consent of the Sellers entitled to at least a majority
of the Purchase Price), within ten (10) days after such death, resignation,
disability, or inability, appoint a successor to the Sellers' Representative
(who shall be reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser) and immediately thereafter
notify Purchaser of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall
succeed the Sellers' Representative as Sellers' Representative hereunder. If
for any reason there is no Sellers' Representative at any time, all references
herein to the Sellers' Representative shall be deemed to refer to the Sellers.
