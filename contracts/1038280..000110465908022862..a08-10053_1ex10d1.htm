 **ARTICLE II 
  
 PURCHASE AND SALE**

  



  

 **2.01** **_Purchase and Sale_**. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, each Seller, severally but not jointly, shall
sell to Buyer and Newco, and Buyer and Newco shall purchase from each such
Seller in accordance with _Schedule 2.01_ , at the Closing, all right, title
and interest of such Seller in and to the Partnership Interests as set
forth opposite such Sellers name on _Schedule 2.01_ , free and clear of
all claims, Liens, restrictions and encumbrances and on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

  



  

 **2.02** **_Purchase Price Determination_**.

  



  

(a) The aggregate purchase price for the Partnership Interests is equal to
the sum of (i) 115,552,166.00, plus (ii) the Post Closing Net Cash Amount,
minus (iii) the Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing, minus
(iv) all reasonably estimable Liabilities, minus (v) all Seller Expenses,
minus (vi) the Equipment Adjustment, if any, minus (vii) the Laundry Lease
Adjustment, if any (the " _Purchase Price_ ").

  



  

(b) The Purchase Price will be allocated among the Sellers pro rata in
accordance with each Sellers Fraction set forth in _Schedule 2.01_.  Within
ninety days (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to the
Sellers Representative a closing statement, which shall set forth
the Closing Adjustment, the Indebtedness, the Indebtedness Adjustment, the
Seller Expenses, the Seller Expense Adjustment, the reasonably estimable
Liabilities and the Liabilities Adjustment (the " _Closing Statement_ "). The
Buyer will make available to the Sellers Representative all records and work
papers used in preparing the Closing Statement that are reasonably necessary
for the Sellers Representative to confirm the Buyers computations therein.
 If the Sellers Representative disagrees with the calculations contained in
the Closing Statement, the Sellers Representative may, within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the Closing Statement, deliver a written notice
(an " _Objection Notice_ ") to the Buyer setting forth the Sellers
Representatives computation of the Closing Adjustment, the Indebtedness, the
Indebtedness Adjustment, the Seller Expenses, the Seller Expense Adjustment,
the reasonably estimable Liabilities and the Liabilities Adjustment as the
case may be, and information, arguments and support for such computation. If
the Buyer has not received an Objection Notice within thirty (30) days after
the Sellers Representative has received the Closing Statement, then the
parties will be deemed to have agreed to the Closing Adjustment, the
Indebtedness, the Indebtedness Adjustment, the Seller Expenses, the Seller
Expense Adjustment, the reasonably estimable Liabilities and the Liabilities

  



        
   

  



  

Adjustment as set forth in the Closing Statement. The Buyer and the Sellers
Representative will attempt, in good faith, to resolve any disputes, as set
forth in the Objection Notice, as to the computation of the Closing
Adjustment, the Indebtedness, the Indebtedness Adjustment, the Seller
Expenses, the Seller Expense Adjustment, the reasonably estimable Liabilities
and the Liabilities Adjustment.  If the Buyer and the Sellers Representative
do not achieve final resolution within twenty (20) days after the Buyer has
received the Objection Notice, then the Buyer and the Sellers will retain
Ernst and Young LLP (the " _Accountant_ ") to resolve any remaining disputes.
The Accountant will consider only those items and amounts in the Closing
Statement set forth in the Objection Notice which the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative are unable to resolve. The Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall each make a submission to the Accountant within twenty
(20) days after the Accountants engagement, which submission shall contain a
computation of the Closing Adjustment, the Indebtedness, the Indebtedness
Adjustment, the Seller Expenses, the Seller Expense Adjustment, the
reasonably estimable Liabilities and the Liabilities Adjustment
and information, arguments, and support for such computation. The Accountant
shall review such submissions and base its determination solely on such
submissions (without an independent review). In resolving any disputed
item, the Accountant may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by the Buyer or the Sellers
Representative or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by the
Buyer or the Sellers Representative. The Accountants determination will be
based on the definitions of the Closing Adjustment, the Indebtedness, the
Indebtedness Adjustment, the Seller Expenses, the Seller Expense Adjustment,
the reasonably estimable Liabilities and the Liabilities Adjustment in this
Agreement. The determination of the Accountant will be conclusive and binding
upon the parties. The Accountant shall reach a decision not later than six
(6) months after a dispute is submitted to it. The costs of such
Accountants review (including reasonable attorneys fees of counsel
providing a legal opinion to, and at the request of, the Accountant, if any)
shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Sellers.

  



  

 **2.03 _Additional Purchase Price Adjustments._**

  



  

(a) _Equipment Adjustment_. Within 120 days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall determine, as of the Closing Date, the number of all washers and
dryers located at the Laundry Lease locations (the " _Closing Equipment
Count_ ") and shall deliver to the Sellers Representative a schedule
reflecting such count. The Sellers Representative shall be deemed to accept
the Closing Equipment Count unless the Sellers Representative delivers a
notice of objection to Buyer within thirty (30) days following receipt of the
Closing Equipment Count. If the Sellers Representative provides a notice of
objection to Buyer, the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall first use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute. If the parties are
able to resolve such dispute, the Closing Equipment Count shall be revised to
the extent necessary to reflect such resolution and shall be conclusive and
binding upon all parties and shall not be subject to dispute or review.  If
the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within twenty (20) days after
delivery of a notice of objection by the Sellers Representative,
either party may submit the dispute to the Accountant for resolution, which
shall be subject to the procedures and limitations described in Section
2.02(b). The Closing Equipment Count

  



        
   

  



  

as determined by the Accountant shall be conclusive and binding upon all
parties and shall not be subject to dispute or review. If the Closing
Equipment Count as finally determined is less than the "Equipment Target" set
forth on _Schedule 2.03(a)_ (the " _Equipment Target_ "), then Sellers shall
pay to Buyer an amount in cash equal to (i) the Equipment Target minus the
Closing Equipment Count multiplied by (ii) the "Equipment Multiple" set forth
on _Schedule 2.03(a)_ (the " _Equipment Multiple_ "), and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by such amount. Any amount due from Sellers to Buyer
under this Section 2.03(a) shall bear interest in accordance with Section
2.05(d) from the date the Closing Equipment Count is finally determined. If
the Closing Equipment Count as finally determined equals or exceeds the
Equipment Target, then no payment shall be required from Sellers to Buyer
under this Section 2.03(a). For purposes of calculating the Closing Equipment
Count, each stacked washer and/or stacked dryer unit and 25 lb. or more
washer or tumbler dryer shall be counted as two (2) machines, and each other
washer and dryer shall be counted as one (1) machine. The Purchase Price shall
be adjusted as necessary to reflect any payment made pursuant to this Section
2.03(a).

  



  

(b) _Laundry Lease Adjustment_.

  



  

(i) Within ten (10) days after July 30, 2008, Buyer shall prepare and deliver
to the Sellers Representative a schedule (the " _Lease Schedule_ ") listing
each Restricted Laundry Lease for which the required consents to the
assignment to Buyer of such Restricted Laundry Lease have not been obtained
by July 30, 2008 (each a " _Non-Assigned Lease_ " and collectively, the "
_Non-Assigned Leases_ "); provided that if Buyer does not deliver the Lease
Schedule within the period described above then there shall be no Laundry
Leases Adjustment (as defined below). The Sellers Representative shall be
deemed to accept the Lease Schedule unless the Sellers Representative
delivers a notice of objection to Buyer within thirty (30) days following
receipt of the Lease Schedule. If the Sellers Representative provides a
notice of objection to Buyer, the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall
first use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute. If the
parties are able to resolve such dispute, the Lease Schedule shall be revised
to the extent necessary to reflect such resolution and shall be conclusive
and binding upon all parties and shall not be subject to dispute or review.
If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within twenty (20) days
after delivery of a notice of objection by the Sellers Representative,
either party may submit the dispute to the Accountant for resolution, which
shall be subject to the procedures and limitations described in Section
2.02(b). The Lease Schedule as determined by the Accountant shall be
conclusive and binding upon all parties and shall not be subject to dispute
or review. The Lease Schedule shall specify for each Non-Assigned Lease
listed, an amount equal to the Equipment Multiple multiplied by the number of
Machines subject to such Non-Assigned Lease and the sum of all such amounts
listed on such Lease Schedule for all Non-Assigned Leases (the " _Total Non-
Assigned Lease Amount_ "). The Sellers shall only pay Buyer to the extent the
Total Non-Assigned Lease Amount exceeds the "Threshold Amount" set forth on
_Schedule 2.03(b)_ hereto, and then only to the extent of such excess (the "
_Laundry Lease Adjustment_ "). For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Restricted Laundry Lease_ " means a Laundry Lease which, as a

  



        
   

  



  

result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, requires the
consent or approval of a third party to transfer or assign such Laundry Lease
to Buyer. A Laundry Lease that requires a third party consent or approval to
assign such Laundry Lease from the Company to another party shall not
constitute a Restricted Laundry Lease unless the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are deemed to constitute an assignment under the express terms
of such Laundry Lease or Laundry Lease otherwise has express terms requiring
consent to, or approval of, the transactions contemplated hereby by a third
party.

  



  

(ii) Any amount due from Sellers to Buyer under this Section 2.03(b) shall
bear interest in accordance with Section 2.05(d) from the date the Laundry
Lease Adjustment is finally determined. The Purchase Price shall be reduced by
an amount equal to the Laundry Lease Adjustment.

  



  

(c) _Route Cash_.

  



  

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Post-Closing Net Cash Amount_ " for a
Laundry Lease location means the sum of (a) all undeposited collections made
by the Company from such location prior to Closing, whether in transit to
banks, in counting rooms or in vehicles at the time of Closing, less the
aggregate amount of commissions, revenue sharing payments and route rental
payments in respect of such undeposited collections, and (b) (i) the
aggregate amount of cash collected by Buyer from such Laundry Lease location
from the first collection by Buyer of such location after the Closing less
the aggregate amount of commissions, revenue sharing payments and route
rental payments payable in respect of such cash collection multiplied by (ii)
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from and including
the last date on which the Company collected from such Laundry Lease location
prior to the Closing Date (as reflected on _Schedule 3.06_ hereto) to but
excluding the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of
days from and including the last date on which the Company collected from
such Laundry Lease location prior to the Closing Date (as reflected on
_Schedule 3.06_ hereto) to but excluding the first date that Buyer collects
from such location on or following the Closing. The costs of collections made
pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) will be borne by the Buyer.

  



  

(ii) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to the
Sellers Representative a schedule setting forth a calculation of the Post-
Closing Net Cash Amount for each Laundry Lease location (the " _Net Cash
Settlement Statement_ "). Unless the Sellers Representative notifies Buyer
in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Net Cash Settlement
Statement that the Sellers Representative disagrees with such statement (and
provides reasonable detail of the nature of each disputed item), such Net
Cash Settlement Statement shall be deemed the " _Final Net Cash Settlement
Statement_ ," shall be binding upon all parties and shall not be subject to
dispute or review. If the Sellers Representative does provide such notice to
Buyer within such thirty-day period, Buyer and the Sellers Representative
shall first use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute and,
if the parties are able to resolve

  



        
   

  



  

such dispute, the Net Cash Settlement Statement shall be revised to the
extent necessary to reflect such resolution, shall be deemed the " _Final Net
Cash Settlement Statement_ " and shall be conclusive and binding upon all
parties and shall not be subject to dispute or review. If the parties are
unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after Buyers receipt
of the Sellers Representatives notice, either party may submit the dispute
to the Accountant for resolution, which shall be subject to the procedures
and limitations described in Section 2.02(b). The Net Cash Settlement
Statement as determined by the Accountant shall be deemed the " _Final Net
Cash Settlement Statement_ ," shall be conclusive and binding upon all
parties and shall not be subject to dispute or review. If the Sellers
Representative does not dispute the Final Net Cash Settlement Statement, then
Buyer shall remit to Sellers the amount allocated to Sellers on such
Statement within ninety-five (95) days of the Closing Date. If the Sellers
Representative disputes the Final Net Cash Settlement Statement, then Buyer
shall promptly remit to Sellers the amount, if any, that is not in dispute
and remit any additional amount allocated to Sellers pursuant to a final
resolution reached by agreement between the parties or determined by the
Accountant, as soon as reasonably practical after the dispute is resolved.

  



  

(iii) Any amount due from Buyer to the Sellers Representative under this
Section 2.03(c) shall bear interest in accordance with Section 2.05(d) from
the date the Closing Net Cash Amount is finally determined.

  



  

(d) The costs of the Accountants review under any of clauses (a), (b) or (c)
of this Section 2.03 (including reasonable attorneys fees of counsel
providing a legal opinion to, and at the request of, the Accountant, if any),
shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Sellers.

pursuant to the applicable section to the date of payment at the rate which
is equal to the Prime Rate as published, from time to time, in the
_Wall Street Journal_ under "Money Rates," computed on the basis of a 365-day

set forth as _items [1], [2], [3], [4] and [5] of Schedule 3.12(b)_ , (i)
the Sellers shall be responsible for all rent, utilities, common area
maintenance and other similar costs and obligations under such leases that
relate to a period both before and after the Closing Date based on a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days to which such cost or
obligation relates to the period prior to the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the total

  



        
   

  



  

number of days to which such cost or obligation relates, and (ii) the Buyer
shall be responsible for all rent, utilities, common area maintenance and
other similar costs and obligations under such leases that relate to a period
both before and after the Closing Date based on a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days to which such cost or obligation relates to the
period on or after the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total
number of days to which such cost or obligation relates.

  



  

(d) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing, Buyer will deliver to the
Sellers Representative a schedule of proposed prorations (the " _Proration
Schedule_ "). Unless the Sellers Representative notifies Buyer in writing
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Prorations Schedule that the
Sellers Representative disagrees with such statement (and provides
reasonable detail of the nature of each disputed item), such Prorations
Schedule shall be deemed the " _Final Prorations Schedule_ ," shall be
binding upon all parties and shall not be subject to dispute or review. If
the Sellers Representative does provide such notice to Buyer within such
thirty-day period, Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall first use
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute and, if the parties
are able to resolve such dispute, the Prorations Schedule shall be revised to
the extent necessary to reflect such resolution, shall be deemed the " _Final
Prorations Schedule_ " and shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties
and shall not be subject to dispute or review. If the parties are unable
to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after Buyers receipt of
the Sellers Representatives notice, either party may submit the dispute to
the Accountant for resolution, which shall be subject to the procedures and
limitations described in Section 2.02(b). The Prorations Schedule as
determined by the Accountant shall be deemed the " _Final Prorations
Schedule_ ," shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties and shall not
be subject to dispute or review.  If the Sellers Representative does not
dispute the Prorations Schedule, then Buyer or the Sellers, as the case may
be, shall remit to the other party the amount reflected on such schedule as
being owed to such party within ninety-five (95) days after the Closing Date.
If the Sellers Representative disputes the Prorations Schedule, then Buyer
or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall remit to the other party the
amount, if any, that is not in dispute and any additional amounts owed will
be paid in accordance with a final resolution reached by agreement between
the parties or determined by the Accountant, as soon as reasonably practical
after the dispute is resolved.

  



  

(e) Any amount due under this Section 2.06 shall bear interest in accordance
with Section 2.05(d) from the date the Final Prorations Schedule is finally
determined. The costs of the Accountants review under this Section 2.06
(including reasonable attorneys fees of counsel providing a legal opinion
to, and at the request of, the Accountant, if any), shall be borne 50% by
Buyer and 50% by Sellers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 2.06, any prorations and adjustments pursuant to this Section 2.6
shall not include an adjustment for any Excluded Liability, which Excluded
Liabilities shall remain the sole responsibility of the Sellers.

  



  

 **2.07** **_Certain Commission Payments_**. After the Closing the Company or
Buyer will make certain commission payments for the month ended March 31,
2008 related to cash collected and deposited by the Company prior to the
Closing Date. Such commission payments

  



        
   

  



  

are Excluded Liabilities and the Sellers will, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, reimburse the Company and Buyer for such
payments on the date such payments are made.

  



  

 **ARTICLE III**

  



  

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RELATING TO 
 THE COMPANY**

  



  

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules dated as of the date hereof
and delivered herewith to Buyer and Newco (which disclosure schedules
identify the section and subsection to which each disclosure therein
relates), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer and Newco as of
the date hereof and as of the Closing Date that:

  



  

 **3.01** **_Limited Partnership Existence and Power_**. The Company is a
limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Texas, and has all limited partnership powers
and all governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals
required to carry on its business as now conducted. The Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign limited partnership and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the property owned or
leased by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore delivered to
Buyer true and complete copies of the organizational documents of the Company
as currently in effect.

  



  

 **3.02** **_Limited Partnership Authorization_**. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and each Transaction Document to
which the Company is a party, and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, are within the Companys
limited partnership powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary
limited partnership action on the part of the Company. Each of this
Agreement and each Transaction Document to which the Company is a party has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except as enforcement may be limited in bankruptcy or by equitable
principles.

  



  

 **3.03** **_Governmental Authorization; Consents_**. The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company and Sellers of this Agreement require no
action by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency,
official or authority other than compliance with any applicable requirements
of the HSR Act. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.03_  and except as
required under any Laundry Lease, no material consent, approval, waiver or
other action (a " _Required Consent_ ") by any Person (other than any
governmental body, agency, official or authority) under any
contract, agreement, indenture, lease, instrument or other document to which
the Company is a party or by which it is bound is required or necessary for
the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and
each Transaction Document to which the Company is a party, or for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  



        
   

  



  

 **3.04** **_Non-Contravention_**. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Company of this Agreement and each Transaction Document to which
the Company is a party, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, do not and will not (i) contravene or
conflict with the organizational documents of the Company, (ii) assuming
compliance with the HSR Act, contravene or conflict in any material respect
with any provision of any law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order,
Permit or decree binding upon or applicable to the Company; (iii) assuming
the receipt of all Required Consents, constitute a material default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material right or obligation
of the Company or to a loss of any material benefit to which the Company is
entitled under any provision of any agreement, contract or other instrument
binding upon the Company or by which any of its assets may be bound or (iv)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company.

  



  

 **3.05** **_Capital Structure_**. The Partnership Interests represent the
only outstanding equity or ownership interests in the Company. The
Partnership Interests have been duly authorized and validly issued, and were
not issued in violation of any Law. There are no options, warrants, purchase
rights, subscription rights, conversion rights, exchange rights or other
contracts or commitments that could require the Company to issue, sell
or cause to become outstanding any additional ownership interests or
other securities in the Company. Except as set forth in the Companys
Limited Partnership Agreement, there are no restrictions on the transfer of
the Partnership Interests, other than those imposed by relevant state and
federal securities laws, and there are no co-sale rights, rights of first
refusal, voting agreements or other agreements relating to the issuance,
sale, registration or voting of the Partnership Interests. None of the
Partnership Interests has been issued and owned or held in violation of any
preemptive right. The Partnership Interests set forth opposite of each
Sellers name on _Schedule 2.01_ hereto are owned of record and beneficially
by such Seller free and clear of all Liens, claims, encumbrances, voting
trusts or restrictions of any kind (except as set forth in the
Companys Limited Partnership Agreement), and the transfer and delivery of
the Partnership Interests to the Buyer by the Sellers as contemplated by this
Agreement will be sufficient to transfer good and valid record and beneficial
title and ownership in such Partnership Interests to the Buyer free and clear
of all Encumbrances (except as set forth in the Companys Limited
Partnership Agreement).

  



  

 **3.06** **_Laundry Leases_**. _Schedule 3.06_ hereto contains a

since November 30, 2007, (i) has been terminated by the Company or any third
party, or (ii) has been entered into by the Company. True and correct copies
of all the Laundry Leases have been delivered or made available to Buyer
prior to the date hereof. Each of the Laundry Leases is valid, in full force
and effect and binding upon the Company and the other parties thereto in
accordance with its respective terms,

  



        
   

  



  

subject to bankruptcy and limitations on equitable remedies.  Neither the
Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party is in default
under or in arrears in the performance, payment or satisfaction of any
agreement or condition on its part to be performed or satisfied under any
Laundry Lease, nor, to the Companys Knowledge, does any condition exist that
with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute such a default, and no
waiver or indulgence has been granted under any Laundry Lease. Except as set
forth on _Schedule 3.06_ , the Company has not received any written notice of
and the Company has no Knowledge of (i) any fact which would result in the
termination, amendment, modification or breach of any Laundry Lease and (ii)
any desire or intention of any party to renegotiate, terminate, amend, modify
or materially reduce the services of the Company under any Laundry Lease.
Except for consents, approvals and notices required under the Laundry Leases,
no consent or approval of or prior notice to any third party is required in
order to assign all of the Laundry Leases to Buyer or otherwise as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Assuming all of such consents and approvals are obtained, after giving effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Laundry
Leases will be valid and effective in accordance with its terms, and
enforceable by the Company against the other party thereto.   _Schedule
3.06_ sets forth a correct and complete list of all bonds (performance or
other), letters of credit, guarantees and similar arrangements relating to
the Laundry Leases.

 **ARTICLE VI**

  

 ** **

  

 **ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

  



  

 **6.01** **_Confidentiality_**. Upon Closing, each Seller shall treat
and hold, and shall cause its Affiliates to treat and hold, as confidential
any proprietary information concerning the Company, including any notes,
analyses, compilations, studies, forecasts, interpretations or other
documents that are derived from, contain, reflect or are based upon any such
proprietary information (the " _Confidential_ _Information_ "), refrain from
using any of the Confidential Information, and deliver promptly to Buyer, at
the request and option of Buyer, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of
the Confidential Information which are in its possession or under its
control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not
include information that is generally available to the public other than as a
result of a breach of this Section 6.01 or other act or omission of any
Seller or any of its Affiliates. In the event that any Seller or any of
its Affiliates is requested or required to produce information or documents
in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand,
or similar process to disclose any Confidential Information, such Person
shall notify the Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that the
Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the
provisions of this Section 6.01. If, in the absence of a protective order or
the receipt of a waiver hereunder, any Seller or any of its Affiliates is, on
the advice of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to
any tribunal, such Person may disclose the Confidential Information to the
tribunal; provided, that such disclosing Person shall use its reasonable
commercial efforts to seek, at the request and expense of Buyer, an order or
other assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such portion
of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed as Buyer shall
designate.

  



  

 **6.02** **_Tax Matters_** The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between the Buyer and the Sellers for certain
tax matters following the Closing Date:

  



  

(a) _Tax Indemnification_. The Sellers jointly and severally shall indemnify
the Buyer Indemnified Parties and hold them harmless from and against, any
Loss, claim, liability, expense, or other damage attributable to (i)
all Taxes (or the non-payment

  



        
   

  



  

thereof) imposed on the Company for all taxable periods ending before the
Closing Date and the portion through the end of the day prior to the Closing
Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing
Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (ii) all Taxes of any member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company (or
any predecessor of the foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the
Closing Date, (iii) Taxes of any person imposed on the Company as a
transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule or
regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before
the Closing Date, and (iv) breach of the representations in Section 3.24 and
(v) any Excluded Taxes.

  



  

The applicable Buyer Indemnified Party shall provide a notice of claim for
indemnification hereunder to Sellers Representative, which notice shall
include evidence that such tax has been due and/or has been paid.  Sellers
shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Party within 5 days after receipt of
notice. In the Sellers discretion, the Sellers may request such Buyer
Indemnified Party to file a claim for refund with respect to such indemnified
Taxes. Sellers shall bear the expenses of preparing and prosecuting such
refund action. To the extent a refund with respect to such indemnified Taxes
paid by the Sellers is actually recovered by a Buyer Indemnified Party, such
Buyer Indemnified Party shall pay such refund to the Sellers Representative
within a reasonable time of receipt.

  



  

The Sellers obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant
to this Section 6.02(a) shall survive the Closing until thirty (30) days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations; provided,
that, if the Buyer Indemnified Parties provide the Sellers with notice of a
claim to indemnify prior to the end of such period, the Sellers will still be
obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for such claim.
 Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to dollar-for-dollar
indemnification from the first dollar and shall not be subject to the
Sellers Basket or the Indemnity Cap Amount in seeking indemnification under
this Section 6.02(a).

  



  

(b) _Straddle Period_. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but
does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of
Taxes that is allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (i) in the case
of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis (such as real property taxes),
be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or in the
case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period
ending before (and excluding) the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period and
(ii) in the case of Taxes that are not described in clause (i) above (such as
income Taxes, the Texas Revised Franchise Act, Taxes imposed in connection
with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property, and payroll and
similar Taxes), be deemed to be equal to the amount that would have been
payable if the taxable year or period of the Company ended on the day prior
to the Closing Date.

  



  

Except for federal, state and local income tax returns, the Buyer shall file,
or shall cause the Company to file, any tax return relating to the Company
for any Straddle

  



        
   

  



  

Period, and the Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes shown as due
on any such returns. At least ten (10) days prior to filing any such return,
Buyer shall provide the Sellers Representative with a copy of such return
and a notice setting forth the calculation regarding the amount of such Taxes
allocable to the Sellers under this Section 6.02(b). Sellers Representative
shall have five (5) days to either (i) make reasonable objection to the
calculation or allocation of any such Taxes to Sellers, or (ii) pay the
amount shown as due from Sellers to Buyer. If reasonable objection is made,
the parties shall consult and resolve in good faith any such objection, it
being understood and agreed that in the absence of any resolution, any and
all such objections shall be resolved by treating items in a manner
consistent with the past practices with respect to such items. Payment shall
be made as soon as practical thereafter.

  



  

With respect to federal, state and local income tax returns, Sellers shall
retain the right to file the final Form 1065 and Forms K-1 with respect to
the Company for the short taxable year ending on the day prior to the Closing
Date. The income of the Company will be apportioned to the period up to and
excluding the Closing Date, and the period on or after the Closing Date, by
closing the books and records of the Company on the day prior to the Closing
Date. For purposes of allocating and apportioning income before and after the
Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers shall reasonably approximate items of income
and deduction with respect to the Route Cash and Accounts Receivable in
accordance with the allocations set forth in Sections 2.03(c) and 6.05 of
this Agreement.

  



  

Sellers shall retain the authority to control the final disposition or
settlement of any tax claim or assessment made with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, subject to compliance with applicable law. Buyer and
Sellers shall cooperate and jointly control the disposition or settlement of
any tax claim or assessment made with respect to any Straddle Period. With
respect to all proceedings or litigation with respect to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and Straddle Periods, Buyer and Sellers shall consult and cooperate
with each other in good faith to resolve the controversy with the applicable
taxing authority.

  



  

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Buyer, the Company, and the Sellers shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other partys request) the provision of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
The Company and the Sellers agree (A) to retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or the Sellers, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B)
to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party
so requests, the Company or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the
other party to take possession of such books and records.  Buyer and Sellers
shall work in good faith together to make any

  



        
   

  



  

election under the Texas Revised Franchise Tax to minimize taxes imposed on
Buyer and/or Sellers, provided that such election will not have an adverse
affect on any of the parties.

  



  

(d) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All tax-sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Company, if any, shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company
shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

  



  

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. Sellers will pay, and will indemnify and hold the Buyer
Indemnified Parties harmless against, any sales Tax, use Tax, real property
transfer or gains Tax, stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax, or other similar Tax
imposed on any of the Company or the Buyer Indemnified Parties as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (but excluding any such taxes
that result from actions taken by the Company or Buyer after the
Closing) (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and any penalties or interest
with respect to the Transfer Taxes. The Sellers agree to cooperate with
Buyer in the filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes,
including promptly supplying any information in their possession reasonably
requested by Buyer that is reasonably necessary to complete such returns.

  



  

(f) _Allocation of Purchase Price_. For Tax purposes, Buyer and Sellers
agree to allocate the Purchase Price consistently with Schedule 6.02(f)
attached hereto.  Buyer shall prepare Form 8594 consistently with such
Schedule, and shall provide Sellers a copy of such Form 8594 so that Sellers
may confirm consistency with such Schedule. Buyer and Sellers shall file all
Tax Returns and reports consistently with such allocations. Buyer and Sellers
shall promptly inform one another of any challenge by any taxing authority to
any allocation made pursuant to this paragraph and agree to consult with and
keep one another informed with respect to the state of, and any discussion,
proposal or submission with respect to, such challenge.

  



  

(g) The Buyer and the Sellers agree that for federal income tax purposes, the
Sellers sale of Partnership Interests to the Buyer shall be treated under
Revenue Ruling 99-6 as (A) a sale by each Seller of its partnership interest
in the Company to the Buyer, and (B) a purchase by the Buyer of the assets of
the Company from the Sellers.

  



  

 **6.03** **_Further Assurances_**. After the Closing, each party hereto
shall cooperate with the others, and execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such other instruments, including instruments of
conveyance, assignment and transfer, and use commercially reasonable efforts
to take all such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the other
parties hereto from time to time, consistent with the terms of this
Agreement, to effectuate the purposes and provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

 **6.04** **_Seller Releases_**.

_however_ , that the Released Causes of Action shall not include any rights
and claims of any Releasing Party arising from or in connection with this
Agreement or any Transaction Document, in each case to the extent arising

(b) Each Seller hereby represents to the Released Parties that as of the

intends to release all Released Causes of Action against the Released Parties
including, without limitation, unknown and contingent Released Causes of
Action (other than those specifically reserved above), and (iii) has

 Furthermore, each Seller further agrees not to institute any

to the Released Causes of Action.

  



  

(c) Each Seller hereby represents and warrants that it has access to adequate
information regarding the terms of this Agreement, the scope and effect of
the releases set forth herein, and all other matters encompassed by this
Agreement to make an informed and knowledgeable decision with regard to
entering into this Agreement. Each Seller further represents and
warrants that it has not relied upon the Company, the Buyer or the Released
Parties in deciding to enter into this Agreement and has instead made its own
independent analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.

  



  

 **6.05** ** _Accounts Receivable_.**

  



  

(a) Immediately prior to Closing, the Company shall distribute to the Sellers
an undivided interest in the accounts receivable of the Company with respect
to the

  



        
   

  



  

Companys laundry equipment sales and equipment rental business as of the
Closing Date (collectively, " _Accounts Receivable_ "). On or as soon
as practicable after the Closing Date, Sellers Representative will prepare
and deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth the outstanding Accounts
Receivable, including the dates on which payments thereunder are due.
Effective upon the Closing, the Sellers hereby appoint Buyer their agent for
collection of all of the Accounts Receivable as provided herein. For
a period of ninety (90) days following the Closing Date (the "
_Collection Period_ "), Buyer will collect the Accounts Receivable
substantially in the same manner and with the same diligence that Buyer uses
to collect its own accounts receivable. During the Collection Period, the
Sellers will not undertake, directly or indirectly, the collection of the
Accounts Receivable other than pursuant to Buyers obligations on Sellers
behalf under the terms and conditions of this Section 6.05.

  



  

(b) All amounts received by Buyer during the Collection Period from an
account debtor of Accounts Receivable shall be applied first to the Accounts
Receivable of such account debtor in the order of their origination, unless
the account debtor designates a specific invoice for payment or disputes such
Accounts Receivable in writing, in which case the payment of such account
debtor shall be applied to the Accounts Receivable as designated by the
account debtor. Within fifteen (15) days after the end of each calendar month
during the Collection Period, Buyer will deliver to the Sellers
Representative a report with respect to the collections made with respect to
the Accounts Receivable for such month and will remit to the Sellers
Representative, on behalf of Sellers the total amount so collected during
such month.  Except for such actions as it would customarily take in the
ordinary course, Buyer will not be obligated to take any other actions,
including the institution of litigation, the employment of any collection
agency, legal counsel, or other third party, or other means of collections or
pay any expenses to third parties to collect the Accounts Receivable. If
during the Collection Period a dispute arises with regard to an account
included among the Accounts Receivable, Buyer shall promptly advise the
Sellers Representative thereof and may (or, if requested by the Sellers
Representative, will) turn over collection efforts for that account to the
Sellers Representative, on behalf of Sellers. At the end of the Collection
Period, collection efforts for all uncollected Accounts Receivable shall be
turned over by Buyer to the Sellers Representative, on behalf of Sellers.
Any amounts received by Buyer in respect of any Accounts Receivable following
the Collection Period shall be promptly remitted to the Sellers
Representative.

  



  

 **6.06** **_Insurance_**. At or promptly following the Closing, the Company
shall terminate all insurance policies and coverages in effect prior to the

paid to Buyer pursuant to such terminations shall be delivered to the
Sellers Representative for distribution to the Sellers in accordance with
such Sellers Fraction. Premiums for any insurance policies or coverages
maintained in force after the Closing shall be prorated based on the numbers
of days each such policy or coverage was in effect prior to the Closing and
the number of days such policy or coverage was or will be in effect after the
Closing until it is terminated or is scheduled to expire, and Buyer shall
reimburse Sellers for prorated premiums allocated to Buyer.

  



     

      
 

  



  

 **6.07** **_Terminated Contracts_**. At any time within 90 days following

with an asterisk, specifying the proposed date of termination (the "
_Termination Date_ ", which Termination Date may not be later then the 90th
day following closing) for each contract listed in such notice (the "
_Terminated Contracts_ "). Any liabilities resulting from such terminations
and/or buyouts as well as all liabilities arising under such Terminated
Contracts from and after the Termination Date will be paid by the Sellers;
provided, that the terms of any such termination and/or buyout will
be subject to the reasonable consent of the Sellers Representative. For the
avoidance of doubt the parties hereto agree that Buyer will make the ordinary
payments required under the Terminated Contracts listed on Schedule 6.07 that
are designated with an asterisk (but not any costs arising under such
Terminated Contracts from and after the Termination Date or associated with
the termination and/or buyout of such Terminated Contracts) from and after
the Closing and until the respective Termination Dates of such Terminated
Contracts. All contracts listed on Schedule 6.07 that are not designated with

with the terms of any such termination and/or buyout subject to the
reasonable consent of the Sellers Representative.

and 50% by Sellers.

  



  

 **6.10** **_Re-Hiring of Terminated Employees_**. The Buyer hereby covenants
and agrees that if any employee of the Company is terminated by the Company
upon or after the Closing and such termination results in additional Seller
Expenses, the Buyer will, in the event that it re-hires any such terminated
employee within one year of the Closing Date, reimburse the Sellers, in
accordance with each Sellers Fraction, an amount equal to the additional
Seller Expenses.

  



  

 **6.11** **_Company s 2007 Audit_**. The Sellers and Buyer agree that the
costs and expenses of Clifton Gunderson LLP incurred in connection with the

solely for use in public laundromats owned and/or operated by such business
(and not for resale), up to a maximum amount of 100 machines per year, and

 **6.14** **_Certain Employee Benefits_**. For a period of thirty (30) days
after Closing, the Sellers hereby covenant and agree to cause J.C. Pace

Basket_"), whereupon the total amount of such Representation and Warranty
Losses in excess of the Sellers Basket shall be recoverable in accordance
with the terms hereof.

  



  

(c) _Time Limitation_. Subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection

claim.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) _Purchase Price Limitation on Certain Claims_.  Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
dollar-for-dollar indemnification from the first dollar up to the amount of

 **8.03** **_Indemnification by Buyer and Newco_**.  Buyer, Newco and their
respective successors and permitted assigns agree subsequent to the Closing
to indemnify and hold harmless Sellers, their subsidiaries and their
affiliates and their respective partners, officers, directors, employees and
agents (individually, a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the

Losses arising out of, based upon or in connection with:

 **8.04** ** _Limitations on Indemnification by Buyer and Newco_.**

  



  

(a) _Maximum Indemnification_. Buyers and Newcos obligation to indemnify
Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of Seller Indemnifiable Losses
described in or arising under Section 8.03(b) shall be limited, in the
aggregate, to an amount equal to the Indemnity Cap Amount.

  



  

(b) _No Limitation on Certain Claims_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to dollar-for-
dollar indemnification from the first dollar and shall not be subject to the
Indemnity Cap Amount or any limitation as to time (other than applicable

Newco with respect to any of the following:

  



  

(i) Losses described in or arising under Sections 8.03(a), (c) or (d); and

  



  

(ii) Losses described in or arising under Section 8.03(b) involving a breach

(c) _Time Limitation_. Subject to the exception set forth in Section
8.04(b), no indemnification shall be payable to a Seller Indemnified Party
with respect to any claim asserted after the Expiration Date which relates to
Seller Indemnifiable Losses described in or arising under Section
8.03(b); provided that any claim for indemnification as to which notice has
been given prior to the Expiration **** Date **** shall survive such
expiration until final resolution of such claim.

  



  

 **8.05 _Notice; Defense of Claims_.**

  



  

(a) _Notice of Claims_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of
notice of any claim, liability or expense to which the
indemnification obligations hereunder would apply, the indemnified party
shall give notice thereof in writing (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the
indemnifying party, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party
promptly will not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability except
(i) to the extent that the indemnifying party shall have been materially
prejudiced as a result of the failure or delay in giving such Claim Notice
and (ii) that no indemnification will be payable to an indemnified party with
respect to any claim for which the Claim Notice is given after expiration of
the period for which such claim may be made pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.04
(as the case may be) of this Agreement. Such Claim Notice shall state the
information then available regarding the amount and nature of such claim,
liability or expense and shall specify the provision or provisions of this
Agreement under which the liability or obligation is asserted.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) _Third Party Claims_. With respect to third party claims, if
within thirty (30) days after receiving the Claim Notice the indemnifying
party gives written notice (the " _Defense Notice_ ") to the indemnified
party stating that (i) it may be liable under the provisions hereof for
indemnity in the amount of such claim if such claim were successful and (ii)
that it disputes and intends to defend against such claim, liability or
expense at its own cost and expense, then counsel for the defense shall be
selected by the indemnifying party (subject to the consent of the indemnified
party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the indemnified
party shall not be required to make any payment with respect to such claim,
liability or expense as long as the indemnifying party is conducting a good
faith and diligent defense at its own expense; provided, however, that the
assumption of defense of any such matters by the indemnifying party shall
relate solely to the claim, liability or expense that is subject or
potentially subject to indemnification.

  



  

The indemnifying party shall have the right, with the consent of the
indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, to
settle all identifiable matters related to claims by third parties which are
susceptible to being settled provided the indemnifying parties obligation to
indemnify the indemnified party therefor will be fully satisfied.  The
indemnifying party shall keep the indemnified party apprised of the status of
the claim, liability or expense and any resulting suit, proceeding
or enforcement action, shall furnish the indemnified party with all documents
and information that the indemnified party shall reasonably request and
shall consult with the indemnified party prior to acting on major matters,
including settlement discussions. Notwithstanding anything herein stated,
the indemnified party shall at all times have the right to fully participate
in such defense at its own expense directly or through counsel; provided,
however, if the named parties to the action or proceeding include both the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards
of professional conduct, the expense of one separate counsel for the
indemnified party shall be paid by the indemnifying party.

  



  

If no Defense Notice is given by the indemnifying party, or if diligent good
faith defense is not being or ceases to be conducted by the indemnifying
party, the indemnified party shall, at the expense of the indemnifying party,
undertake the defense of (with counsel selected by the indemnified party),
and shall have the right to compromise or settle such claim, liability or
expense. If such claim, liability or expense is one that by its nature cannot
be defended solely by the indemnifying party, then the indemnified party
shall make available all information and assistance that the indemnifying
party may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the indemnifying party
in such defense.

  



  

(c) _Non-Third Party Claims_. With respect to non-third party claims, if
within thirty (30) days after receiving the Claim Notice the indemnifying
party does not give written notice to the indemnified party that it contests
such indemnity, the amount of indemnity payable for such claim shall be as
set forth in the Claim Notice.  If the indemnifying party provides written
notice to the indemnified party within such 30-day period that it contests
such indemnity, the parties shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement
with regard thereto within thirty (30) days of delivery of the indemnifying
partys notice. If the parties cannot reach agreement within such 30-day
period, the parties may pursue such remedies as are available to them at law
or in equity.

  



        
   

  



  

 **8.06** **_No Subrogation_**. Following the Closing, Sellers shall have
no right of indemnification, contribution or subrogation against the Company
with respect to any indemnification payments by any Seller or Sellers under
Section 8.01 or any set-off under Section 8.07.  Sellers shall have a right
of contribution against each other with respect to amounts actually paid
pursuant to Section 8.01, but such right of contribution shall in no way
limit or affect Buyers, Newcos and the Companys rights contained in this
Article VIII.

  



  

 **8.07** **_Limited Right of Set-Off_**. Each Buyer Indemnifiable Party (or
the Buyer on its behalf) shall have the right to set-off against any
unsatisfied principal amount of the Note (whether or not such principal
amount is then due and payable) the amount of any Buyer Indemnifiable Losses
suffered or incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Party, in accordance with the
procedures, and subject to the limitations, set forth in this Section 8.07.

  



  

(a) _Set-Off Procedures_. In the event that any Buyer Indemnified Party gives
Sellers a Claims Notice pursuant to Section 8.05(a) hereof and advises that
it intends to exercise its right of set-off with respect to such claim (a "
_Set-Off Claim_ "), and if Sellers do not give timely written notice pursuant
to Section 8.05(c) that they contest such Set-Off Claim, or if Sellers notify
the Buyer Indemnified Party within the period of timely notice thereunder
that they agree to indemnify all or a portion of such Set-Off Claim, then the
principal amount of the Note shall be reduced by the full amount of such Set-
Off Claim, or the portion thereof that is uncontested, if any portion of such
Set-Off Claim is contested. From and after the date of such
principal reduction, interest on the Note shall accrue only on the remaining
principal of the Note, but no set-off of interest shall be made or permitted,
and interest shall continue to accrue and be paid on the remaining principal
of the Note in accordance with its terms. The parties shall attempt during
the 30-day period following notice of a contested Set-Off Claim to reach
agreement regarding any disputed portion of such Set-Off Claim. If the parties
cannot reach agreement within such 30-day period, the parties may pursue such
remedies as are available to them at law or in equity. Absent any agreement
by the parties or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction resolving in
favor of the Buyer Indemnified Party a disputed Set-Off Claim, no set-off of
the disputed Set-Off Claim shall be permitted. If a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that interest has accrued and been paid on principal
of the Note that was subject to a valid Set-Off Claim but was not set-off,
the Sellers shall return such amount of interest to the maker of the Note
together with interest on such amount at the rate provided by the Note from,
and including, the date of payment to, but not including, the date such
interest is returned.

  



  

(b) _Claims Unresolved at Maturity._ If any unsatisfied Set-Off Claim has
not been resolved by agreement of the parties or by an order of a court of
competent jurisdiction when the principal of the Note becomes due
and payable, Buyer shall deposit an amount equal to the least of (i)
the aggregate amount of unsatisfied Set-Off Claims, (ii) the
remaining principal amount of the Note and (iii) the excess of $5,825,000
over the aggregate amount set off against the principal of the Note prior to
maturity, with an escrow agent satisfactory to Sellers Representative to be
held and paid over in accordance with an escrow agreement to be executed by
the parties substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto. The remaining
principal amount of the Note, if any, shall be paid in accordance with its
terms.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) _Priority of Set-Off._ For so long as there remains outstanding
any principal amount of the Note, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall first
proceed with set-off as provided under this Section 8.07 with respect to
claims for Buyer Indemnifiable Losses described in or arising under Sections
8.01(b), (c), (d) or (e), before proceeding against one or both Sellers
with respect to such claims, and then only to the extent that the aggregate
amount of unsatisfied Set-Off Claims exceeds $5,825,000; provided, however,
that if at any time the aggregate amount of both resolved and unsatisfied
Set-Off Claims exceeds $5,825,000, then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
have the right to proceed directly against the Sellers with respect to such
excess. This Section 8.07 shall not limit or restrict the right of Buyer
Indemnified Parties to proceed against one or both Sellers (without the need
to first make a Set-Off Claim) with respect to claims for Buyer Indemnifiable
Losses described in or arising under Sections 8.01(a).

  



  

 **8.08** **_Exclusive Remedy_**. After the Closing, Section 6.02 and this
Article VIII shall provide the exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation or
breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement or other claim arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, other than with
respect to claims for actual fraud or equitable remedies, including but not
limited to specific performance and injunctive relief.

  



  

 **8.09** **_No_   _Punitive Damages_**.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, no indemnifying party shall be liable
for punitive damages, except to the extent any indemnified party suffered
Losses for punitive damages paid to a third-party.

  



  

 **8.10** **_Tax Treatment_**. The parties agree to treat all payments made
pursuant to this Article VIII or Section 6.02 as adjustments to the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes.

(v) the Sellers Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for Damages
with respect to any action taken or any omission by Sellers Representative
pursuant to this Article IX, except to the extent such Damages are caused by
Seller Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct.

  



  

(d) Each Seller agrees that, notwithstanding the foregoing, at the request of
Buyer, it shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation,
delivery of such Sellers Partnership Interests and acceptance of the
purchase price therefor) individually on its own behalf.

  



  

 **9.02** **_Limitation on Actions_**. Any claim, action, suit or other
proceeding, whether at law or in equity, to enforce any right, benefit or
remedy granted to Sellers under this Agreement shall be asserted, brought,
prosecuted, or maintained only by Sellers Representative on behalf of
Sellers. Any claim, action, suit or other proceeding, whether at law or in
equity, to enforce any right, benefit or remedy granted under this Agreement,
including without limitation any right of indemnification provided in this

this Section, a Seller shall be bound by any settlement or release to which
Sellers Representative shall become a party.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended prior to the Closing Date
if, and only if, such amendment is in writing and signed by Buyer, the
Company and the Sellers. Any provision of this Agreement may be waived if
the waiver is in writing and signed by the party to be bound, which in the
case of the Sellers may be done by Sellers Representative.

  



  

(b) No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or

remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by law.

  



  

 **10.03** **_Expenses_**. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with

 **10.04** **_Successors and Assigns_**.

  



  

(a) The rights of either Party under this Agreement shall not be assignable
by such Party hereto prior to the Closing without the written consent of the
other Party.

  



  

(b) Following the Closing, neither Party may assign any of its rights
hereunder to any third Person without the written consent of the other Party,
except that either Party may assign its rights hereunder to an Affiliate. Any
assignment hereunder (whether before or after the Closing) shall not relieve
the assigning Party of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and
their successors and permitted assigns.  Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any
Person other than the Parties and successors and assigns permitted by this
Section 10.04 any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
Agreement.

  



  

 **10.05** **_Further Assurances_**. From time to time after the Closing, at
the request of Buyer and without further consideration, Sellers will execute

transferable title to the Partnership Interests.

in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of Delaware,
without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

received a counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto.

  



  

 **10.08** **_Entire Agreement_**. This Agreement, the Note, the
Noncompetition Agreements and the Escrow Agreement constitute the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements (including, without limitation, that certain
letter agreement among the Buyer, Company and Sellers, dated as of December
10, 2007), understandings and negotiations, both written and oral, between
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  No representation,
inducement, promise, understanding, condition or warranty not set forth
herein has been made or relied upon by either party hereto.

  



  

 **10.09** **_Captions_**. The captions herein are included for convenience
of reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or interpretation
hereof.

  



  

 **10.10** **_Jurisdiction_**. Any action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising out of, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought against any
of the parties in the state and federal courts of the State of Delaware, and
each of the parties hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and
of the appropriate appellate courts from such courts) in any such action or
