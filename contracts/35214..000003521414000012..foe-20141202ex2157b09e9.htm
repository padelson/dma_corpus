 \t\t

 \t\t\t3.1Purchase Price. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe consideration for the purchase and sale of the Vetriceramici
Interest shall be an amount equal to:  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Euro 83,000,000 (eighty three million); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) plus 100% of the Closing Date Cash; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) minus 100% of the Closing Date Financial Debt (inclusive, for the
sake of clarity, of the Outstanding Debt); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)(x) in the event the Closing Date Working Capital falls below the
Target Working Capital reduced by the Tolerance Amount, minus an amount equal
to the difference between (i) 100% of the shortfall, and (ii) the Tolerance
Amount, or (y) in the event that the Closing Date Working Capital is greater
than the Target Working Capital increased by the Tolerance Amount, plus an
amount equal to the difference between (i) 100% of such greater amount and
(ii) the Tolerance Amount (for the avoidance of doubt, the equations in (x)
and (y) above shall be interpreted according to the following examples: (1) if
Closing Date Working Capital = Euro 14,000,000, then equation in (x) above is:
Euro 14,000,000 - (Euro 16,000,000 - Euro 500,000) = (Euro 1,500,000); and
(2) if Closing Date Working Capital is Euro 18,000,000, then equation in (y)
above is: Euro 18,000,000 - (Euro 16,000,000 + Euro 500,000) = Euro
1,500,000); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)minus the Closing Sellers Expenses; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(the "Purchase Price"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tFor the sake of clarity, if the difference between the Closing Date
Working Capital and the Target Working Capital exceeds the Tolerance Amount
the increase or decrease, as the case may be, pursuant to item 0 above will be
limited to the excess and will not apply to the entire amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe Purchase Price will be subject to adjustment as provided for in

disclosed in any of the Schedules to this Agreement (except however Schedule
e) or Schedule f) which shall not be taken into account for the purposes
hereof);

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) to the extent the relevant Liability has already been accounted
for in the Closing Date Financial Debt or in the Closing Date Working Capital
for the purposes of determining the Provisional Purchase Price or the
Balance; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) in respect of any contingent or potential Liability of the Company
and the Subsidiaries, unless and until such Liability has become actual and
has been paid for by the Company and the Subsidiaries, provided however that
the Purchaser Indemnitees will be entitled to give a Claim Notice under
Section 10.4 even if the Liability is still not actual or incurred but only
potential and contingent, provided that the Sellers' indemnity obligations
will arise if and when the liability becomes actual and limited to the amount
of the actual Liability. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.3.2Deductions. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Subject to the provisions set forth in Subsection 10.3.1 above, the
amount of all indemnities payable by the Sellers to the Purchaser Indemnitees
pursuant to Section 10.1, shall be further reduced by: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\ti.the amount of any net decrease of any Tax that the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company and the Subsidiaries) has benefitted
or can actually benefit from for which such party would otherwise have been
accountable or liable to be assessed as a result any matter, fact or
circumstance giving rise to such indemnification obligation (it being
understood that any amount corresponding to the Tax savings which has
previously been indemnified by the Sellers pursuant to the provisions hereof
shall be promptly reimbursed to the Sellers); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tii.any provision ("fondo") recorded in the Financial Statements
relating to the event giving rise to indemnification; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tiii.the amount of any payment from third parties (whether insurance
companies or otherwise) that any of the Company or the Subsidiaries has
received in connection with the event giving rise to indemnification, it being
understood that any payment made by any such third party which has previously
been indemnified by the Sellers pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be
promptly reimbursed to the Sellers by the Purchaser Indemnitees up to the
maximum of the amount paid by the Sellers to the Purchaser Indemnitees; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)in no event will the deductions set forth above imply or result in
a duplication of payment(s) due by the Purchaser Indemnitees to the  \t\t

 \t\t

Sellers according to this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.3.3Limitations. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Subject to the provisions set forth in Subsections 10.3.1 and
10.3.2 above, the amount payable by the Sellers to the Purchaser pursuant to
Section 10.1 shall also be subject to the following limitations: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\ti.in the case of any Tax assessment that only results in the shifting
of the Tax burden from one fiscal year to another or in the shifting of the
Tax burden from one or more taxing jurisdictions to another one or more taxing
jurisdictions, any indemnification relating thereto shall be limited to the
actual net and final cash cost thereof to the Company or the
Subsidiaries; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tii.any indemnification due by the Sellers according to this Agreement
shall be computed without regard to any multiple, price-earnings or equivalent
ratio implicit in the negotiation and/or determination of the Purchase
Price; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tiii.in case the Sellers have indemnified the Purchaser for a Loss
suffered or incurred by any of the Company or the Subsidiaries, the
corresponding damage suffered by the Purchaser or by its controlling company
because of the diminished value of the participation will not constitute a
Loss to be indemnified; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tiv.any Liability of the Sellers for indemnification hereunder shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation or warranty. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.3.4Monetary thresholds. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Subject to the provisions set forth in Subsections 10.3.1, 10.3.2
and 10.3.3 above and subject to item (c) below, the Sellers will not be liable
pursuant to item (a) of Section 10.1: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\ti.if the amount due in connection with any single occurrence, or
series of related occurrences, giving rise to liability pursuant to item (a)
of Section 10.1 does not exceed Euro 20,000.00 (twenty thousand) (the "De
Minimis"); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tii.until the aggregate of all amounts that would otherwise be due
pursuant to item (a) of Section 10.1 exceeds Euro 200,000.00 (two hundred
thousand) (the "Floor"), provided however that any occurrence which is of a
value lower than the amount set forth in item i preceding will not be taken
into  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t65  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

account for the purposes of calculating the Floor and provided further that if
the Floor is exceeded, the Sellers' liability will be limited to the
excess; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tiii.in any event, subject to above and Section 4.2(c), the Sellers'
maximum aggregate liability (the "Cap") under item (a) of Section 10.1 shall
be limited to the maximum amount of Euro 3,000,000.00 (three million),
irrespective of the amount of the Loss suffered by the Purchaser
Indemnitees; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the De
Minimis, Floor or Cap will apply to Losses under items (b), (c) and (d) of
Section 10.1 above, provided that the Sellers' respective liability thereunder
will not exceed their Relevant Percentage of the Purchase Price, subject - in
respect to item (c) only - to Section 1229 of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, neither the De
Minimis nor the Floor will apply to Losses for breach of the representations
and warranties under Subsection 8.1.31 provided that the Sellers' liability
thereunder will be subject to the Cap. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.4Handling of Claims. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIf any event occurs which could give rise to Sellers' liability under
Section 10.1, the following provisions shall apply. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.4.1Purchaser Claims. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)As promptly as possible, and in any case within 30 Business Days
after the Purchaser first becomes aware of any event in respect of which
Sellers may be liable under Section 10.1 (a "Claim"), Purchaser will give
written notice ("Claim Notice") to the Sellers of such Claim; the Claim Notice
will provide all reasonable particulars thereof (including documents and
evidence, if any) and will specify all amounts the payment of which is
requested by Purchaser in connection therewith, to the extent known at the
time of the Claim Notice. Failure by the Purchaser to deliver a Claim Notice
within the aforesaid 30 Business Day term shall not relieve the Sellers from
their liability under Section 10.1, except to the extent the Sellers are
prejudiced thereby.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Upon receipt of a Claim Notice, the Sellers shall have 20 Business
Days in which to dispute the Claim asserted by sending written notice thereof
to the Purchaser (hereinafter, the "Dispute Notice"), provided however that
Seller's failure to send a Dispute Notice within such 20 Business Day period
shall be considered as a notice of disagreement by Sellers such that the
provisions set forth in paragraph (c) below will apply.  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t66  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)If (x) a Dispute Notice is timely received by Purchaser or (y)
Sellers fail to timely send a Dispute Notice to Purchaser, in each case as per
paragraph (b) above, for a period of 30 Business Days following (1) such
Dispute Notice (in the case under (x) above) or (2) the expiration of the 20
Business Day period contemplated by paragraph (b) above (in the case under (y)
above), the Parties will attempt to resolve any differences which they may
have with respect to the matters indicated in the Dispute Notice and Claim
Notice. Upon resolving in writing the dispute in whole or in part, the
relevant Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to receive the amounts agreed
upon in the manner set forth in Section 10.6. If, at the end of such 30
Business Day period, the Sellers and the Purchaser fail to reach an agreement
in writing with respect to all the matters indicated in the Dispute Notice and
Claim Notice, then all matters as to which agreement is not so reached may,
thereafter, be submitted to arbitration pursuant to Section 12.11. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.4.2Third Parties' Claims. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)In case the Claim Notice regards a claim, action, suit or
proceeding asserted or initiated against the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries by a Third Party (a "Third Party Claim"), following the Closing,
Purchaser shall control the defense of any such Third Party Claim. Sellers
may, at their sole cost and expense, participate, with counsel of their
choosing, reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, in the defense of any Third
Party Claim that is the subject matter of a Claim Notice to the Sellers under
Subsection 10.4.1 preceding. In such case, Purchaser's counsel will consult
with Sellers' counsel in relation to the strategy for the defense and they
will cooperate in good faith to the defense of such Third Party Claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Without prejudice to paragraph (a) preceding, Purchaser shall
properly and diligently defend, or shall cause the Company or the relevant
Subsidiary, as the case may be, to properly and diligently defend, any Third
Party Claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Without prejudice to paragraphs (a) and (b) preceding, none of the
Purchaser, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries shall make or accept any
settlement of or acquiesce to such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Sellers, which shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)If a firm offer is made to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
or to the Purchaser to settle any Third Party Claim giving rise to the
Sellers' liability under this Article 10 which the Sellers, but not the
Purchaser, are willing to accept, the Purchaser and/or the  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t67  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

Company or the relevant Subsidiary (as the case may be) shall be free not to
enter into such settlement and to commence or continue litigation, at its own
expense, but the Sellers's liability under Section 10.1 shall be limited to
the amount of the proposed settlement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.5Amnesty. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tIn the event that - at any time between the Closing Date and the date
upon which the liability of Sellers for Taxes or social security matters shall
expire pursuant to Subsection 10.3.1 - any Law or Order should be enacted in
Italy or in any other relevant jurisdiction having as an effect the right to
settle, in whole or in part, Tax and/or social security obligations of the
Company or the Subsidiaries covered by Sellers' indemnity obligation hereunder
(any such Law or Order is hereinafter referred to as an "Amnesty" and it will,
in particular - but without limitation - refer to what is commonly known as
"condono" in Italian Tax Law and politics), the following provisions shall
apply: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Sellers shall have the right (but not the duty) to request
Purchaser that the Company or any of the Subsidiaries avails itself of the
Amnesty. If Sellers communicate that they consider making such a request,
Purchaser shall cause the Company or the relevant Subsidiary to deliver all
information to Sellers that is needed to make a fully informed decision about
making the Amnesty request; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Purchaser shall have the right to determine, in its sole discretion
(irrespective of any request of Sellers under paragraph (a) preceding),
whether or not the Company or the relevant Subsidiary should avail itself of
the Amnesty; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)if Purchaser elects to proceed with an Amnesty without the prior
written agreement (which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld) or
written request of Sellers, all costs and expenses of such Amnesty shall be
borne by Purchaser or by the Company or by the relevant Subsidiary, without
recourse against Sellers hereunder; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)if Purchaser elects to proceed with an Amnesty in written agreement
with Sellers or pursuant to Sellers' request hereunder, all costs and expenses
of such Amnesty relating to Tax Periods Before Closing Date shall be borne by
Sellers; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)if Purchaser elects not to proceed with an Amnesty notwithstanding
Sellers' request pursuant to paragraph (a) preceding, it shall be free to do
so, but Sellers' liability under Section 10.1 in respect of the matter
constituting the subject of such Amnesty shall be limited to the amount that
would have  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t68  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

been paid by Sellers pursuant to paragraph (c) preceding had Purchaser elected
to proceed with the Amnesty in accordance with Sellers request. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.6Escrow \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)In accordance with the Escrow Agreement, any payments due by
Sellers to Purchaser pursuant to the Sellers' indemnification obligations
under Subsection 10.1(a) shall be paid out of the Escrow Amount. Purchaser
shall therefore be entitled to make a claim against the Escrow Amount
according to the Escrow Agreement and pursuant to the terms and conditions
stipulated therein, provided that any payment due by Sellers in connection
with their indemnification obligation under Subsection 10.1(a) of this
Agreement up to the Escrow Amount (or the lower amount from time to time
available under the Escrow Agreement) shall only be paid out of the Escrow
Amount by the Escrow Agent according to the Escrow Agreement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Purchaser may, but will not be required to, seek payment of any
amount due by Sellers to Purchaser pursuant to the Sellers' indemnification
obligations under Subsections 10.1(b), 10.1(c) or 10.1(d) out of the Escrow
Amount. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)The Escrow Amount shall be released to Sellers or the Purchaser in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)The Escrow Agreement will remain in place until the earlier of the
Fund's Term (including any extension) or l8 months after the Closing, except
if by that time there is any pending claim under the Escrow Agreement, in
which case the Escrow Agreement will remain in place and the Escrow Amount
will not be released until such pending claim has been fully paid.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.7Payments. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)To the extent that the Purchaser has claims pursuant to Subsection
10.1(b), 10.1(c) or 10.1(d) and there are not sufficient funds held in escrow
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to satisfy the Purchaser\'s claims, or the
Escrow Agreement is no longer in place as per Section 10.6 or Purchaser elects
not to seek recourse from the Escrow Amount, then the Purchaser may enforce
its indemnification rights provided for under this Agreement directly against
the Sellers, it being understood that the Escrow Amount does not limit the
obligations of the Sellers with regards to claims pursuant to Subsections
10.1(b), 10.1(c) or 10.1(d).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)In the case contemplated by paragraph (a) above, the Sellers will
pay the amounts due to the relevant Purchaser Indemnitee  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t69  \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

through wire transfer of funds to the bank account designated by such
Purchaser Indemnitee, such wire transfer to be effected within 5 (five)
Business Days from the date in which the relevant indemnity obligations have
become due and payable based on the provisions of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.8Severability. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Any payment required to be made by Sellers under this Agreement and
specifically under this Article 10 shall be divided among Sellers according to
the Relevant Percentage. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Each of Sellers shall be severally and not jointly liable vis-a-vis
Purchaser for any payment under this Agreement (including but not limited to
the provisions under this Article 10). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Padovani and Zannoni (but not Star and Gazzaniga) shall be
severally and not jointly liable vis-a-vis Purchaser for any breaches or
inaccuracies of the obligations, representations and warranties set forth
under Section 5.4(c), Section 6.4(a), Section 7.3, Section 7.4, Section
7.5 and Section 7.6.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.9Cooperation \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe Purchaser shall cooperate, and shall cause the Company and the
Subsidiaries to cooperate, with the Sellers with respect to resolving any
claim or liability with respect to which the Sellers may be obligated to
indemnify a Purchaser Indemnitee hereunder, including by making commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.10Applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThis Agreement, including all Schedules, and the agreements, documents

construed and interpreted in accordance with the substantive Laws of Italy
(with the exclusion of any conflict-of-laws rules). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Any controversy, dispute or claim arising under or in connection
with this Agreement (including in relation to the existence, validity,
interpretation, performance, breach, termination or enforceability hereof)
shall be exclusively resolved by a binding arbitration under the Rules of the
Chamber of Arbitration of Milan - Camera Arbitrale Nazionale e Internazionale

 \t\t

arbitrator as per paragraph (c) below. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)The panel of arbitrators will be composed of three members to be
appointed as follows: each Party will appoint one arbitrator; the two
arbitrators appointed by the Parties will then appoint a third arbitrator who
shall chair the panel (and who may be of Italian nationality), provided
however that, failing such two arbitrators to agree on the designation of the
third arbitrator within 10 Business Days of the appointment of the later of
such two arbitrators, or should a party fail to appoint its arbitrator within
10 Business Days of the notice commencing the arbitration proceedings, such
appointments will be made pursuant to the Rules. Any arbitrator appointed by
the other two arbitrators or by the Chamber of Arbitration of Milan - Camera
Arbitrale Nazionale e Internazionale di Milano shall be: (x) an experienced
arbitrator of disputes arising out of large, complex commercial transactions;
(y) an Italian qualified lawyer who is fluent in English; and (z)
unaffiliated, and without prior or current financial alliances or
affiliations, with any Party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)The arbitrators shall resolve the dispute "in via rituale secondo
diritto" pursuant to the substantive Laws of Italy, without regard to conflict
of law rules. The venue of the arbitration shall be Milan, Italy, and the
arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English, in which regard all
arbitrators shall be fluent in the English language. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the arbitration proceedings. In the award, the arbitrators
shall finally allocate the arbitration fees, costs and expenses between the
Parties and, where necessary, shall order either one of the Parties to
promptly reimburse the other Party for those advances paid by the latter (if
any) which are in excess of such Party's share of such fees, costs and
expenses as finally allocated in the award. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)The award will be final and binding to the Parties and not subject
to appeal or judicial review. The Parties reserve the right to seek
provisional or conservatory measures and injunctive relief from courts of
competent jurisdiction in connection with matters submitted to arbitration
pursuant hereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g)Without prejudice to paragraphs (a) to (f) above, the Parties
hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Milan, Italy, in
respect of any dispute which under mandatory provisions of Italian Law cannot
be referred to an arbitration panel but which however concerns this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t12.12Counterparts.  \t\t
