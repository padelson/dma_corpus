shall require the consent of any other party (or in the event that any of the
same shall be non-assignable), neither this Agreement nor any action taken
pursuant to its provisions shall constitute an assignment or an agreement to
assign if such assignment or attempted assignment would constitute a breach
thereof or result in the loss or diminution thereof; provided, however, that in
each such case, Sellers and Nextera shall each use their commercially reasonable
efforts, and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers and Nextera, to
obtain the consent of such other party to an assignment to Buyer; provided, that
neither Nextera nor any of Sellers will be required to pay any consent fees,
commence any litigation or make any other concessions to any person in order to

                                      -5-

<PAGE>

     (vi) any Seller Plan Liabilities that are not Assumed Employment
     Liabilities; (vii) any Liabilities, other than Assumed Employment
     Liabilities, that arise under Sellers' non-compete and employment
     agreements with Daniel Fischel, Dennis Carlton, Joseph Kalt and Jerry
     Hausman and any other employee of Sellers or Nextera, including, without
     limitation, any and all non-compete payments payable thereunder and the

                                 PURCHASE PRICE

     Section 3.2. Payment. At the Closing:

          (a) Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount set forth in Section 3.1(b),
     less the Escrow Amount and less any Estimated Working Capital Discrepancy
     Amount required pursuant to the last phrase of Section 3.5(d) (such net
     amount, the "Cash Closing Amount"), in immediately available cash funds by
     wire transfer to an account designated by Sellers at least five (5) days
     prior to the Closing; provided that the Cash Closing Amount shall be
     reduced by the amount paid by Buyer, on behalf of Sellers and Nextera, to
     repay and discharge in full the Indebtedness of Sellers referenced in
     clauses (i), (ii), (iv) and (viii) of the definition of Indebtedness.

          (b) Buyer shall deposit the Escrow Amount into a third party escrow

                                      -6-

<PAGE>

          (c) Buyer shall pay to Sellers the Medical Plan Payment in immediately
     available cash funds by wire transfer to an account designated by Sellers
     at least five (5) days prior to the Closing.

     Section 3.3. Purchase Price Allocation. The parties hereby agree that the
Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Assets and Assumed Liabilities in the
manner agreed to by the Parties in writing prior to the Closing Date. The
Parties covenant and agree to file all federal, state, local and foreign tax
returns in accordance with such allocations and to report the Closing as a
taxable transaction.

     Section 3.4. Transfer Taxes. All transfer, gains, sales, bulk sales, use
and similar conveyance Taxes imposed by reason of the transactions contemplated
hereby and any deficiency, interest or penalty asserted with respect thereto
shall be paid in accordance with local law and custom.

     Section 3.5. Closing Balance Sheet; Accounts Receivable; Escrow Amount.

          (a) Sellers have delivered to FTI and Buyer a schedule of Sellers'
     consolidated Working Capital for the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2001
     through June 30, 2003 (the "Working Capital Schedule"). The Working Capital
     Schedule has been prepared by Sellers in good faith, in accordance with
     GAAP on a pro forma basis from the books and records of Sellers, fairly
     presents in all material respects the consolidated Working Capital of
     Sellers for the time periods indicated and excludes the Excluded
     Liabilities.

          (b) No later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
     shall (i) prepare and deliver to Buyer an estimated consolidated balance
     sheet of Sellers dated as of the estimated date of Closing (the "Estimated
     Closing Balance Sheet") and a calculation of Sellers' estimated Working
     Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Closing Working Capital"),
     (ii) designate in writing the accounts receivable from one or more of the
     customers listed on Schedule 13.12 that shall be "Withheld Receivables"
     hereunder and (iii) designate in writing the amount of such Withheld
     Receivables. Following delivery of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and
     Sellers' Withheld Receivables designations, Buyer will have the right to
     make reasonable inquiries regarding the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and
     the amount of Sellers' Withheld Receivables, and Sellers shall use
     commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Closing Date to provide to
     Buyer such additional information and answers to such inquiries. The
     Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in good faith in
     accordance with GAAP on a pro forma basis in a manner consistent with the
     Working Capital Schedule and shall represent Sellers' good faith estimate
     of the assets and liabilities of the Business to be transferred to Buyer at
     the Closing and fairly present in all material respects the estimated
     financial position of such Business as of the Closing Date. The calculation
     of Estimated Closing Working Capital shall be made in good faith based on
     the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet.

          (c) Following the Closing, subject to Section 3.5(d) below, Buyer
     shall notify each client with accounts receivable designated by Sellers as
     Withheld Receivables and

                                      -7-

<PAGE>

     instruct such client to pay and deliver the Withheld Receivables to Nextera
     or Sellers in the manner reasonably requested by Sellers and shall promptly
     (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) forward to Nextera the
     amount of any Withheld Receivables received by Buyer following such
     instructions.

          (d) If the Estimated Closing Working Capital is less than Six Million,
     Five Hundred Twenty-Two Thousand, Eight Hundred Dollars ($6,522,800) (the
     "Working Capital Target"), then accounts receivable equal to the amount by
     which the Working Capital Target exceeds the Estimated Closing Working
     Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital Discrepancy Amount") shall be
     deducted from the Withheld Receivables (by transferring such Receivables to
     Buyer at Closing) until exhausted and then from the Purchase Price, not to
     exceed the Estimated Working Capital Discrepancy Amount in the aggregate.
     Solely for the purpose of determining the Estimated Closing Working Capital
     and the Closing Working Capital, the Parties agree that an amount equal to
     one-half (1/2) of the Seller Plan Payments shall be deemed to be a Current
     Liability and included in the calculation of Estimated Closing Working
     Capital and the Closing Working Capital under this Section 3.5.

          (e) During the one hundred twenty (120)-day period immediately
     following the Closing Date (the "Collection Review Period"), FTI shall:

               (i) (A) use its commercially reasonable efforts to collect all
     accounts receivable represented on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet as
     accounts receivable or as revenues earned on the date of the Estimated
     Closing Balance Sheet but not invoiced by Sellers on such date, provided,
     however that neither FTI nor Buyer shall be required to pay any fees,
     commence any litigation or make any other concessions to any person in
     performing such activities, and (B) provide notice to Sellers of any
     determination by FTI or Buyer that any accounts receivable represented on
     the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet are uncollectible, any such
     determination to be made by Buyer acting in good faith; and

               (ii) during the first sixty (60) days of the Collection Review
     Period, cause its employees or Ernst & Young LLP to prepare and deliver to
     Nextera and Sellers (i) an actual consolidated balance sheet of Sellers as
     of the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet") prepared in good
     faith in accordance with GAAP on a pro forma basis in a manner consistent
     with the Working Capital Schedule and the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet,
     which shall represent FTI's and Buyer's good faith estimate of the assets
     and liabilities of the Business as of the Closing Date and fairly present
     in all material respects the financial position of such Business as of the
     Closing Date, (ii) a calculation of Sellers' Working Capital as of the
     Closing Date (the "Closing Working Capital"), which shall be determined in
     good faith based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and (iii) a calculation
     of the Closing Working Capital Discrepancy Amount (if any) or the
     Discrepancy Repayment (if any), each determined in good faith in accordance
     with Section 3.5(f).

          (f) If the sum of the Closing Working Capital plus the Estimated
     Working Capital Discrepancy Amount (if any) is less than the Working
     Capital Target, then Sellers

                                      -8-

<PAGE>

     and Buyer shall make a joint instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver to
     Buyer such portion of the Escrow Amount as is equal to the amount by which
     the sum of the Closing Working Capital plus the Estimated Working Capital
     Discrepancy Amount (if any) is less than the Working Capital Target (the
     "Closing Working Capital Discrepancy Amount"). If the Closing Working
     Capital exceeds the Working Capital Target, Buyer shall immediately repay
     to Sellers any Estimated Working Capital Discrepancy Amount deducted
     pursuant to Section 3.5(d) (the "Discrepancy Repayment") in immediately
     available cash funds by wire transfer to the account designated by Sellers
     under Section 3.2(a).

          (g) At the end of the Collection Review Period, FTI and Buyer shall
     make and deliver to Nextera and Sellers a determination of the amount of
     the specific accounts receivable represented on the Estimated Closing
     Balance Sheet (such accounts receivables represented on the Estimated
     Closing Date Balance Sheet being the "Base Receivables") that remain
     uncollected at the end of the Collection Review Period and that FTI and
     Buyer determine, acting in good faith, to be still collectible (the
     "Collectible Accounts Receivable Determination"). Thereafter:

          (i) if (D + E) is less than (A - B - C) [with such factors as defined
          below], then, unless Nextera or Sellers dispute any portion of such
          Collectible Accounts Receivable Determination in accordance with
          Section 3.5(h), Sellers and Buyer shall make a joint instruction to
          the Escrow Agent (or either Party may submit the Accounting Referee
          determination, as the case may be) to deliver to Buyer such portion of
          the Escrow Amount as is equal to the dollar amount (not to exceed the
          balance of the Escrow Account) by which (D + E) is less than (A - B -
          C); and

          (ii) if (D + E) is greater than or equal to (A - B - C), then Buyer
          and FTI shall not be entitled to receive any amounts from the Escrow
          Account with respect to the collectibility or uncollectibility of the
          Base Receivables;

     in each of (i) and (ii) above, where:

          A = Aggregate amount of Base Receivables;

          B = Specific reserves set forth on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
          with respect to the Base Receivables;

          C = General reserve for doubtful accounts set forth on the Estimated
          Closing Balance Sheet;

          D = Aggregate collections with respect to the Base Receivables during
          the Collection Review Period; and

          E = Aggregate amount of not yet collected Base Receivables for which
          Buyer and FTI have made a Collectible Accounts Receivable
          Determination.

          By way of example only, if at the Closing, A = $21,000,000, B =
     $2,000,000 and C = $1,000,000, and if at the end of the Collection Review
     Period D = $15,000,000 and

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

     E = $4,000,000, then D + E = $19,000,000, and A - B - C = $18,000,000, then
     Buyer and FTI shall not be entitled to receive any amounts from the Escrow
     Account with respect to the collectibility or uncollectibility of the Base
     Receivables.

          (h) If Nextera or Sellers in good faith disagree with (i) the
     Collectible Accounts Receivable Determination or (ii) any portion of the
     Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing Working Capital, the Closing
     Working Capital Discrepancy Amount (if any) or the Discrepancy Repayment
     (if any), then Sellers may until ten (10) Business Days after receipt of
     the Collectible Accounts Receivable Determination (in the case of a
     disagreement related to the Collectible Accounts Receivable Determination)
     or the Closing Date Balance Sheet (in the case of a disagreement related to
     the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Closing Working Capital, the Closing
     Working Capital Discrepancy Amount (if any) or the Discrepancy Repayment
     (if any)), deliver a written notice to FTI setting forth in reasonable
     detail its disagreement and the basis of such a disagreement. If no such
     notice of disagreement is timely delivered, then any Collectible Accounts
     Receivable Determination, on the one hand, and/or the Closing Date Balance
     Sheet, Closing Working Capital, the Closing Working Capital Discrepancy
     Amount (if any) and the Discrepancy Repayment (if any), on the other hand,
     shall be final and binding on the Parties hereto.

          (i) If a notice of disagreement shall be timely delivered pursuant to
     Section 3.5(h), then Nextera and FTI shall, during the ten (10) Business
     Days following such delivery, use commercially reasonable efforts to seek
     in good faith to reach agreement on the disputed items. If such an
     agreement is reached during this period, the Parties' agreement regarding
     any Collectible Accounts Receivable Determination, on the one hand, and/or
     the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Working Capital, the Closing
     Working Capital Discrepancy Amount (if any) or the Discrepancy Repayment
     (if any), on the other hand, shall be final and binding on the Parties. If
     Nextera and FTI are unable to reach such agreement, the New York City
     office of BDO Seidman (the "Accounting Referee") shall be retained to
     review promptly this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts. In
     connection therewith, the Accounting Referee shall promptly review this
     Agreement and shall consider only those items or amounts in dispute. The
     Accounting Referee shall deliver to Nextera and FTI as promptly as
     practicable, and within thirty (30) days after being referred the matter, a
     report setting forth its adjustments (if any) to any Collectible Accounts
     Receivable Determination and/or the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing
     Working Capital, the Closing Working Capital Discrepancy Amount (if any) or
     the Discrepancy Repayment (if any), as applicable, and the calculations
     supporting such determinations. The Collectible Accounts Receivable
     Determination and/or the Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Working
     Capital, the Closing Working Capital Discrepancy Amount (if any) or the
     Discrepancy Repayment (if any), each as adjusted pursuant to such report
     shall be final and binding on the Parties hereto and shall be submitted to
     the Escrow Agent with specific instructions from the Accounting Referee to
     release funds from the escrow account, the amount of such funds and the
     Party to receive such funds. The non-prevailing Party shall pay the fees
     and expenses of the Accounting Referee; provided, however, that in the
     event of a compromise between the positions of the Parties, such fees and
     expenses shall be prorated based on the relative success of the Parties in
     prevailing on their respective positions.

                                      -10-

          (j) Buyer agrees that it shall have no recourse for any amounts under
     Sections 3.5(f), (g), (h), or (i) in excess of the Escrow Amount, and
     Buyer's only source for any such recourse shall be against the Escrow
     Amount in accordance with this Section 3.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
     Nextera and Sellers acknowledge that nothing in this Section 3.5(j) shall
     limit Buyer's rights under Article XI for breaches of Nextera's and
     Sellers' representations and warranties contained in Article V.

          (k) Upon the expiration of the Collection Review Period, all amounts
     remaining in the escrow account that are not the subject of a formal
     dispute initiated in accordance with this Section 3.5 shall be delivered by
     the Escrow Agent to Nextera.

     Section 3.6. Accounts Receivable and Prepaid Expenses.

          (a) Set forth in Schedule 3.6 is a schedule of the accounts receivable
     and prepaid expenses as of June 30, 2003, specifying the names of each
     account, the dates of incurrence, the face amounts thereof and, in the case
     of the accounts receivable, the amount of any reserve Sellers have allotted
     for each such account, if any.

              REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF NEXTERA AND SELLERS

     Each of the Sellers and Nextera hereby jointly and severally represent and
warrant to Buyer and FTI as follows:

validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Illinois.
Each of Nextera, CE and

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

ERG is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware. Nextera owns 100% of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Lexecon. Lexecon owns 100% of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of each of CE and ERG. There are no outstanding
options, warrants, rights, commitments, preemptive rights or agreements of any
kind for the issuance and sale or rights convertible into additional equity of
any class or kind of Sellers. Each of the Sellers and Nextera has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
conduct the Business as now being conducted. Each of the Sellers and Nextera are
duly qualified to do business and are in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the nature of the business conducted by them or the property they own,
lease or operate requires any of them to qualify to do business as a foreign
corporation except where the failure to so qualify would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. Set forth on Schedule 5.1 is a list of each jurisdiction in
which both Sellers and Nextera are qualified to do business. Except as set forth
on Schedule 5.1, none of Sellers nor Nextera has received any written notice or
assertion within the last three years from any governmental official of any
jurisdiction to the effect that any of Sellers or Nextera is required to be
qualified or otherwise authorized to do business therein, in which any of
Sellers or Nextera has not qualified or obtained such authorization. Each of the
Sellers and Nextera have previously delivered to FTI complete and correct copies
of Sellers' and Nextera's Certificates of Incorporation and all amendments
thereto as of the date hereof, and their By-laws, as in effect on the date
hereof (together, the "Formation Documents"), and none of Sellers nor Nextera
are in default in the performance, observation or fulfillment of any provision
of any such Formation Documents.

     Section 5.2. Authorization of Sellers.

          (a) Each of the Sellers and Nextera has the full legal right, power
     and all authority to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement, to
     perform fully its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
     contemplated hereby. Except for Nextera Stockholder Approval, all necessary
     and appropriate corporate action has been taken by Sellers and Nextera with
     respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance
     of their respective obligations hereunder and no other proceedings on the
     part of any of Sellers or Nextera is necessary to approve the Agreement or
     the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby
     and thereby.

          (b) The only vote required of the holders of any class or series of
     Nextera's capital stock or other equity interests necessary to adopt this
     Agreement and to approve the transactions contemplated hereby is the
     approval of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
     outstanding Nextera Stock (the "Nextera Stockholder Approval").

          (c) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
     each of the Sellers and Nextera and constitutes, and the documents to be
     executed and delivered at the Closing, when executed and delivered by each
     of the Sellers and Nextera, will constitute, valid and binding obligations
     of Sellers and Nextera, enforceable against each of them in accordance with
     their terms, subject to enforceability against Buyer and FTI and the effect
     of applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or similar
     laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to the effect of
     general principles of equity, including, without limitation, the possible
     unavailability of specific

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

     performance or injunctive relief, regardless of whether considered in a
     proceeding in equity or at law.

     Section 5.3. Financial Statements.

          (a) The annual consolidated financial statements of Nextera set forth
     in its most recent Form 10-K filing with the SEC and the interim
     consolidated financial statements of Nextera set forth in filings with the
     SEC since the filing of its most recent Form 10-K, along with the following
     financial statements of the Business, which have been previously furnished
     to Buyer by Nextera are true, correct and complete in all material
     respects, have been prepared from and are in accordance with the books and
     records of Sellers and Nextera and its subsidiaries and have been prepared
     in conformity with GAAP applied using an accrual basis method, and fairly
     present the financial condition of Sellers and the Business as of the dates
     stated and the results of operations and cash flows of Sellers and the
     Business for the periods then ended in accordance with such practices: (i)
     the audited balance sheet of Lexecon as of December 31, 2002, and the
     related consolidated statements of operations, cash flow and stockholders'
     equity of Sellers for the year then ended, (ii) the audited balance sheet
     of Nextera as of December 31, 2001, and 2002, and the related consolidated

     Schedule 5.3 (the "June Balance Sheet"), and the related statement of

     the Business represents Sellers' and Nextera's best estimate of the assets
     and liabilities of the Business to be transferred to Buyer pursuant to this
     Agreement and fairly presents in all material respects the financial
     position of such Business as of June 30, 2003, and was prepared in all
     material respects from and is in accordance with the books and records of
     Sellers, Nextera and its subsidiaries and was prepared in accordance with
     GAAP using an accrual basis method other than footnotes required by GAAP
     and year-end audit adjustments. There are no material liabilities or
     obligations, whether contingent or absolute, direct or indirect, or matured
     or unmatured, of the Business which are not shown or provided for in the
     June Balance Sheet.

     Section 5.4. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth on
Schedule 5.4, since the Balance Sheet Date, there has not been any material
adverse effect on the business, operations, results of operations, assets,
properties or financial condition of the Business; excluding (i) the failure of
any of the employees of Sellers other than those listed on Schedule 7.6 to
accept employment with the Buyer or FTI or (ii) the effect of any delisting of
the capital stock of Nextera from the Nasdaq SmallCap Stock Market ("Material
Adverse Effect"). Nextera has not declared, set aside or paid any dividend or
other distribution (whether in cash, securities or property or any combination
thereof) in respect of any class, redemption or series of its capital stock or
other equity interests. In addition to the foregoing, none of Sellers nor
Nextera have:

     any stock option or right to purchase shares of capital stock of Sellers or
     Nextera; issued any security convertible into such capital stock; granted

complied and is in compliance with all material applicable laws, statutes,
orders, rules, regulations, policies or guidelines promulgated, or material
judgments, decisions or orders entered, by any federal, state, local or foreign
court or Governmental Authority or instrumentality relating to the Business
(collectively, the "Applicable Laws"). Schedule 1.1(f) contains a complete and

          (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.8, to the Knowledge of Sellers
     and Nextera, other than those Proprietary Rights listed on Schedule 1.1(g),
     no Proprietary Right is used in or is necessary for the operation of the
     Business as the same is currently conducted. To the Knowledge of Sellers
     and Nextera, the Business, as conducted prior to the Closing, and the sale
     by Sellers, and ownership by Buyer of any of the Assets, was not, is not
     and will not be in contravention of any trade name, service mark, patent,
     trademark, copyright or other proprietary right of any third party.

     produces, uses, licenses or sells, which indemnification

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

     will be assumed by Buyer; to the Knowledge of Sellers or Nextera, no
     product, process, method or operation presently sold, engaged in or
     employed by Sellers or Nextera in connection with the Business infringes
     upon any rights owned by any other person, firm, corporation or other legal
     entity; to the Knowledge of Sellers or Nextera, there is not pending or
     threatened any claim or Litigation against any of the Sellers or Nextera
     contesting the right of any of the Sellers or Nextera to sell, engage in or
     employ with respect to the Business any such product, process, method, or
     operation; and there is not, to the Knowledge of Sellers and Nextera,
     pending, proposed or threatened, any patent, copyright, trade name,
     trademark, service mark, invention, device, application or principle which,

any notice from any such insurer with respect to the cancellation of any such

and effect up to the Closing. All premiums due and payable on such policies have
been paid. Except as disclosed on said Schedule, none of Sellers nor Nextera is
a co-insurer or self-insurer under any term of any insurance policy. The
policies listed on Schedule 5.9 as "occurrence" provide coverage on an
"occurrence basis" which includes any "occurrence" arising from Sellers'
operations up to and through the Closing. With respect to policies listed as
"claims made" Sellers or Nextera is provided coverage, and for the period of any
"tail coverage" purchased by Sellers or Nextera claims can be brought for
wrongful acts occurring during the period Sellers were subsidiaries of Nextera.

     Section 5.10. Bank Accounts, Depositories, Powers of Attorney. Schedule
5.10 is a true, correct and complete list of the names and locations of all
banks or other depositories in which are located cash or cash equivalents of

          (b) The Assets constitute all of the property now used in and
     necessary for the conduct of the Business as presently conducted.

     to actually acquire such securities or approve any matter for purposes of
     Section 203 of the DGCL with respect to any Person (for the avoidance of
     doubt, a waiver or release under such agreement that solely permits a
     proposal or offer, including, without limitation, an Acquisition Proposal,

     provided, however, that, without limiting what changes may be material, any
     change in the form, amount, timing or other aspects of the consideration to
     be paid

                                      -32-

     withdrawal, modification, amendment, condition or qualification of the
     Nextera Recommendation for purposes of this Section 7.4) and (B) unless
     Nextera's Board of Directors has previously withdrawn, or is concurrently
     therewith withdrawing, the Nextera Recommendation in accordance with this
     Section 7.4, Nextera's Board of Directors shall not recommend any
     Acquisition Proposal to the Nextera Stockholders. Nothing contained in this
     Section 7.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall (i) prevent Nextera's
     Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
     with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or making any disclosure required
     by applicable law or (ii) prohibit accurate disclosure of factual
     information regarding the business, financial condition or results of
     operations of Nextera or Sellers, or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal
     has been made, the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal
     or the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal to the extent such
     information, facts, identity or terms are required to be disclosed under
     applicable law.

     unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, Nextera may, subject to compliance with
     all the other provisions of this Section 7.4, furnish information to and
     engage in discussions and negotiations with the Person making such offer
     with respect to its Acquisition Proposal ("Permitted Actions"); provided
     that prior to engaging in any Permitted Actions (A) Nextera's Board of
     Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
     counsel and outside financial advisors, that, as a result of such
     Acquisition Proposal, such Permitted Action is necessary for Nextera's
     Board of Directors to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties
     under applicable law, (B) Nextera shall receive from such Person an
     executed confidentiality agreement on terms that are not materially less
     favorable to Nextera and Sellers than the Confidentiality Agreement, (C)

     (but in no event later than the third Business Day) of its engaging in any
     Permitted Actions. Nextera shall keep Buyer informed, on a current basis,
     of the status of any material negotiations, discussions and documents with
     respect to such Acquisition Proposal or request.

               (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 7.4(a), as a result of
     a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of Nextera may withdraw or

     Nextera has complied in all material respects with this Section 7.4 and

     contrary, at any time prior to obtaining Nextera Stockholder Approval, the
     Board of Directors of Nextera may, in response to a Superior Proposal that
     was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a breach of this
     Section 7.4, cause Sellers to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
     12.1(c)(ii) and concurrently enter into an agreement regarding such
     Superior Proposal; provided, however, that neither Nextera nor Sellers
     shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1(c)(ii), and any
     purported termination pursuant to Section 12.1(c)(ii) shall be void and of
     no force or effect (and Nextera or Sellers may not enter into such
     agreement regarding such Superior Proposal), unless Sellers and Nextera
     shall have complied in all material respects with all the provisions of
     this Section 7.4, including the notification provisions in this Section
     7.4, and with all applicable requirements of Section 12.2(c) prior to or
     concurrently with such termination) in connection with such Superior
     Proposal; and provided further, that Nextera shall not exercise its right
     to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1(c)(ii) until after the
     second Business Day following the date notice is given to Buyer in
     accordance with Section 13.1 (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") from Nextera
     advising Buyer that the Board of Directors of Nextera has received a
     Superior Proposal, (i) specifying the material terms and conditions of the
     Superior Proposal, (ii) identifying the Person making such Superior
     Proposal and (iii) stating that the Board of Directors of Nextera intends
     to exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section

     term of a Superior Proposal (such amended Superior Proposal, a "Modified
     Superior Proposal") shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a
     new two Business Day period with respect to such Modified Superior
     Proposal).

               (iv) Immediately upon the execution of this Agreement, Nextera
     shall cease, and shall cause any Person acting on its behalf to cease, and
     cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any
     Person conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing and shall
     request any such parties in possession of confidential information about

Agreement, (b) any event, occurrence, transaction or other item which would have
been required to have been disclosed on any schedule or statement delivered
hereunder had such event, occurrence, transaction or item existed on the date
hereof, other than items arising in the ordinary course of business which would
not render any representation or warranty of Sellers or Nextera materially
misleading.

to Closing, Sellers shall obtain "occurrence based" professional liability
insurance coverage or "tail" insurance from a carrier reasonably acceptable to

     indemnification under Section 11.2 hereof shall have been given within the
     applicable survival period, the representations and warranties that are the
     subject of such indemnification claim shall survive until such time as such
     claim is finally resolved.

     warranty or covenant contained in any Section of this Agreement shall
     include the schedule relating to such Section.

          (c) Unless a specified period is set forth in this Agreement (in which
     event such specified period will control) the covenants contained herein
     will survive the Closing and remain in effect indefinitely.

     and all amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation
     (collectively, "Damages"), asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or
     incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party, directly or
     indirectly, as a result of or arising from the following (collectively,

          (b) Damages shall be determined without regard to whether or not,
     apart from the Seller Indemnifiable Claim with respect to such Damages, the
     transactions provided for in this Agreement prove generally to be favorable
     to Buyer and without regard to whether or not the facts and circumstances
     covered by any representation, warranty or covenant prove to be more
     favorable to Buyer than so represented, warranted or covenanted.
     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is hereby
     agreed that solely for the purposes of the calculation of Damages pursuant
     to this Article XI, all materiality and Material Adverse Effect exceptions

          (b) Damages shall be determined without regard to whether or not,
     apart from the Buyer Indemnifiable Claim with respect to such Damages, the
     transactions provided for in this Agreement prove generally to be favorable
     to Seller and without regard to whether or not the facts and circumstances
     covered by any representation, warranty or covenant prove to be more
     favorable to Seller than so represented, warranted or covenanted.
     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is hereby
     agreed that solely for the purposes of the calculation of Damages pursuant

     Section 11.4. Limitations on Indemnification. Rights to indemnification
hereunder are subject to the following limitations:

          (a) The Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder
     with respect to a Seller Indemnifiable Claim or Buyer Indemnifiable Claim,
     as the case may be (either of a Seller Indemnifiable Claim or Buyer
     Indemnifiable Claim, as the case may be, an "Indemnifiable Claim") (or, if
     more than one Indemnifiable Claim is asserted, with respect to all
     Indemnifiable Claims) unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect
     to such Indemnifiable Claim or Claims exceeds One Million Dollars
     ($1,000,000), in which event the indemnity provided for in Section 11.2 or
     11.3 hereof shall be effective with respect to Indemnifiable Claims in
     excess of such Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) amount (the
     "Floor"). Additionally, a claim shall not be considered an Indemnifiable
     Claim unless it individually (along with related claims) exceeds
     Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000). The foregoing One Million Dollars
     ($1,000,000) aggregate deductible amount and the Twenty-Five Thousand
     Dollars ($25,000) individual claim amount shall not be applicable and shall
     not limit any indemnification sought with respect to claims asserted by
     third parties. In no event shall the indemnification obligation of Sellers
     or Nextera arising under this Article XI exceed an amount equal to
     Sixty-Five Million Dollars ($65,000,000) in the aggregate. In no event
     shall the indemnification obligation of Buyer arising under this Article XI
     exceed Thirteen Million Dollars ($13,000,000) in the aggregate.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the limitations on indemnification
     set forth in this Section 11.4(a) will apply to (i) Sellers' or Nextera's
     breach of representations made in Section 5.1, 5.2, 5.6, 5.11, 5.12, 5.14,
     5.16, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 8.7 (ii) any Seller Indemnifiable Claims by
     Buyer pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(B), 11.2(a)(C) or 11.2(a)(D) or (iii) any
     Buyer Indemnifiable Claims by Seller pursuant to Section 11.3(a)(B) or
     11.3(a)(C).

          (b) All indemnity payments payable hereunder shall be paid in
     immediately available funds within five (5) Business Days after the later
     of (i) the receipt of a written request from the party entitled to such
     indemnification payment and (ii) the day of payment of the amount that is
     the subject of the indemnification payment by the Party entitled to receive
     the indemnification payment. All such indemnification payments shall be
     made to the accounts and in the manner specified in writing by the Party
     entitled to receive such indemnification payments.

     Section 11.5. Procedure for Indemnification with Respect to Third-Party
Claims.

          (a) If either Party (the "Indemnified Party") determines to seek
     indemnification under this Article with respect to Indemnifiable Claims
     resulting from the assertion of liability by third parties, it shall give
     notice to the other party (the "Indemnifying Party") within ten (10) days
     of the Indemnified Party's becoming aware of any such Indemnifiable Claim
     or of facts upon which any such Indemnifiable Claim will be based; the
     notice shall set forth such information with respect thereto as is then
     reasonably available to the Indemnified Party. If any such liability is
     asserted against the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party notifies
     the Indemnifying Party thereof, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, if
     it so elects by written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within
     twenty (20) days after receiving the Indemnified Party's notice, to assume
     the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Indemnified Party shall also have
     the right to employ its own counsel in any such case, but the fees and
     expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party;
     and (ii) the rights of the Indemnified Party to be indemnified hereunder in
     respect of Indemnifiable Claims resulting from the assertion of liability
     by third parties shall not be adversely affected by its failure to give
     notice pursuant to the foregoing unless, and, if so, only to the extent
     that, the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. With respect
     to any assertion of liability by a third party that results in an
     Indemnifiable Claim, the Parties hereto shall make available to each other
     all relevant information in their possession material to any such
     assertion.

          (b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party, within twenty (20) days
     after receipt of the aforesaid notice of an Indemnifiable Claim, fails to
     assume the defense of the Indemnified Party against such Indemnifiable
     Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense,
     compromise or settlement of such action on behalf of and for the account
     and risk of the Indemnifying Party with the consent of the Indemnifying
     Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, (i) if
     there is a reasonable probability that an Indemnifiable Claim may
     materially and adversely affect Buyer or FTI, other than as a result of
     money damages or other money payments, Buyer and FTI shall have the right
     to defend, compromise or settle such Indemnifiable Claim; and (ii) Sellers
     and Nextera shall not, without Buyer's written consent, settle or
     compromise any Indemnifiable Claim or consent to entry of any judgment in
     respect thereof unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes as
     an unconditional term thereof providing for the giving by the claimant or
     the plaintiff to Buyer and FTI a release from all liability in respect of
     such Indemnifiable Claim.

     Section 11.6. Insurance Proceeds; Recoveries under Section 3.5. To the
extent that any Indemnifiable Claim is covered by insurance held by the
Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article XI only with respect to the amount of Damages that are
in excess of the cash proceeds received by such Indemnified Party pursuant to
such insurance. If such Indemnified Party receives such cash insurance proceeds
prior to the time such Indemnifiable Claim is paid, then the amount payable by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to such Indemnifiable Claim shall be reduced by
the amount of such insurance

                                      -48-

<PAGE>

proceeds. If such Indemnified Party receives such cash insurance proceeds after
such Indemnifiable Claim is paid, then upon receipt by the Indemnified Party of
any cash proceeds pursuant to such insurance up to the amount of the Damages
incurred by such Indemnified Party with respect to such Indemnifiable Claim,
such Indemnified Party shall repay any portion of such amount which was
previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party in
satisfaction of such Indemnifiable Claim. In addition to the foregoing, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that, if FTI and Buyer have received a recovery or
compensation under Section 3.5 for uncollectible Receivables or any Estimated
Working Capital Discrepancy Amount, FTI and Buyer shall have no right to make
any additional claim under Article XI to the extent of the amount of such claim
that has been recovered or compensated under Section 3.5.

                                   ARTICLE XII

     be extended to February 29, 2004 if the transactions contemplated by this

     or from the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission in
     connection with the Parties' filings under the HSR Act (as such date may be

     before the date this Agreement is sought to be terminated pursuant to this
     clause (i);

               (ii) there shall be any law that makes consummation of the

     Recommendation and the Nextera Stockholder Approval shall not have been
     obtained;

          (c) by Nextera:

               (i) if a breach of or failure to perform in any material respect

     FTI set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which would cause any
     of the conditions set forth in Article X not to be satisfied, and such
     condition shall be incapable of being satisfied by the End Date; or

               (ii) as contemplated by Section 7.4(b)(iii); provided, however,

     Sellers set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which would cause
     any of the conditions set forth in Article IX not to be satisfied, and such
     condition is incapable of being satisfied by the End Date;
