 **Exhibit 10.1**

 ** _Guaranty_**

  

 ** **

  

This Guaranty, dated as of April 26, 2010 (this " _Guaranty_ "), by GTCR Fund
IX/A, L.P. (the " _Guarantor_ ") is in favor of Protection One, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). Reference is hereby made to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of April
26, 2010, among the Company, Protection Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" _Parent_ "), and Protection Acquisition Sub, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Acquisition Sub_ "). Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise
defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

# 1. _Guaranty_. To induce Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, the
Guarantor, intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees to the Company the payment by Parent and
Acquisition Sub of the Parent Termination Fee and other reimbursement
and indemnification obligations under the Merger Agreement and costs of
collection (including attorneys fees) associated with enforcing the
Companys rights hereunder (the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the maximum aggregate amount payable by the Guarantor under
this Guaranty shall in no event exceed the full amount of the Parent
Termination Fee plus $2,000,000.

  

# 

  

# 2. _Terms of Guaranty_.

  

# 

  

## (a) This Guaranty is one of payment, not collection, and a separate action
or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce
this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against Parent
or Acquisition Sub or any other person or whether Parent or Acquisition Sub
or any other person are joined in any such action or actions.

  

## 

  

## (b) If Parent fails to discharge its Guaranteed Obligations when due, then
all of the Guarantors liabilities to the Company hereunder in respect of
such Guaranteed Obligations shall, at the Companys option, become
immediately due and payable and the Company may at any time and from time to
time, at the Companys option, and so long as Parent has failed to perform
any of its Guaranteed Obligations, take any and all actions available
hereunder or under applicable Law to collect any of the Guarantors
liabilities hereunder in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations.

  

## 

  

## (c) All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United
States, in immediately available funds. The Guarantor promises and
undertakes to make all payments hereunder free and clear of any
deduction, offset, defense, claim or counterclaim of any kind.

  

## 

  

## (d) The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, be absolute, irrevocable and
unconditional irrespective of:

        
   

  

### 

  

### (i) the value, genuineness, validity, regularity, illegality or
enforceability of the Merger Agreement, the Financing Commitments, or any
other agreement or instrument referred to herein, other than by reason of
fraud by the Company;

  

### 

  

### (ii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of
Parent, Acquisition Sub, or any other person now or hereafter liable with
respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise interested in the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

  

### 

  

### (iii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting Parent or Acquisition Sub, or any other person now or
hereafter liable with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise
interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or any
of their assets;

  

### 

  

### (iv) the existence of any claim, set-off or other right that the
Guarantor may have at any time against Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Company, whether in connection with any Guaranteed Obligation or otherwise;
or

  

### 

  

### (v) any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any
extent vary the risk of the Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of
the Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.

  

### 

  

## (e) The Guarantor hereby waives any and all notice of the creation,
renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice
of or proof of reliance by the Company upon this Guaranty or acceptance of
this Guaranty. The Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall
conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred
in reliance upon this Guaranty, and all dealings between Parent, Acquisition
Sub or the Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other,
shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or consummated in
reliance upon this Guaranty. When pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder
against the Guarantor, the Company shall be under no obligation to pursue
such rights and remedies it may have against Parent or Acquisition Sub or any
other person for the Guaranteed Obligations or any right of offset with
respect thereto, and any failure by the Company to pursue such other rights
or remedies or to collect any payments from Parent or Acquisition Sub or any
such other person or to realize upon or to exercise any such right of offset,
and any release by the Company of Parent or Acquisition Sub or any such other
person or any right of offset, shall not relieve the Guarantor of any
liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies,
whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the Company.

  

## 

  

## (f) The Company shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to any
Guaranteed Obligation in the event that Parent or Acquisition Sub

  



        
   

  

## 

  

## becomes subject to a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, and
the failure of the Company to so file shall not affect the Guarantors
obligations hereunder. In the event that any payment to the Company in
respect of any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned for any reason whatsoever, the Guarantor shall remain liable
hereunder with respect to the Guaranteed Obligation as if such payment had
not been made.

  

## 

  

## (g) The Guarantor reserves the right to assert defenses which Parent or
Acquisition Sub may have to payment of any Guaranteed Obligation.

  

## 

  

# 3. _Waiver of Acceptance, Presentment; Etc_. The Guarantor, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, diligence,
grace, protest, presentment, demand, notice of non-payment or any notice not
provided for herein. Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial
direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Guaranty are knowingly made
in contemplation of such benefits.

  

# 

  

# 4. _No Recourse; Sole Remedy_. Notwithstanding the fact that the
Guarantor may be a partnership, by its acceptance of the benefits of this
Guaranty, the Company acknowledges and agrees that neither it nor any of its
former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling
persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, members, managers,
agents, affiliates, or any former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holder, controlling person, stockholder, director, officer, employee,
member, manager, general or limited partner, affiliate, agent or assignee of
any of the foregoing, has any right of recovery under this Guaranty against,
and no liability under this Guaranty shall attach to, the former, current or
future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, members, managers, agents, affiliates,
general or limited partners or assignees of the Guarantor, of Parent, of
Acquisition Sub or of any former, current or future direct or indirect equity
holder, controlling person, stockholder, director, officer, employee, member,
manager, general or limited partner, affiliate, agent or assignee of any of
the foregoing (collectively, but not including the Guarantor, Parent or
Acquisition Sub, each an " _Affiliate_ "), whether based on contract, tort or
strict liability, and whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of
Parent or Acquisition Sub against an Affiliate, the Guarantor, Parent or
Acquisition Sub (including a claim to enforce the Equity Commitment Letter),
by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding,
by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise). Other
than pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, solely with respect to the
parties thereto, recourse against the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and all of its affiliates
against the Guarantor and any of its Affiliates (other than against Parent or
Acquisition Sub) in respect of any liabilities or obligations arising under,
or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute,
and shall cause its respective affiliates not to institute, any proceeding or
bring any other claim arising under, or in connection with, the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, against the Guarantor or
any of its Affiliates (other than against Parent or

  



        
   

  

# 

  

# Acquisition Sub) except for claims against the Guarantor under this
Guaranty for up to the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations and except for
claims in respect of the Confidentiality Agreement solely with respect to the
parties thereto.  Nothing set forth in this Guaranty shall affect or be
construed to affect any liability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to the Company
or shall confer or give or shall be construed to confer or give to any person
other than the Company any rights or remedies against  the Guarantor. The
Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall
cause its respective Affiliates not to institute, any proceeding asserting
that this Guaranty is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with
its terms. The Company acknowledges that the Guarantor is agreeing to enter
into this Guaranty in reliance on the provisions set forth in this _Section
4_, and the Guarantor acknowledges that the Company is agreeing to enter into
the Merger Agreement in reliance on this Guaranty.  For all purposes of this
Guaranty, pursuit of a claim against a person by the Company or any of its
controlled affiliates shall be deemed a pursuit of a claim by the Company. A
person shall be deemed to have pursued a claim against another person if such
first person brings legal action against such other person, adds such other
person to an existing legal proceeding, or otherwise asserts a legal claim of
any nature against such other person. This _Section 4_ shall survive
termination of this Guaranty.

  

# 

  

# 5. _Subrogation_. Unless and until all amounts payable by the Guarantor
under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in immediately available
funds, (i) the Guarantor hereby unconditionally waives any rights that it may
now have or hereafter acquire against Parent or Acquisition Sub that arise
from the existence, payment, performance, or enforcement of the Guarantors
obligations under or in respect of this Guaranty or any other agreement in
connection therewith, including, without limitation, any right
of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification
and any right to participate in any claim or remedy against Parent or
Acquisition Sub (including any right that would result in the Guarantor being
deemed a creditor of Parent or Acquisition Sub pursuant to this Guaranty
under the United States Bankruptcy Code), whether or not such claim, remedy
or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common Law,
including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from Parent or
Acquisition Sub, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-
off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim,
remedy or right, and (ii) the Guarantor shall not exercise any such rights.
If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the immediately
preceding sentence at any time prior to the payment in full in immediately
available funds of all amounts payable under this Guaranty, such amount shall
be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Company, shall be
segregated from other property and funds of the Guarantor and shall forthwith
be promptly paid or delivered to the Company in the same form as so received
(with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to
all amounts payable by the Guarantor under this Guaranty.

  

# 

  

# 6. _Continuing Guaranty_. This Guaranty may not be revoked or terminated
and shall remain in full force and effect until the indefeasible payment and
satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, shall be binding upon the
Guarantor, its successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the Company and its respective successors, transferees and
assigns. Notwithstanding the

  



        
   

  

# 

  

# foregoing, this Guaranty shall terminate and the Guarantor shall have no
further rights or obligations under this Guaranty as of the earlier of (i)
the Effective Time and (ii) the end of three (3) months following of the date
on which the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
except in connection with a claim for payment of any Guaranteed Obligation
presented by the Company to Parent or the Guarantor during such three-month
period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company or any
of its controlled affiliates asserts in any litigation or other proceeding
that the provisions of _Section 1_ hereof limiting the Guarantors
liability to the Parent Termination Fee or the provisions of _Section 4_
hereof or this _Section 6_ are illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole
or in part, or asserting any theory of liability against any Affiliate or,
other than its right to recover from the Guarantor for up to the amount of
the Guaranteed Obligations (subject to limitations described herein), the
Guarantor or Parent, then (i) the obligations of the Guarantor under this
Guaranty shall terminate _ab initio_  and be null and void, and (ii) neither
the Guarantor nor any Affiliate shall have any liability to the Company with
respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or under
this Guaranty; provided, that the foregoing shall not affect the right of the
Company to assert any claim under the Confidentiality Agreement against the
other parties thereto.

  

# 

  

# 7. _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Guaranty, together
with the Merger Agreement and the Support Agreements, constitutes the entire
agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and
all prior discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings
and agreements, whether written or oral, among Parent, Acquisition Sub and
the Guarantor or any of their Affiliates on the one hand, and the Company or
any of its affiliates on the other hand. This Guaranty is not intended to and
shall not confer upon any person other than the parties hereto and the
Affiliates of Guarantor, as provided in _Section 4_, any rights or
remedies hereunder.

  

# 

  

# 8. _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any provision
of this Guaranty will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Guarantor and the Company, or in
the case of waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.
No waiver by any party of any breach or violation of, or default under, this
Guaranty, whether intentional or not, will be deemed to extend to any prior
or subsequent breach, violation or default hereunder or affect in any way any
rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No delay
or omission on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or
remedy under this Guaranty will operate as a waiver thereof. The Company
shall not have any obligation to proceed at any time or in any manner
against, or exhaust any or all of the Companys rights against, Parent or any
other person now or hereafter liable for any Guaranteed Obligations or
interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement prior to
proceeding against the Guarantor hereunder.

  

# 

  

# 9. _Counterparts_. This Guaranty may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of
which together will constitute one and the same instrument. This Guaranty
will become effective when duly executed by each party hereto.

  



         
 

  

# 

  

# 10. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands, claims and other
communications required or permitted to be delivered, given or
otherwise provided under this Guaranty must be in writing and must be
delivered, given or otherwise provided:
