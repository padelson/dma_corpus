2.4 _Approvals and Consents; Novation_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
subject to the last proviso of this sentence and the provisions of Sections
2.5 and 2.6, to the extent that the sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or

_Consents_ "), or (iv) would require any notices to any Governmental Authority
or any third party, and such Consents shall not have been obtained or notices
given prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a sale,
conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery, or an attempted sale,
conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery thereof if any of the foregoing

third party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Closing shall occur
notwithstanding the foregoing without any adjustment to the Purchase Price on
account of such required authorization; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ ,
that this Section 2.4 (other than the immediately following sentences, to

shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate with each
other, to obtain promptly (A) such Consents and deliver such notices
(including identifying such Consents or notices and consulting with each other
regarding such Consents or notices) and (B) the enterprise software license
agreement with Microsoft Corporation referred to in the definition of Consent
Payment Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall be responsible for,
and shall control any negotiations with third parties regarding any
such Consents; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that (I) neither party
shall agree to the payment of any Consent Payment Amounts without the consent
of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned, and (II) Seller shall not agree to any modification to the
terms of any Contract for purposes of obtaining a Consent or agree to any
material term in such enterprise software license agreement in any such case
without the prior consent to Purchaser, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. Pending or in the absence of such Consents
or notices, Seller shall, and shall cause any Other Seller to, hold such
Purchased Assets for the use and benefit, insofar as reasonably possible, of
Purchaser or any of its Designees. The parties shall cooperate with each other
to enter into mutually agreeable and lawful arrangements designed to provide
to Purchaser or its Designee with the costs and benefits of the use of such
Purchased Asset and to Seller or any Other Seller the benefits, including any
indemnities, that they would have obtained had the Purchased Asset been
conveyed to Purchaser or its Designee at the Closing. Once such Consent is
obtained or notice is delivered, Seller shall or shall cause the Other
Sellers to sell, assign, transfer, convey and license such Purchased Asset to
Purchaser or its Designee for no additional consideration. Purchaser and
Seller shall equally share any applicable Transfer Taxes in connection with
such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or license in accordance with
Section 6.12(a)(i). To the extent that any Purchased Asset cannot be provided
to Purchaser or its Designee following the Closing pursuant to this Section
2.4, Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter
into such arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting)
to provide to the parties the economic (taking into account Tax costs and
benefits) and, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, operational
equivalent of obtaining such Consent or delivering such notice and the
performance by Purchaser or its Designee of its obligations thereunder.
Subject to the terms above, to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
Seller and the Other Sellers shall hold in trust for and pay to Purchaser or
its Designee promptly upon receipt thereof, such Purchased Assets and all
income, proceeds and other monies (net of all reasonable incremental costs
associated with the retention and maintenance of the Purchased Assets ("
_Maintenance Costs_ ")) received by Seller or any Other Seller to the extent
related to its use of any such Purchased Asset in connection with the
arrangements under this Section 2.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
shall have no obligation whatsoever to retain any portion of the Business,
other than any individual asset or Contract (but only until such time as the
transfer thereof may be effected in accordance with this Agreement), in



 

-7- order to obtain any such Consents or waivers referred to in this Section 2.4
or elsewhere in this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall require any
waiver of any conditions to the conditions to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby set forth in Article VII.

(b) Seller and Purchaser shall equally share the cost of all Consent Payment
Amounts for all amounts up to and not in excess of the Consent Payment
Threshold Amount, and Seller shall be responsible for, and shall reimburse
Purchaser for all Consent Payment Amounts incurred or paid by Purchaser in
excess of the Pro Rata Threshold Amount. Without derogating the intent of the
foregoing sentence, until the forty-fifth (45th) calendar day following the
Closing Date, Seller shall make any payments that are Consent Payment Amounts
and be reimbursed by Purchaser following such forty-fifth (45th) calendar day
as set forth in this Section 2.4(b). On the forty-fifth (45th) calendar day
following the Closing Date, and at such additional dates thereafter as
reasonably requested by a party, Seller and Purchaser shall: (i) prepare and
deliver to the other party a statement showing the total Consent Payment
Amounts paid or incurred by such party as of the date thereof (each a "
_Consent Payment Statement_ "); and (ii) make available to the other party and
its representatives all relevant receipts and records relating to such Consent
Payment Statement. The parties shall then add the amounts set forth on the
Consent Payment Statement prepared by Seller and the Consent Payment Statement
prepared by Purchaser (the " _Aggregate Consent Payment Amount_ "). To the
extent that the Aggregate Consent Payment Amount is less than or equal to the
Consent Payment Threshold Amount, the parties shall divide (x) the Aggregate
Consent Payment Amount by (y) two (the " _Pro Rata Consent Payment Amount_ "),
and the party that has shown a lower Consent Payment Amount on its Consent
Payment Statement shall promptly pay to the other party the difference between
(1) the Pro Rata Consent Payment Amount and (2) the Consent Payment Amount set
forth on such partyÂ’s Consent Payment Statement (to the extent such amounts
have not been previously paid or reimbursed). To the extent that the Aggregate
Consent Payment Amount is in excess of the Consent Payment Threshold Amount,
then Seller shall reimburse to Purchaser all Consent Payment Amounts incurred
or paid by Purchaser in excess of the Pro Rata Threshold Amount.

2.5 _Novation and Assignment_. 

Without limiting the generality of Section 2.4 or any other provision hereof,
each party hereto, at the request of the other party, shall, and shall cause
any Subsidiary thereof to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or
to cause to be obtained, any Consent, substitution, or amendment required to
novate any Contract requiring a novation pursuant to such Contract or local
Law that constitutes part of the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities
or to obtain in writing the unconditional release of such third party to such
arrangements, so that, Purchaser and/or its Designees will be solely
responsible for performance of Assumed Liabilities under such Contracts. If
and when any such Consent or waiver shall be obtained or such agreement,
lease, license or other rights or obligations shall otherwise become
assignable or able to be novated, Seller or such Subsidiary shall thereafter
assign, or cause to be assigned, all its rights, obligations and other
liabilities thereunder to Purchaser or its Designee without receipt of further
consideration (other than Maintenance Costs), and Purchaser or its Designee
shall, without the payment of any further consideration (other than
Maintenance Costs), assume such rights and obligations.



 

-8- 2.6 _Consents for Real Property Assignments and Subleases_. Without limiting
the generality of Section 2.4 or any other provision hereof:

(a) Promptly following execution of this Agreement, Seller or such Other
Seller, as applicable, shall contact the Landlords of the Assigned Real
Property and the Subleased Real Property and seek each LandlordÂ’s Consent
(which, for purposes of this Section 2.6, shall be deemed to include providing
a substitute for that certain underlease between Aleri Limited and InfoSpace
Investments Ltd., dated February 17, 2006, with the Landlord thereunder) to
the applicable Lease assignments or subleases. Seller or such Other Seller, as
applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
Consents, but shall not be required to commence judicial proceedings for a
declaration that a required Landlord Consent has been unreasonably withheld or
delayed. In connection with the foregoing, Seller or such Other Seller, as
applicable, shall have the right to pay any additional consideration payable
prior to the Closing or provide any additional security or guarantees to the
Landlords at its sole cost and expense and at SellerÂ’s or Other SellerÂ’s sole
option; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Seller nor such Other Seller
shall agree to any amendment or modification to the terms of the Lease with
respect to the Assigned Real Property and the Subleased Real Property that
will have a material and adverse effect on the terms of such Lease on or after
the Closing without PurchaserÂ’s prior written consent.

(b) Purchaser and its Designees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Seller or such Other Seller, as applicable, in attempting to
obtain the Consents contemplated by Section 2.6(a), including (i)
providing financial statements, references and substitute security and/or
guarantees as may be reasonably requested by the relevant Landlords, (ii)
entering into any amendments to the Leases of the Assigned Real Property as
may be reasonably requested by the relevant Landlords or (iii) entering into
direct Leases of the Assigned Real Property and, if possible, the property
that is the subject of the Real Property Subleases with the relevant
Landlords, if requested by such Landlords. Any additional consideration paid
by Seller in order to obtain a Consent from any such Landlord shall be deemed
to be a Consent Payment Amount. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Designees
shall communicate directly with any of SellerÂ’s or any Other SellerÂ’s
Landlords without the prior consent of Seller or such Other Seller, as
applicable.

(c) If, despite the efforts of the parties as set forth above, a Landlord of
an Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property fails to consent to the
applicable Lease assignment or sublease prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser
or one of its Designees shall be entitled to occupy the relevant Assigned
Real Property or Subleased Real Property as a licensee upon the terms and
conditions contained in the SellerÂ’s, or Other SellerÂ’s, Lease of such
Assigned Real Property or the terms of the relevant sublease, as applicable.
Such license shall not be revocable due to the relevant LandlordÂ’s failure to
consent, unless (A) the relevant Landlord formally, unconditionally refuses to
consent or (B) an enforcement action or forfeiture by the relevant Landlord
due to PurchaserÂ’s or one of its DesigneeÂ’s occupation of such Real Property
cannot, in the reasonable opinion of Seller, be avoided other than by
requiring Purchaser or one of its Designees to immediately vacate
the relevant Real Property. In either such event, Seller or such Other
Seller, as applicable, may terminate the license by delivering written notice
to Purchaser, and Purchaser or its Designee shall vacate the relevant Real
Property as promptly as commercially practicable after a  



 

-9-  notice served by Seller. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Designees shall be
entitled to make any claim or demand against, or obtain reimbursement
from, Seller or any Other Seller with respect to any costs, losses, claims,
liabilities or damages incurred by Purchaser or any of its Designees as a
consequence of being obliged to vacate a Real Property or in obtaining
alternative premises, including, without limitation, any enforcement action
which a Landlord may take against Purchaser or any of its Designees.

ARTICLE III 

PURCHASE PRICE AND ADJUSTMENTS

3.1 _Purchase Price_.

The purchase price in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
an amount in cash equal to One Hundred and Thirty-Five Million dollars and no
cents ($135,000,000)(the " _Purchase Price_ "), which comprises the total
purchase price to be paid for the Purchased Assets, Transferred Business
Intellectual Property Rights and Assumed Liabilities in each respective
jurisdiction as provided in the Allocation Schedule. The amounts payable in
respect of transactions contemplated hereby shall be further adjusted as
contemplated by Section 3.3.

3.2 _Payment of Purchase Price_.

On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay for itself (where it is acting as
Purchaser) and on behalf of its Designees to Seller for its own account and
otherwise as agent for each of the relevant Other Sellers the Purchase Price.
Without modifying Section 9.2(i), such amount shall be payable in United
States dollars in immediately available federal funds to such bank account or
accounts as shall be designated in writing by Seller no later than the second
Business Day prior to the Closing.

3.3 _Working Capital Amount; Reimbursement_.

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the " _Estimate Statement_ ")
setting forth the Estimated Working Capital Amount. The Estimate Statement
shall contain a level of detail sufficient to identify the components used to
calculate the Estimated Working Capital Amount and shall be prepared in good
faith by Seller in accordance with the accounting principles, procedures and
assumptions set forth in Section 4.13 of the Disclosure Letter. To the extent
that the Estimated Working Capital Amount is less than zero, Seller shall pay
to Purchaser at Closing the amount by which the Estimated Working
Capital Amount is less than zero (the " _Working Capital Deficiency
Adjustment_ ").

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Closing, but in no event later
than ninety (90) calendar days following the Closing Date, Seller shall: (i)
prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (x) showing the Working Capital
Amount as calculated by Seller and (y) the total Consent Payment Amounts
incurred by any party as of the date thereof (the " _Closing Statement of
Working Capital_ "); and (ii) make available to Purchaser and its
representatives all relevant books and records relating to the Closing
Statement of Working Capital. Purchaser shall provide Seller and its  



 

-10-  representatives with reasonable access, during normal business hours, to the
facilities, personnel and accounting records of the Business acquired
by Purchaser or its Designee, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit
Seller to prepare the Closing Statement of Working Capital.

(c) During the 45-day period following PurchaserÂ’s receipt of the Closing
Statement of Working Capital (the " _Review Period_ "), Purchaser and its
representatives, including its independent auditors, shall be afforded the
opportunity to review the Closing Statement of Working Capital and the
calculations related thereto. Seller or any Subsidiary thereof shall provide
reasonable assistance, including reasonable access to information concerning
the Business that is retained by Seller and its Subsidiaries following the
Closing, to Purchaser its Designees or any representatives, including its
independent auditors, in connection with such review.

(d) If Purchaser disputes the Closing Statement of Working Capital or any
calculation related thereto (other than the accounting principles, procedures,
assumptions and estimates set forth in Section 4.13 of the Disclosure Letter,
which Purchaser shall not be permitted to dispute), Purchaser shall deliver to
Seller, prior to the expiration of the Review Period, a proposed adjustment
notice (" _Proposed Adjustment Notice_ "), which shall contain, in reasonable
detail, the items of dispute and the adjustment it recommends making to the
Closing Statement of Working Capital to address such disputes, to the extent
reasonably available. If the Proposed Adjustment Notice is not delivered to
Seller prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Statement of
Working Capital shall become final, binding and conclusive on all parties.

(e) If a Proposed Adjustment Notice is delivered within the Review Period,
Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute for
a 30-day period commencing on the date such notice is received by Seller. If
Purchaser and Seller subsequently resolve such dispute during such 30-day
period, Purchaser and Seller shall document such resolution in writing and the
Closing Statement of Working Capital, as modified, if applicable, by such
writing, shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties. If Purchaser
and Seller cannot resolve such dispute within such 30 day period, Purchaser
and Seller shall retain Ernst and Young LLP to act as the arbitrator (the "
_Arbitrator_ ") of such dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that if either party
shall reasonably discover a conflict of interest associated with the
Arbitrator, the parties shall retain a mutually agreeable
alternative nationally-recognized accounting firm without such a conflict of
interest to act as the Arbitrator. Any arbitration shall be conducted in New
Castle County, Delaware, and such proceedings shall be in English. The parties
hereto shall instruct the Arbitrator to act promptly to resolve any dispute
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In resolving any disputed
items, the Arbitrator may not assign a value to any disputed item greater than
the greatest value for such disputed item claimed by any party or less than
the lowest value for such disputed item claimed by any party. The parties
shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Arbitrator issue its written
decision within 30 days after the appointment of such Arbitrator, which
decision shall be final, binding and conclusive on both Purchaser and Seller.
The resolution of the Arbitrator with respect to any such dispute shall be
final, binding and conclusive on all parties. The final, binding
and conclusive Closing Statement of Working Capital (x) as deemed accepted by
Purchaser, (y) as modified by any writing among Purchaser and Seller, if
applicable, and/or (z) as modified, if applicable, by the written decision of
the Arbitrator shall be the " _Final Closing Statement of Working Capital_ ".
Purchaser and  



 

-11-  Seller shall cooperate with the Arbitrator in connection with this Section
3.3(e). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser
and Seller shall each provide promptly, or cause to be provided promptly, to
the Arbitrator all information, and to make available at the arbitration
proceeding all personnel, as are reasonably necessary to permit the Arbitrator
to resolve any disputes pursuant to this Section 3.3(e). The expenses of the
Arbitrator in resolving any disputes under this Section 3.3(e) shall be borne
equally by Purchaser and Seller.

(f) Within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the Final Closing
Statement of Working Capital:

(i) if the Working Capital Amount specified in the Final Closing Statement of
Working Capital is less than zero, Seller shall pay to Purchaser the
amount to which the Working Capital Amount specified in the Final Closing
Statement of Working Capital is less than zero; and

(ii) if (A) there has been a Working Capital Deficiency Adjustment; and (B)
the Working Capital Amount set forth on the Final Closing Statement of Working
Capital is greater than the Estimated Working Capital Amount, then the amount
of the Working Capital Deficiency Adjustment shall be added to the Working
Capital Amount specified in the Final Closing Statement of Working Capital,
and, if the sum of (x) the Working Capital Deficiency Adjustment amount plus
(y) the Working Capital Amount specified in the Final Closing Statement of
Working Capital, is greater than zero (such amount in excess of zero the "
_Deficiency Reimbursement Amount_ "), Purchaser shall pay to Seller the
Deficiency Reimbursement Amount;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Deficiency Reimbursement Amount exceed the lesser of (1) the amount
by which the Working Capital Amount specified in the Final Closing Statement
of Working Capital is greater than zero, and (2) amount of the Working
Capital Deficiency Adjustment.

3.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_.

Purchaser and Seller shall agree on an allocation of the Purchase Price (and
all other capitalized costs) among the Purchased Assets and the
Transferred Business Intellectual Property Rights in accordance with (i) the
pro forma allocation schedule attached hereto as Schedule 3.4 and (ii) Code
Section 1060 and the U.S. Treasury Income Tax Regulations promulgated
thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as
appropriate) (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") within ninety (90) days of the
Closing Date. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree on the final
Allocation Schedule within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the
parties shall submit such dispute to the Arbitrator, following the
administrative procedures set forth Section 3.3(d), and the Arbitrator shall
resolve the allocation of the consideration to any items with respect to
which there is a dispute between the parties. In the absence of manifest
error, the determination of the Allocation Schedule by the Arbitrator shall be
final and binding on all parties and shall not be subject to contest. Seller
and Purchaser and their Affiliates shall report, act and file Tax Returns
(including, but not limited to, IRS Form 8594) in all respects and for all
purposes consistent with the Allocation Schedule. Neither Seller nor Purchaser
shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule unless required to do so by
applicable  



 

-12-  Law. Each of the parties agrees that they shall promptly advise each other
regarding the existence of any Tax audit, controversy or litigation related to
the Allocation Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
herein shall prevent Purchaser or Seller from settling any proposed deficiency
or adjustment assessed against it by any Governmental Authority based upon or
arising out of the Allocation Schedule, and neither Purchaser nor Seller
shall be required to litigate before any court any such proposed deficiency or
adjustment by any Governmental Authority challenging the Allocation Schedule.

similar power and authority to carry on the Business as the same is now being
conducted. Seller is not in default under or in violation of any provision of
its corporate charter or by-laws.

Delaware General Corporation Law with respect to certain matters authorized
by stockholders of Purchaser by written consent in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, no other corporate proceedings on the part
of Purchaser are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and (ii) will be duly authorized by each applicable Designee by all
requisite corporate, partnership or other action prior to the Closing.
Purchaser and each Designee has full power and authority to execute and
deliver, as the case may be, this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party and to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser, and the
other Transaction Documents will be duly executed and delivered by Purchaser
and any Designee party thereto, and this Agreement constitutes, and the other
Transaction Documents when so executed and delivered will constitute, a valid
and legally binding obligation of Purchaser and each of its Designees party
thereto, enforceable against it or them, as the case may be, in accordance
with its terms except as enforceability may be affected by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,  



 

-28-  reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditorsÂ’ rights generally, general equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law) and the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing.

(b) Except for the required filings under the applicable Antitrust
Regulations, the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents by Purchaser and the Designees and the consummation by
Purchaser and the Designees of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby do not and will not (A) violate or conflict with any provision of
the respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws or similar
organizational documents of Purchaser or any of its Designees, (B) result in
any violation or breach or constitute any default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a material
benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien under any material
contract, indenture, mortgage, lease, note or other agreement or instrument to
which Purchaser or any of its Designees is subject or is a party, or (C)
violate, conflict with or result in any breach under any provision of any Law
applicable to Purchaser or any of its Designees or any of their respective
properties or assets, except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), to the
extent that any such breach, default, termination,
cancellation, acceleration, Lien, violation, conflict, breach or loss would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

5.3 _Governmental Approvals and Consents_.

Neither Purchaser nor any of its Designees is subject to any order, judgment,
decree, stipulation, injunction or agreement with any Governmental Authority
which would prevent or materially interfere with or delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents or would be
reasonably likely to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect. No claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation is pending or, to the knowledge of
Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser or any of its Designees which would
prevent or materially interfere with or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Except for any
requirements under any Antitrust Regulations, no Consent, approval, order or
authorization of, license or permit from, notice to or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Authority, is required on the
part of Purchaser or any of its Designees in connection with the execution,
delivery or performance of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby except for such Consents, approvals, orders or authorizations of,
licenses or permits, filings or notices which have been obtained or will be
obtained as of the Closing Date and remain in full force and effect and those
with respect to which the failure to have been so obtained or to remain in
full force and effect would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to result in a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

5.4 _Financial Capacity_.

Purchaser and certain investors have duly executed and delivered that certain
Series I Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, dated October 12, 2007 (the "
_Stock Purchase Agreement_ "), by  



 

-29-  and among Purchaser, certain of its Affiliates, and the investors that are
parties thereto (the " _Investors_ "), and concurrently with the entering
into of the Stock Purchase Agreement, (i) the Investors (other than Koala
Holdings Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (" _Koala_ "))
have deposited cash into an escrow account pursuant to one or more definitive
escrow agreements between such Investors and Boult, Cummings, Conners and
Cummings, PLC, as escrow agent, which escrow agreements are attached hereto as
_Annex 1_ (the " _Investor Escrow Agreements_ "), (ii) Koala has deposited
cash into an escrow account pursuant to a definitive escrow agreement by and
between Koala, Purchaser and U.S. Bank National Association, a national
banking association, as escrow agent, which escrow agreement is attached
hereto as _Annex 2_ (the " _Koala Escrow Agreement_ "), and (iii) Purchaser
has deposited cash into an escrow account pursuant to a definitive escrow
agreement by and between Purchaser and Boult, Cummings, Conners and Cummings,
PLC, as escrow agent, which escrow agreement is attached hereto as _Annex 3_
(the " _Purchaser Escrow Agreement_ ") (such deposited cash by the Investors
and Purchaser, the " _Purchase Escrow Funds_ ," and the Investor Escrow
Agreements, the Koala Escrow Agreement and the Purchaser Escrow Agreement,
collectively, the " _Purchase Funds Escrow Agreements_ "). Each of the
Purchase Funds Escrow Agreements have been duly executed and delivered by all
of the parties to such agreements. Purchaser has delivered to Seller on or
prior to the date hereof a true and correct, fully executed copy of the Stock
Purchase Agreement and the Purchase Funds Escrow Agreements, and such
agreements have not been amended or modified (except, from and after the date
hereof, to add additional parties who are investing additional equity funds in
Purchaser) and are in full force and effect. The Purchase Escrow Funds are in
the aggregate at least equal to the Purchase Price. The proceeds from the
transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement and the cash of
Purchaser held as part of the Purchase Escrow Funds are sufficient to enable
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.5 _Finders; Brokers_.

Neither Purchaser nor any Designee has employed any finder or broker in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents
who would have a valid claim for a fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents for which Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries would have any liability.

5.6 _Purchase for Investment_.

With respect to the Netherlands Subsidiary Shares, Purchaser and its
Designees are aware that such Netherlands Subsidiary Shares were not
registered under the Securities Act, or any other applicable securities Laws,
and were issued pursuant to exemptions therefrom. Purchaser or the Designee
thereof is purchasing the Netherlands Subsidiary Shares solely for investment,
with no present intention to distribute the Netherlands Subsidiary Shares to
any Person.



 

-30- 5.7 _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

Except for the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement,
none of Purchaser, the Subsidiaries or Affiliates of Purchaser nor any
other Person makes any other express or implied representation or warranty on
behalf of Purchaser.

of the Business or any material portion of the Purchased Assets or
Transferred Business Intellectual Property Rights or any asset or Intellectual

-33- 6.2 _Investigation of Business; Confidentiality_.

(a) Until the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
permit Purchaser, its Designees and their respective authorized agents
or representatives to have reasonable access to the Business Facilities,
properties, books, records and the Transferred Employees at reasonable hours
to review information and documentation and ask questions relative to the
properties, books, contracts, commitments and other records of the Business
and to conduct any other reasonable investigations; _provided_ , that such
investigation shall only be upon reasonable notice and shall not unreasonably
disrupt the personnel and operations of Seller and its Subsidiaries, shall
comply with the reasonable security and insurance requirements of Seller and
any Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its Subsidiaries
shall have no obligation to disclose any information the disclosure of which
is subject to a confidentiality obligation in favor of any third party. All
requests for access to the offices, properties, books and records of Seller
and its Subsidiaries shall be made to such representatives of Seller or any
Subsidiary as Seller shall designate, who shall be solely responsible for
coordinating all such requests and all access permitted hereunder. It is
further agreed that, until the Closing, neither Purchaser, its Designees nor
any of their respective Affiliates, agents or representatives shall contact
any of the employees en masse, customers (including dealers and distributors),
suppliers, joint venture partners or other Subsidiaries or Affiliates of
Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in
person or by telephone, electronic or other mail or other means of
communication, without the specific prior authorization of such
representatives of Seller or any Subsidiary, such authorization not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(b) The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and
its terms and all information, whether written or oral, furnished by either
party to the other party or any Affiliate of such other party in connection
with the negotiation of this Agreement (" _Confidential Information_ ") shall
be treated as "Evaluation Materials" under that certain letter agreement
between the parties dated as of June 19, 2007 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), and that the confidentiality provisions contained therein with
respect to the Confidential Information shall apply equally ( _mutatis
mutandis_ ) to both of the parties hereto.

(c) For avoidance of doubt, all Confidential Information delivered by or on
behalf of Seller prior to the Closing pursuant to the Confidentiality
Agreement or this Section 6.2, in each case to the extent such Confidential
Information relates to the Purchased Assets or the Business shall, become the
Confidential Information of Purchaser as of the Closing.

(d) Effective as of the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable
Subsidiary to, release the Transferred Employees from any confidentiality
obligations they may have to Seller (or a Subsidiary thereof) with respect to
trade secrets, confidential information and other information to the extent
related to the Business, but only to the extent such information does not also
relate to any business or assets of Seller (or a Subsidiary thereof) not
transferred to Purchaser (or a Designee) under this Agreement, or any other
Transaction Documents.



 

-34- 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts; No Inconsistent Action_.

(a) Subject to Section 6.3(b) and the terms and conditions hereof, Seller and
the Other Sellers and Purchaser and its Designees agree to use reasonable
best efforts to take all actions necessary, proper or advisable in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and to cause
the conditions to each partyÂ’s obligation to close the transactions
contemplated hereby as set forth in Article VII to be satisfied, including all
actions necessary to obtain (i) all Governmental Consents required for the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b), and (ii) all
other Consents (it being understood that no party hereto shall be required to
expend any material sum of money or agree to any material restrictions on the
operation of its business in order to obtain any Consents except as otherwise
specified in Section 2.4) necessary or appropriate in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.
Each of Seller and the Other Sellers and Purchaser and its Designees agree
that (i) no contact will be initiated with, or consent sought from, any
Governmental Authority (other than in respect to compliance with applicable
Antitrust Regulations) prior to the Closing Date without the consent of the
other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (ii)
each party will be given prior notice of and a reasonable opportunity to
consult with the other party regarding contacts with Governmental
Authorities regarding antitrust or merger control matters. The parties hereto
shall cooperate fully with each other to the extent necessary in connection
with the foregoing.

(b) Purchaser and Seller shall timely and promptly make all filings which may
be required for the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b)
by each of them in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
each of Seller and Purchaser shall file Notification and Report Forms under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "
_HSR Act_ ") or any other similar filings under Antitrust Regulations in the
United States, any state thereof, any foreign country or the European Union as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement. In
addition, Purchaser and Seller agree, and shall cause each of the Other
Sellers and Designees, as applicable, to cooperate and to use reasonable best
efforts to take all actions necessary to: obtain any government Consents
required for the Closing (including through compliance with the HSR Act and
any applicable foreign governmental reports, applications or notifications
required by the Antitrust Regulations), to respond to any requests for
information from any Governmental Authority, and to avoid and/or overcome any
action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any judgment, injunction or other
order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents
or prohibits, or could restrict, prevent or prohibit, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall Seller or any Other Seller be required or expected to
retain any of the Purchased Assets (including assets that would be Purchased
Assets but for any inability to receive a Consent) in order to comply with its
obligations in respect of the foregoing. Each party shall furnish to the other
such necessary information and assistance as the other party may reasonably
request in connection with the preparation of any necessary filings or
submissions by it to any Governmental Authority. Except as prohibited or
restricted by Law or any Antitrust Regulations, each party or its attorneys
shall provide the other party or its attorneys the opportunity to make copies
of all correspondence,  



 

-35-  filings or communications (or memoranda setting forth the substance thereof)
between such party or its representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement,
the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent it becomes necessary for each
party to receive a copy of the other partyÂ’s HSR Act filing, each partyÂ’s HSR
Act filing would only be provided to counsel for the other party (but not to
such other party itself, unless expressly agreed to in writing by the
parties), pursuant to a mutually-agreeable confidentiality and joint defense
agreement. Without in any way limiting the foregoing, the parties hereto will
consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views
of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating
to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Regulation. 

(c) Each of Purchaser and Seller shall notify and keep the other advised as to
(i) any material communication from the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (ii) any Proceeding pending and known to such party, or to its knowledge
threatened, which challenges, or would challenge, the transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to the provisions of Article X hereof, Seller and
Purchaser shall not, and shall each cause its respective Subsidiaries not to,
take any action inconsistent with their obligations under this Agreement.

(d) If any "moratorium", "control share", "fair price" or other similar anti-
takeover Law of any applicable jurisdiction shall become applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Seller, the Other Sellers,
Purchaser and the members of each of their respective boards of directors or
other governing bodies shall grant those approvals and take those actions as
are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby, and otherwise act
to eliminate or minimize the effects of any such Law on the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event
shall Purchaser or any of its Designees be required to propose, negotiate,
offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and
effect), by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of any material portion of the current
assets or businesses of Purchaser or its Designees or any material portion of
the Purchased Assets or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any
action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or
commit to take such action that materially limits its freedom of action,
ownership or control with respect to, or materially limits its ability to
retain or hold, any businesses, assets, properties or services of Purchaser
or its Designees in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction or restraining order in any suit or proceeding by a
Governmental Authority challenging the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as violative of any applicable antitrust or competition Law or
to remove or resolve any objection by any Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition Law
that may otherwise  



 

-36-  adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in an expeditious manner.

6.4 _Public Disclosures_.

Unless otherwise required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock
exchange or quotation service on which such partyÂ’s stock is traded or quoted,
prior to the Closing Date, no news release or other public announcement
pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be made by
or on behalf of any party or its Affiliates without the prior approval (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the content by the
other party. If in the judgment of either party such a news release or public
announcement is required by Law or the rules or regulations of any stock
exchange on which such partyÂ’s stock is traded or quoted, the party intending
to make such release or announcement shall provide prior notice to the other
party of such release or announcement and shall consult with the other party
with respect thereto, to the extent practicable.

Date, each party agrees to provide, or cause to be provided, to each other, as
soon as reasonably practicable after written request therefor and at the

comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on the
requesting party (including under applicable securities Laws) by
a Governmental Authority (including any Tax authority) having jurisdiction
over the requesting party, (ii) for use in any other judicial, regulatory,
administrative or other proceeding or in order to satisfy Tax, audit,
accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation or other similar requirements or
(iii) to comply with its obligation under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that any party determines that any such
provision of information could be commercially detrimental, violate any Law
or agreement, or waive any attorney-client, or other similar privilege, the
parties shall take all reasonable measures to permit the compliance with such
obligations in a manner that avoids any such harm or consequence.

(b) _Financial and Other Information_. Until the seventh anniversary of the
Closing Date, each Party shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the other
party hereto in such form as such requesting party shall reasonably request,
at no charge to such party, all financial and other data and information as is
reasonably necessary or advisable in order to prepare its financial
statements and reports or its filings, including Tax Returns, with any
Governmental Authority; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall be
required to provide or cause to be provided any financial or other data or
information if doing so would result in an undue burden on such party or
require the incurrence of an unreasonable expense by such party, except as
contemplated by Section 6.16.

(c) _Ownership of Information_. Any information owned by a party that is
provided to a requesting party pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be deemed to
remain the property of the  



 

-37-  providing party. Unless specifically set forth herein, nothing contained in
this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring rights of license
or otherwise in any such information.

(d) _Record Retention_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each party agrees
to use its reasonable commercial efforts to retain the books, records,
documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings, evidences of title
and other papers relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets (the "
_Books and Records_ ") in their respective possession or control for a
commercially reasonable period of time, consistent with their regular document
retention policies, following the Closing Date or for such longer period as
may be required by Law or until the expiration of the relevant representation
or warranty under any of the Transaction Documents and any related claim of
indemnification related thereto.

(e) _Limitation of Liability_. No party shall have any liability to any other
party in the event that any information exchanged or provided pursuant to this
Section 6.5 is found to be inaccurate except due to such partyÂ’s fraud. No
party shall have any liability to any other party pursuant to this Section 6.5
if any information is destroyed or lost after reasonable commercial efforts by
such party to comply with the provisions of Section 6.5(d).

 

(f) _Other Agreements Providing For Exchange of Information_. The rights and
obligations granted under this Section 6.5 are subject to any specific
limitations, qualifications or additional provisions on the sharing, exchange
or confidential treatment of information set forth in Section 6.2(b).

(g) _Confidential Information_. Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall require
either party to violate any agreement with any third parties regarding the
confidentiality of confidential and proprietary information; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that either party is required under this Section
6.5 to disclose any such information, that party shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to seek to obtain such third partyÂ’s consent to the
disclosure of such information.

6.6 _Employee Relations and Benefits_.

(a) For non-Automatic Transferred Employees:

(i) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and/or one of its Designees shall offer
employment to the Transferred Employees effective on the Closing Date
initially at the same location and on terms and conditions of employment that
are substantially similar in the aggregate (with respect to cash compensation
and benefits, but excluding equity incentive compensation) to those provided
to such employees by Seller or Other Sellers as of the date hereof (as
modified by any changes thereto made since the date hereof as permitted
pursuant to Section 6.1(e)), subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the
provisions regarding severance for Transferred Employees as set forth in
Section 6.6(a)(v);

(ii) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not engage in any activity intended to
discourage any Transferred Employee from accepting an offer of
employment from Purchaser and/or its Designees and shall not offer employment
with respect to any businesses of Seller or any  



 

-38-  Subsidiary (other than the Business) after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller and its Subsidiaries shall
be permitted to take any action they are legally required to take in order to
comply with local labor and employment Laws;

(iii) Section 6.6(a)(iii) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all
employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof that are
deemed " _Transferred Employees_ ," which schedule sets forth the name,
position and salary of such Transferred Employee. From time to time and in no
event later than the Closing, Seller shall provide notices of changes to such
list to reflect departures of such employees and new hires of employees with
responsibilities primarily related to the Business, who shall become
Transferred Employees;

(iv) For no less than six (6) months after the Closing Date, each Transferred
Employee shall participate in employee benefit plans, agreements, programs,
policies and arrangements of Purchaser and/or one of its Subsidiaries (the "
_Purchaser Plans_ ") on terms no less favorable than those provided to
similarly situated employees of the Purchaser and/or its Subsidiaries;

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, starting on
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, for a period ending on the date six (6)
months after the Closing Date, provide (or cause its Subsidiaries to provide)
each Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated during this six-
month period with severance pay and benefits at least comparable to the levels
of severance pay and benefits offered to similarly-situated employees under
SellerÂ’s severance plan, or, if applicable, its AffiliatesÂ’ severance plan,
as of the date hereof.

expenses and benefits with respect to claims incurred by Transferred Employees
or their covered dependents on or after the Closing Date. For purposes of this
paragraph, a claim is deemed incurred: in the case of medical or dental
benefits, when the services or supplies or medications that are the subject of
the claim are performed or provided, as applicable; in the case of life
insurance, when the death occurs; and in the case of short-term and long-term
disability benefits, when the disability occurs.

(c) Seller shall remain responsible and retain liability for workersÂ’
compensation claims and all other claims relating to occupational illnesses

Closing Date is short-term disabled or receiving or entitled to receive short-
term disability benefits and who subsequently becomes eligible to receive
long-term disability benefits, or (ii) as of the  



 

-39-  Closing Date is receiving or entitled to receive long-term disability
benefits, shall become eligible or continue to be eligible, as applicable, to
receive long-term disability benefits under the SellerÂ’s long-term disability
plan unless and until such individual is no longer disabled.

(e) Purchaser shall be responsible for any WARN Act (and similar state and
local Laws) Liabilities or Losses incurred by Seller arising as a result, in
whole or in part, of actions taken by Purchaser on or after the Closing Date.
Upon request from Purchaser, Seller shall provide Purchaser with such
information regarding any layoffs, terminations or other similar workforce
reduction matters as Purchaser reasonably requests for the purpose of
assessing potential WARN Act (and similar state and local Laws) Liabilities
or Losses of Purchaser (it being understood Seller need not provide any
information which would not be reasonably expected to be relevant to the WARN
Act (and similar state and local laws) Liability or Losses of Purchaser).
Seller shall otherwise retain full responsibility for any WARN Act (and
similar state and local Laws) Liabilities or Losses incurred by the Business
arising prior to the Closing Date.

(f) Purchaser shall not assume any equity compensation awards granted by

reasonably necessary for Purchaser to conduct the Business to the extent
conducted by Seller and the Other Sellers, collect any receivables acquired,
directly or indirectly, by Purchaser, or pay any Assumed Liabilities, in each
case after the Closing. From and after the Closing, Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that any monies inadvertently paid into
former receivables accounts of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries shall
automatically be transferred into applicable new receivables accounts of
Purchaser.

(e) The parties shall cooperate with each other, and shall use their good
faith efforts to cause their respective representatives to cooperate with
each other, to provide an orderly transition of the Business from Seller to
Purchaser and to minimize the disruption to the Business and each of their
respective businesses resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to
provide to Purchaser prior to the Closing such customer, vendor and similar
records information reasonably necessary for Purchaser to prepare
an accounting system for operation of the Business after the Closing and to
convert SellerÂ’s project management system (the " _Project Management System_
") from the Project  



 

-42-  Management Module of JD Edwards to the legacy system which is an excel
spreadsheet file (the " _Legacy System_ "), including account project codes
and transaction history. In exchange for such services, the requesting party
shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by such other party and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
foregoing obligation. In no event shall any party be required to take any
action contemplated by this Section 6.8(e) at any date following the ninetieth
(90th) calendar day following the Closing Date. Seller shall negotiate with
Purchaser in good faith to provide such further transition services as are
reasonably requested by Purchaser. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Seller shall provide to Purchaser reasonable "run off" services at
SellerÂ’s cost with respect to telephone, voicemail and office security matters
to the extent rights to such services are not otherwise Purchased Assets. 

6.9 _Non-Solicitation_.

without the prior written consent of Purchaser, solicit to hire (or cause or
seek to cause to leave the employ of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries)
(i) any Transferred Employee or (ii) any Person employed by Purchaser or its
Designee or any of their Subsidiaries who became known to or was identified to
Seller or any Subsidiary thereof in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, unless, in the case of clause (i) or (ii)

PersonÂ’s voluntary termination of employment with Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries, at least three (3) months prior to such action by Seller or any
Subsidiary.

(b) Purchaser agrees that for a period of one (1) year from and after the

is employed by Seller or any Subsidiary immediately following the Closing or
(ii) any Person employed by Seller and any Subsidiary who became known to or
who was identified to Purchaser or any of its Designees in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any Person involved in
the provision of services, with respect to whom the restriction set forth in
this Section 6.9(b) shall apply for a period of three (3) months following the
Closing), unless, in the case of clause (i) or (ii) above, such Person ceased
to be an employee of Seller or any Subsidiary prior to such action by
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, or, in the case of such PersonÂ’s
voluntary termination of employment with Seller or any Subsidiary, at least
three (3) months prior to such action by Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in Sections
6.9(a) and 6.9(b) shall not apply to bona fide public advertisements for
employment placed by any party and not specifically targeted at the employees
of any other party.



 

-43- 6.10 _Intellectual Property License Agreement_.

At the Closing, each of Seller and Purchaser shall execute and deliver (and,
if applicable, cause each Other Seller, Designee or Affiliate, to execute
and deliver) an intellectual property license agreement in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit G_ (the " _Intellectual Property License Agreement_ ").

6.11 _Insurance Matters_.

Purchaser acknowledges that the policies and insurance coverage maintained
on behalf of the Business are part of the corporate insurance program
maintained by Seller (the " _Seller Corporate Policies_ "), and such coverage
will not be available or transferred to Purchaser.

6.12 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Transfer Taxes_.

(i) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration, filing, recordation
(including the cost of recording the assignment or transfer of Intellectual
Property), ad valorem, value added, bulk sales, stamp duties, excise, license
or similar fees or taxes payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be
borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. Purchaser shall pay to Seller the
amount of any Taxes which it is required to remit pursuant to Section
6.12(a)(ii) no later than five days prior to the date such Taxes are
due. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other in the provision of
any information or preparation of any documentation that may be necessary or
useful for obtaining any available mitigation, reduction or exemption from any
Transfer Taxes. 

(ii) Any Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with any Transfer Taxes
shall be prepared by the party that customarily has primary responsibility
for filing such Tax Returns pursuant to the applicable Laws under and
according to which the respective Tax Returns are due to be filed. For Tax
Returns required to be prepared by Seller or any Other Seller pursuant to
this Section 6.12(a)(ii), Seller shall collect the proper Tax from Purchaser
and pay the Transfer Taxes shown on such Tax Return. Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide to Purchaser any Tax Returns which it is
required to prepare and file at least ten days before such Tax Returns are
due to be filed. For Tax Returns required to be prepared by Purchaser pursuant
to this Section 6.12(a)(ii), Purchaser shall collect the proper Tax from
Seller and pay the Transfer Taxes shown on such Tax Return. Purchaser shall
use reasonable best efforts to provide Seller any Tax Returns which it is
required to prepare and file at least ten (10) days before such Tax Returns
are due to be filed. Such Tax Returns shall be consistent with the allocation
of the Purchase Price as determined pursuant to Section 3.4.

(b) _Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_. 

(i) Seller shall remit when due or cause to be remitted when due any amount of
Taxes due in connection with the Purchased Assets and the Transferred
Business  



 

-44-  Intellectual Property Rights for any taxable period or any portion thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date. Seller shall duly file or cause to be
duly filed, any Tax Return required to be filed in respect of any Tax which
it is required to pay pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

(ii) Purchaser shall remit when due or cause to be remitted when due any
amount of Taxes due in connection with the Purchased Assets and the
Transferred Business Intellectual Property Rights for any taxable period or
any portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall prepare
and duly file or cause to be prepared and duly filed, any Tax Return required
to be filed in respect of any Tax which it is required to pay pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence. 

(iii) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed any Tax Returns with respect to the Purchased Assets and the
Transferred Business Intellectual Property Rights for taxable periods which
begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle
Period_ "). Such Tax Returns shall be prepared or caused to be prepared
by Purchaser consistent with the past practices and procedures of Seller for
preparation of such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall submit drafts of such Tax
Returns to Seller for approval by Seller no later than twenty (20) days prior
to the date that such Tax Returns are required to be filed with the
appropriate Governmental Authority, including extensions. In the event that
Seller and Purchaser cannot reach agreement with respect to any items shown on
such Tax Returns, a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable
to Seller and Purchaser shall prepare the Tax Returns. The costs related to
having the accounting firm prepare the Tax Returns shall be borne equally by
Seller and Purchaser. Purchaser shall make no election (including, without
limitations, an election under Section 338 of the Code) in connection with the
purchase of the shares of the Netherlands Subsidiary for any taxable period or
portion thereof ending prior to the Closing Date or the portion of any
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date without the prior written consent
of Seller. Seller shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the portion of the
Taxes shown on a Tax Return approved by Seller which relates to the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date promptly upon receiving
notice from Purchaser that Seller is liable under this Section 6.12 for such
Taxes but in no event later than five (5) Business Days before the Tax Return
reflecting such liability is required to be filed. For purposes of this
Section 6.12(b)(iii), in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that
relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date
shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period,
provided that appropriate adjustments shall be made for acquisitions and
dispositions and other transactions not in the ordinary course of business,
and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be
deemed to be equal to the amount which would be payable if the
relevant taxable period ended on and included the Closing Date. Any credits
relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though the
relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations
necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a
manner consistent with the prior practice of Seller (except as otherwise
required by Law).



 

-45- (iv) Seller and Purchaser shall allocate payment of property Taxes payable in
connection with the Purchased Assets and the Transferred Business
Intellectual Property Rights as of the Closing Date. Such allocation shall be
made in a manner similar to the allocation of Taxes payable for a Straddle
Period (as described in Section 6.12(b)(iii)), Purchaser and Seller shall
also cooperate with respect to the preparation and filing of any property Tax
Returns in a manner similar to the procedure for the preparation and filing of
Tax Returns for a Straddle Period (as described in Section 6.12(b)(iii)).

(c) _Cooperation and Assistance_.

(i) The parties shall cooperate with each other in the filing of any Tax
Returns and the conduct of any Tax audit or other proceeding. They each
shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and make available such
other documents as are reasonably necessary to carry out the intent of this
Section 6.12.

(ii) If either party is liable under this Section 6.12, for any portion of a
Tax shown due on any Tax Return required to be filed by the other party
pursuant to this Section 6.12, the party obligated to file such Tax Return
pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall deliver a copy of the relevant portions of
such Tax Return (taking into account any extensions, if applicable) to the
liable party. If the parties disagree as to the treatment of any item shown
on such Tax Return or with respect to any calculation with respect to any Tax
Return to be filed pursuant to this Section 6.12, an independent public
accounting firm acceptable to both Seller and Purchaser shall determine,
consistent with SellerÂ’s past practice (except as otherwise required by Law),
how the disputed item is to be treated on such Tax Return.

(iii) Upon request or upon payment, each party shall deliver to the tax
director of the other party certified copies of all receipts for any foreign
Tax with respect to which such other party or any of its Affiliates could
claim a foreign tax credit and any supporting documents required in
connection with claiming or supporting a claim for such a foreign tax credit.

(iv) Each party shall give any other party reasonable access to all such
records, documents, accounting data and other information as well as to its
personnel and premises to the extent necessary for a reasonable review or a
tax audit of such Tax Returns and relevant to an obligation under this
Section 6.12.

(d) _Tax Controversies_. A party shall notify the other party in writing
promptly upon (but in no event later than 30 days following) (a "
_Notification_ ") receipt of notice of any pending or threatened audits or
assessments with respect to Taxes for which such other party (or any of its
Affiliates) is liable under Section 6.12. Failure to give such Notification
shall not relieve the indemnifying party from liability under this Section
6.12, except if and to the extent that the indemnifying party is actually
prejudiced thereby. Each party shall be entitled to take control of the
complete defense of any tax audit or administrative or court proceeding (a "
_Tax Claim_ ") relating to Taxes for which it would be liable under this
Agreement and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense; _provided_ ,
that Seller and Purchaser shall jointly control the defense of any Tax Claim
relating to Taxes with respect to a Straddle Period for which Taxes are
allocated to both Seller and  



 

-46-  Purchaser under Section 6.12(b)(iii). Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, each party shall be entitled to take control of the
complete defense of any Tax Claim relating to Taxes for which it is obligated
to file a Tax Return (but does not have any indemnification obligation
hereunder) under this Section 6.12 (or by Law), and to employ counsel of its
choice at its expense;  _provided_ , that such party unconditionally releases
in writing the other party from its indemnification obligation hereunder with
respect to such Tax Claim; _provided_ _further_ , that such party shall take
control of such Tax Claim within 60 days of the earlier of (x) the date on
which such Notification is provided or (y) the date such Notification is due
pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.12. If one party takes
control of any such audit or proceeding, the other party shall be entitled to
participate, at its expense, in the defense of such audit or proceeding, and
the party controlling such audit or proceeding shall consider in good faith
any suggestions made or points raised by the other party. Neither party may
agree to any settlement of any claim for Taxes which could result in any
increase in the Taxes owed by the other party without the prior written
consent of such other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. This Section 6.12 shall govern to the extent it would
otherwise be inconsistent with Section 9.3(a).

6.13 _Notice of Breaches_.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Purchaser supplemental
information concerning events or circumstances occurring subsequent to the
date of this Agreement which would render any representation or warranty in
this Agreement or the Disclosure Letter inaccurate or incomplete in
any material respect at any time after the date of this Agreement until the
Closing. No such supplemental information shall be deemed to avoid or cure any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or constitute an amendment of any
representation, warranty or statement in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Letter.

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Seller supplemental
information concerning events or circumstances occurring subsequent to the
date hereof which would render any representation or warranty in this

the date of this Agreement until the Closing. No such supplemental information
shall be deemed to avoid or cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty
or constitute an amendment of any representation or warranty in this
Agreement.

6.14 _Mail Handling_.

Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser and/or its Affiliates shall have
the right to open all mail and packages delivered to it that is addressed to
Seller or any of the Other Sellers and that reasonably may be related to the
Business, the Purchased Assets, the Transferred Business Intellectual Property
Rights or the Assumed Liabilities. To the extent that Purchaser and/or any of
its Subsidiaries receives any mail or packages addressed to Seller or
any Subsidiary and delivered to Purchaser and/or any of its controlled
Affiliates not relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Transferred
Business Intellectual Property Rights or the Assumed Liabilities, Purchaser
shall  



 

-47-  promptly deliver such mail or packages to Seller. After the Closing Date,
Purchaser may deliver to Seller any checks or drafts made payable to Seller or
any Subsidiary thereof that constitutes a Purchased Asset, and Seller shall
promptly deposit such checks or drafts, and, upon receipt of funds, reimburse
Purchaser within five (5) Business Days for the amounts of all such checks or
drafts, or, if so requested by Purchaser, endorse such checks or drafts to
Purchaser for collection. To the extent Seller or any Subsidiary receives any
mail or packages addressed and delivered to Purchaser or to Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets, the
Transferred Business Intellectual Property Rights or the Assumed Liabilities,
Seller shall, or shall cause such Subsidiary to, promptly deliver such mail or
packages to Purchaser. After the Closing Date, Seller may deliver to
Purchaser any checks or drafts made payable to Purchaser or any Subsidiary
thereof that constitutes an Excluded Asset, and Purchaser shall promptly

Between the date hereof and the Closing, Seller shall provide to Purchaser
(i) within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month, interim
monthly financial statements for the Business that include a balance sheet and
a profit and loss statement and otherwise are in such form as Seller provides
to management of the Business on a monthly basis and (ii) within fifty (50)
days after the end of each calendar quarter, Seller shall provide Purchaser an
unaudited balance sheet and related profit and loss statement for
the Business as of the end of, and for the period of, such quarter
(collectively, the " _Interim Financials_ "). The Interim Financials shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the Interim Business Financial
Statements.

6.16 _Business Financial Statements_.

As promptly as possible and in no event commencing later than five (5)
Business Days following the Closing Date, Seller shall (a) at its own expense,
prepare balance sheets and related statements of income and cash flows of
the Business, together with all footnotes and schedules required by GAAP, as
of and for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 (the " _S-X
Financial Statements_ "), and for the nine months ending September 30, 2007
(the " _2007 Unaudited Financial Statements_ " and together with the S-X
Financial Statements or such other financial statements as contemplated by the
immediately following sentence, the " _Post-Closing Financial Statements_ "),
which Post-Closing Financial Statements shall be prepared (i) using
substantially the same basis of presentation as the Interim Business Financial
Statements, (ii) to include certain of the excluded costs as disclosed in
Section 4.13 of the Disclosure Letter to the extent they are required to be
included under GAAP, and (iii) in a manner meeting the requirements of
Regulation S-X adopted under the Securities Act and shall be suitable
for inclusion in a registration statement filed on Form S-1 under the
Securities Act; and (b) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to assist Deloitte
and Touche LLP (" _Deloitte_ ") in the completion of an audit of the S-X
Financial Statements and a review, consistent with the requirements of SAS
100, of the 2007 Unaudited Financial Statements, including executing such
management and other representation letters as shall be requested by
Deloitte, so that Deloitte is able  



 

-48-  to complete its audit and review of the Post-Closing Financial Statements.
The parties shall consult with one another, and reasonably discuss and agree
(in light of the actual date of the Closing and the intent of preparing
financial statements meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X adopted under
the Securities Act and which shall be suitable for inclusion in a registration
statement filed on Form S-1 under the Securities Act), on (x) any
modifications to the periods covered by the Post-Closing Financial Statements
are necessary, desirable or appropriate (including, where possible, a change
of the periods for which financial statements must be prepared by Seller),
and (y) any corresponding changes to the audits or reviews to be conducted by
Deloitte are necessary, in each case in order for such financial statements to
be in compliance with Regulation S-X adopted under the Securities Act in
connection with a registration statement filed on Form S-1. Promptly following
the date hereof, Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser to engage Deloitte, at
the expense of Purchaser (with the amount and terms of such engagement being
agreed to by Purchaser), to complete the foregoing audit and review of the
Post-Closing Financial Statements. Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Post-Closing Financial Statements to be delivered to
Purchaser no more than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Closing
Date. Seller shall, and shall cause each of its officers and employees to,
provide to Deloitte all information, documents and assistance reasonably
requested by Deloitte in connection with the audit and review of the Post-
Closing Financial Statements, and shall reasonably assist Purchaser in
preparing _pro forma_ financial statements that reflect the effect of the
acquisition by Purchaser of the Business for such periods as would
be required by Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the engagement letter with Deloitte to provide
for Deloitte, upon PurchaserÂ’s request, to assist with the preparation of the
_pro forma_ financial statements, to the extent necessary or appropriate as a
result of its audit and review of the Post-Closing Financial Statements.
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its officers to, execute and deliver
customary management representation letters to Deloitte and otherwise
cooperate with Deloitte in connection with DeloitteÂ’s audit and review of the
Post-Closing Financial Statements. Purchaser, in addition to paying the fees

September 30, 2008, Seller may satisfy and terminate its indemnification
obligations with respect to Purchaser Losses under Section 9.1(a)(i) upon the
payment to Purchaser of a single lump sum amount in cash equal to the sum of
(w) the full amount of any unsatisfied claims made by a Purchaser Indemnified
Party with respect to any Purchaser Losses under Section 9.1(a)(i) prior to

previously paid to a Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any Purchaser
Losses under Section 9.1(a)(i). The covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the date or dates specified
therein or, if not so specified, until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations with respect to the matters contained therein.

(h) Subject to the terms of the Indemnification Buyout, the obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto pursuant to Sections 9.1(a)(i) or
9.1(b)(i) shall cease to survive when the applicable representation or
warranty terminates pursuant to Section 9.2(g); _provided_ , _however_ , that

(i) If, at any time prior to the Termination Date (including, if appropriate,
as of the Closing), SellerÂ’s Adjusted Working Capital is less than the
Requisite Amount, Seller shall promptly provide notice (the " _Adjusted
Working Capital Notice_ ") regarding such matter to Purchaser. Within
three (3) Business Days of the date on which SellerÂ’s Adjusted Working
Capital falls below the Requisite Amount, Seller shall deposit into an escrow
account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") with a mutually acceptable escrow agent to
be selected by the parties prior to the Closing, or if such escrow agent is
not able to serve in such capacity, another mutually acceptable escrow agent
(the " _Escrow Agent_ ") an amount in cash equal to (i) the Liability Cap

prior to the Closing, with such changes as are necessary thereto as required
by the Escrow Agent). Promptly following the Termination Date or an
Indemnification Buyout, one hundred percent (100%) of the funds in the Escrow
Account, less any amounts that are subject to any unsatisfied claims made by
any Purchaser Indemnified Party (as evidenced by delivery of a written notice
(stating in reasonable detail the basis and amount of such claim) to Seller
and the Escrow Agent on or prior to the Termination Date or the date of the
completion of an Indemnification Buyout) that are the subject of a dispute
between Seller and Purchaser pursuant to any dispute resolution provision in
any escrow arrangement entered into by Seller and Purchaser with respect to
the funds in the Escrow Account, shall be released to Seller.

 

9.3 _Procedures for Third-Party Claims and Excluded Liabilities_.

(a) _General Procedures_. Promptly after the receipt by any Indemnified Party
of a notice of any claim, action, suit or proceeding by any third party that
may be subject to indemnification hereunder, including any claim relating to
any Excluded Liability or Assumed Liability, such Indemnified Party shall give
written notice of such claim to the indemnifying party hereunder (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), stating the nature and basis of the claim and the
amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies of the relevant
documents evidencing the claim and the basis for indemnification sought.
Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not



 

-58- relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this
indemnification, except if and to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced thereby. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver
to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified PartyÂ’s receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the claim. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of the
Indemnified Party against the third party claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and control the defense of
such third party action (x) if it elects to do so within ten (10) Business
Days following receipt of the notice with respect thereto and (y) so long as
the Indemnifying Party conducts such defense actively and diligently. The
Indemnifying Party may not assume the defense of a third party action if the
action of which it seeks to assume control (i)(x) seeks non-monetary relief
and (y) if such third party action, if determined adversely to the
Indemnified Party, could have a material adverse effect on such Indemnified
Party, (ii) involves criminal or quasi criminal allegations, (iii) involves a
claim which, upon petition by the Indemnifying Party, the appropriate court
rules that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously
prosecute or defend or (iv) involves a claim that is reasonably expected to
result in liability to the Indemnified Party in excess of the Indemnifying
PartyÂ’s indemnification obligation hereunder in light of the limitations set
forth in Section 9.2; _provided_ , however _,_ that, in the event that the
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a third party action pursuant to the
provisions of this sentence, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense of the third party claim, and may retain separate
co-counsel at its sole cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party elects to
assume the defense of a third party action, then, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not be required
to pay or otherwise indemnify the Indemnified Party against attorneysÂ’ fees or
other expenses incurred on behalf of the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense of such action following the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s election to
assume the defense. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense
of the third party claim in accordance herewith and notified the Indemnified
Party in writing thereof, (i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-
counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the
third party claim, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall pay
all reasonable costs and expenses of counsel for the Indemnified Party for
all periods prior to such time as the Indemnifying Party has notified the
Indemnified Party that it has assumed the defense of such third party claim
and after such time as the Indemnified Party has notified the Indemnifying
Party of such third party claim, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not file any
papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to the third party claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and (iii)
the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the third party claim (other than a
judgment or settlement that is solely for money damages and is accompanied by
a release of all indemnifiable claims against the Indemnified Party) without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed
the defense, such party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified
Party hereunder for any settlement entered into without the
Indemnifying PartyÂ’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to
assume the defense of an action contemplated by this Section 9.3(a) within the
manner contemplated above, or, if such action is assumed by the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnifying Party fails to conduct the defense actively and



 

-59- diligently, (A) the Indemnified Party may defend against the action in any
manner it reasonably may deem appropriate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party shall consult with, the Indemnifying Party in connection
therewith; (B) the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party
promptly and periodically for the reasonable costs of defending against the
action (including reasonable attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses) to the extent such
costs are Losses for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification therefor hereunder; and (C) the Indemnifying Party will
remain responsible for any costs the Indemnified Party may incur resulting
from the action to the extent such costs are Losses for which the Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification therefor hereunder;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in the event that it is determined that the Indemnified
Party was not entitled to indemnification for any costs that are Losses
hereunder, such Indemnified Party shall promptly refund to the Indemnifying
Party that portion of the amounts paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying
Party to such Indemnified Party in respect of reimbursement of such costs. In
the event that both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party are named
as defendants in an action and/or the representation of both parties by the
same counsel would not be inappropriate under applicable standards of
professional conduct, they shall both be represented by the same counsel (on
whom they shall agree), unless such counsel, the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party shall determine that such counsel has a conflict of
interest in representing both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
in the same action or proceeding and the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party do not waive such conflict to the satisfaction of such
counsel, in which case the reasonable expense of separate counsel for the
Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party.

(b) _Equitable Remedies_. In the case of (i) any third party claims where the
Indemnifying Party reasonably believes, and (ii) any Excluded Liabilities
where Seller is engaged in litigation or dispute resolution or settlement
negotiations and Seller reasonably believes, that it would be appropriate to
settle such claim using equitable remedies (i.e. remedies involving
the future activity and conduct of the Business), the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall consult in good faith on a reasonable settlement,
including any settlement that involves the licensing of Business Intellectual
Property Rights, accommodations on pricing terms and similar matters
affecting the future activity and conduct of the business. No party shall be
under any obligation to agree to any such settlement.

(c) _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any payment made pursuant to the
indemnification obligations arising under this Agreement shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Any indemnity payment under this
Agreement shall be decreased by any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnified Party under third party insurance policies with respect to such
Loss. If the amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under
this Agreement (an " _Indemnity Claim_ ") gives rise to a current deduction to
the party making the claim, the indemnity payment shall be reduced by the
amount of the Tax Benefit of such current deduction available to the party
making the claim. " _Tax Benefit_ " means, with respect to any indemnity
payment, the excess, if any, of (i) the Indemnified PartyÂ’s pro forma tax
Liability for the taxable year in which it accrues the indemnity payment,
calculated on the basis of the facts and circumstances actually pertaining to
the Indemnified Party, but assuming for purposes of this calculation that the
Indemnified Party had neither suffered the loss giving rise to the
Indemnification Claim nor accrued the indemnity payment, over (ii) the
Indemnified PartyÂ’s Adjusted Actual Tax Liability for such taxable year in
each case as  



 

-60-  calculated in good faith by the Indemnified Party. The " _Adjusted Actual
Tax Liability_ " is the actual Tax Liability of the Indemnified Party, taking
into account the items excluded from the calculation in clause (i).

9.4 _Certain Procedures_.

The Indemnified Party shall cooperate and reasonably assist the Indemnifying
Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by
the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. In connection
with any actual or threatened claims by, or actual or threatened litigation or
other disputes with, third parties relating to Excluded Liabilities or Assumed
Liabilities, any such claims, litigation and disputes being referred to as
"claims" for purposes of this Section 9.4, Purchaser and Seller shall
cooperate in the defense of such claim (and Purchaser and Seller agree with
respect to all Excluded Liabilities and Assumed Liabilities that a common
interest privilege agreement exists between them), including, (i) permitting
Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, to discuss the claim with such
officers, employees, consultants and representatives of the other party as
the requesting party reasonably requests, (ii) permitting Seller or Purchaser,
as the case may be, to have reasonable access to the properties, books,
records, papers, documents, plans, drawings, electronic mail, databases and
computers of the other party as the requesting party reasonably requests at
reasonable hours to review information and documentation relative to the
properties, books, records, papers, documents, plans, drawings, electronic
mail, databases and computers, contracts, commitments and other records of
such party, (iii) providing to Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, copies
of documents and samples of Products of the other party as the requesting
party reasonably requests, (iv) permitting Seller or Purchaser, as the case
may be, to conduct privileged interviews and witness preparation of officers,
employees and representatives of the of the other party as the requesting
party reasonably requests, (v) preserving all properties, books, records,
papers, documents, plans, drawings, electronic mail and databases relating to
Excluded Liabilities or Assumed Liabilities, as the case may be, until
notified in writing by the other party that such preservation is no longer
required, and preserving all other such information relating to Excluded
Liabilities or Assumed Liabilities, as the case may be, until the earlier of
(A) five years from the Closing Date and (B) the time when the party
requesting such preservation notifies the other party in writing that such
preservation is no longer required, (vi) promptly collecting documents and
extracting information from documents for SellerÂ’s or PurchaserÂ’s, as the
case may be, review and use, as such party reasonably requests, or allowing
SellerÂ’s or PurchaserÂ’s, as the case may be, representatives to do the same,
(vii) notifying Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, promptly of receipt
by such party of any subpoena or other third party request for documents or
interviews and testimony, (viii) providing to Seller or Purchaser, as the case
may be, copies of any documents produced by such party in response to or
compliance with any subpoena or other third party request for documents, and
(ix) permitting Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, to conduct such other
reasonable investigations and studies, and take such other actions, as are
reasonably necessary in connection with such partyÂ’s defense or investigation
of such claim. In connection with any claims, except to the extent
inconsistent with PurchaserÂ’s or SellerÂ’s obligations under applicable Law and
except to the extent that to do so would subject Purchaser or Seller, as the
case may be, or their respective employees, agents or representatives to
criminal or civil sanctions, (i) unless ordered by a court to do otherwise,
Purchaser and Seller, as the case may be, shall not  



 

-61-  produce documents to a third party until the other party has been provided a
reasonable opportunity to review, copy and assert privileges covering
such documents, (ii) the transfer by one party to the other party of
documents covered by attorney/client or work product privileges shall not
constitute a waiver of such privileges, (iii) unless otherwise ordered by a
court, each party shall withhold from production to any third party any
documents as to which the other party asserts a privilege, (iv) each party
shall defend in court any such privilege asserted by the other party and (v)
each party shall permit the other party to prepare any employees of such
party required or requested to testify or otherwise be deposed or interviewed
in connection with any claim and to be present during any such testimony or
interviews.

9.5 _Remedies Exclusive_.

Following the Closing, except (x) in the case of fraud or claims for
equitable relief, or (y) as otherwise provided in Section 6.7, Section 6.12 or
Section 11.3, the remedies set forth in this Article IX shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to claims resulting from or relating
to any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and shall be in lieu of any
other remedies that may be available to the Indemnified Parties under any
other agreement or pursuant to any statutory or common law (including
Environmental Law) with respect to any Losses of any kind or nature incurred
directly or indirectly resulting from or arising out of any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing shall not serve to limit any remedies of any party to any other
Transaction Document. Seller and Purchaser each hereby waive any provision of
any applicable Law to the extent that it would limit or restrict the agreement
contained in this Section 9.5.

9.6 _Mitigation and Insurance_.

(a) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate in good faith with each other with
respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is
obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or
liability.

 

(b) The amount of any Loss claimed pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or Section
9.1(b) hereunder shall be net of any amounts that the Indemnified Party
recovers under insurance policies or agreements with respect to such Loss. The
Indemnified Party shall take commercially reasonable actions to secure payment
from insurance policies, or any other Person responsible for such Loss, before
making a claim for any Loss to the Indemnifying Party.

ARTICLE X

(b) after six (6) months from the date hereof (the " _Outside Date_ ") by any
party by notice to the other party if the Closing shall not have been
consummated on or prior to such date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available
if such failure to consummate the Closing results primarily from a breach by
the terminating party of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in

(c) by any party, if a final order, decree or ruling enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement has been
issued by (i) any federal or state court in the United States having
jurisdiction or (ii) any similar court or Governmental Authority (unless such
order, decree or ruling has been withdrawn, reversed or otherwise made
inapplicable);

(d) by any party if any event, circumstance, condition, fact or effect has
occurred or exists which (i) would result in a failure of a condition to the
terminating partyÂ’s obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby set forth in Article VII (unless the failure results primarily from
the terminating party itself breaching any representation, warranty or
covenant set forth in this Agreement), and (ii) cannot reasonably be cured
prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that terminating party
shall have given the other party hereto written notice thereof, delivered at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to such termination stating its intention
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(d) and the basis
for such termination with reasonable particularity and providing the
opportunity to cure any breach giving rise to the effects set forth in clause
(i) and (ii) above; or

otherwise seeks such approval.

10.2 _Effect of Termination_.

In the event of any termination of the Agreement as provided in Section 10.1,

Purchaser for liability for any willful breach of any representation or
warranty, or the breach of any covenant or agreement, set forth in this
Agreement prior to termination; provided, further, that the obligations of
Purchaser and Seller under Sections 6.2(b) and 6.4, and Article XI of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive termination of
this Agreement.

MISCELLANEOUS AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES

11.1 _Dispute Resolution_.

Except as otherwise set forth herein, resolution of any and all disputes
arising from or in connection with this Agreement, whether based on
contract, tort, or otherwise (collectively, " _Disputes_ "), shall be
exclusively governed by and settled in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 11.1.

(a) _Negotiation_. The parties shall make a good faith attempt to resolve any
Dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement through negotiation.
Within 30 days after notice of a Dispute is given by either party to the
other party, each party shall select a first tier negotiating team comprised
of director or general manager level employees of such party and shall meet
and make a good faith attempt to resolve such Dispute and shall continue
to negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the Dispute or renegotiate
the applicable Section or provision without the necessity of any formal
proceedings. If the first tier negotiating teams are unable to agree within 30
days of their first meeting, then each party shall select a second tier
negotiating team comprised of vice president level employees of such party and
shall meet within 30 days after the end of the first 30 day negotiating period
to attempt to resolve the matter. During the course of negotiations under
this Section 11.1, all reasonable requests made by one party to the other for
information, including requests for copies of relevant documents, will be
honored. The specific format for such negotiations will be left to the
discretion of the designated negotiating teams but may include the preparation
of agreed upon statements of fact or written statements of position furnished
to the other party. All negotiations between the parties pursuant to this
Section 11.1(a) shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations.
Nothing said or disclosed, nor any document produced, in the course of such
negotiations that is not otherwise independently discoverable shall
be offered or received as evidence or used for impeachment or for any other
purpose in any current or future litigation.

(b) _Failure to Resolve Disputes_. In the event that any Dispute arising out
of or related to this Agreement is not settled by the parties within 15 days
after the first meeting of the second tier negotiating teams under Section
11.1(a), the parties may seek any remedies to which they may be entitled in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

(c) _Proceedings_. Nothing herein, however, shall prohibit either party from
initiating litigation or other judicial or administrative proceedings if such
party would be substantially harmed by a failure to act during the time that
such good faith efforts are being made to resolve the Dispute through
negotiation. In the event that litigation is commenced under this Section
11.1(a), the parties agree to continue to attempt to resolve any Dispute
according to the terms of Section 11.1(a) during the course of such
litigation proceedings under this Section 11.1(c).

-65- 11.3 _Bulk Transfers_.

Purchaser waives compliance by Seller or any Other Seller with the provisions
of all applicable Laws relating to bulk transfers in connection with the
transfer of the Purchased Assets. Notwithstanding any such waiver, Seller
agrees to indemnify Purchaser against all Liabilities or Purchaser Losses
which any Purchaser Indemnified Party may suffer due to the failure to so
comply or to provide notice required by any such Law.

11.4 _Severability_.

If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared by any court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, all other
provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected and shall remain in full
force and effect, and Seller and Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to
replace such illegal, void or unenforceable provision with a provision that
corresponds as closely as possible to the intentions of the parties as
expressed by such illegal, void or unenforceable provision.

11.5 _Further Assurances; Further Cooperation_.

Subject to the terms and conditions hereof (including Section 6.3), each of
the parties hereto agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to execute
and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all documents and to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions that may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of counsel for Seller and Purchaser, to
effectuate the provisions of this Agreement, provided that all such actions
are in accordance with applicable Law. From time to time, whether at or after
the Closing, Seller or its Subsidiaries (as appropriate) will execute and
deliver such further instruments of conveyance, transfer and assignment and
take such other action, at PurchaserÂ’s sole expense, as Purchaser may
reasonably require to more effectively convey and transfer to Purchaser any of
the Purchased Assets or Transferred Business Intellectual Property Rights and
Purchaser will execute and deliver such further instruments and take such
other action, at SellerÂ’s sole expense, as Seller or its Subsidiaries may
reasonably require to more effectively assume the Assumed Liabilities.

11.6 _Counterparts_.

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed
to be one and the same instrument. Copies of executed counterparts transmitted
by telecopy, telefax or other electronic transmission service shall be
considered original executed counterparts for purposes of this Section 11.6.

11.7 _Expenses_.

Whether or not the Closing occurs, Seller and Purchaser shall each pay their
respective expenses (such as legal, investment banker and accounting
fees) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.



 

-66- 11.8 _Non-Assignability_.

This Agreement shall not be assigned by either party hereto without the prior
written consent of the other party, and any attempted assignment,
without such consent, shall be null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser may, without the consent of Seller, assign any or all of its rights
and interests hereunder to one or more of its controlled Affiliates, provided
that Purchaser shall remain obligated to perform all of its obligations under
this Agreement if not performed by such Affiliates.

11.9 _Amendment; Waiver_.

This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified only by a
written instrument executed by the parties hereto. No waiver by either party
of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth
in writing and executed by the party so waiving. Except as provided in the
preceding sentence, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, or a failure or delay by any party
in exercising any power, right or privilege under this Agreement shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance
with any representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements contained
herein, and in any documents delivered or to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement and in connection with the Closing hereunder. The waiver by any
party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate
or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.

11.10 _Specific Performance_. 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any
provision of this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto was not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

11.11 _Third Parties_.

The terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit
of each party hereto and their respective successors or permitted assigns. It
is not the intention of the parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights,
and this Agreement does not confer any such rights, upon any other Person.

11.12 _Governing Law_.

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any conflicts of law
principles.



 

-67- 11.13 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

Each party hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States District Court located in New Castle County, Delaware, or if
such court does not have jurisdiction, the superior courts of the State of
Delaware located in New Castle County, for the purposes of any suit, action or
other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby. Each of the parties hereto, further agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such partyÂ’s
respective address set forth in Section 11.2 shall be effective service of
process for any action, suit or proceeding in the State of Delaware with
respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth
above in the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the parties hereto,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue
of any action, suit or proceeding set forth above arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waive trial by jury in any legal action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other agreement entered into in
connection therewith and for any counterclaim with respect thereto.

11.14 _Entire Agreement_. 

The Transaction Documents, Annex A, the Disclosure Letter and the Exhibits
hereto and any other agreements between Purchaser and Seller entered into on
the date hereof set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and there are no agreements,
understandings, representations or warranties between the parties or
their respective Subsidiaries other than those set forth or referred to
herein or therein. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of
this Agreement, any Real Property Agreement, the Transition Services
Agreement, the Intellectual Property License Agreement, or any Ancillary
Agreement, the provisions of such other agreement shall prevail, except that
disclaimers of warranties and limitations of liability in any agreement will
only apply to that agreement and will not affect another agreement unless
expressly stated otherwise.

11.15 _Responsibility for Subsidiary Breach_.

Each party hereto shall be responsible for ensuring that its Subsidiaries
(including, in the case of Seller, the Other Sellers) adhere to the terms
of this Agreement as if such Subsidiaries were original parties hereto and
shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by such Subsidiaries.
The foregoing obligation shall not limit the remedies available to any party
hereto for any breach of this Agreement by the other partyÂ’s Subsidiaries.



 

-68- 11.16 _Section Headings; Table of Contents_.

The section headings contained in this Agreement and the Table of Contents to
