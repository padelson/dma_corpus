ARTICLE III 
CONSIDERATION

 

3.1Conversion of Capital Stock.

 

(a)Conversion of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Purchaser, Merger Sub,
the Company or the Stockholders, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting
Shares) shall be canceled and automatically converted into the right to
receive, without interest, (i) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio plus (ii) the number of Earnout Shares, if any,
that may be issuable from time to time with respect to such share of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Section
3.3.

 

(b)Conversion of Shares of Merger Sub. Each share of Merger Sub that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by virtue
of the Merger and without further action on the part of the sole stockholder
of Merger Sub, be converted into and become one share of the Surviving
Corporation (and the shares of Surviving Corporation into which the shares of
Merger Sub are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving
Corporation that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective
Time). Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub will, as
of the Effective Time, be deemed to evidence ownership of such shares of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(c)Shares of Dissenting Holders. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock held
by a person (a "Dissenting Holder") who has not voted in favor of, or
consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and has complied with all the
provisions of the DGCL or other applicable law concerning the right of holders
of Dissenting Shares to demand appraisal of their shares (the "Appraisal
Provisions") of Company Common Stock, to the extent the Appraisal Provisions
are applicable, shall not be converted into the right to receive shares of
Purchaser Common Stock as

 



 

    



 |  

10

 |  



  
---|---|--- 
 

   

set forth in Section 3.1(a), but instead shall become the right to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Holder
pursuant to the procedures set forth in the DGCL or other applicable law. If
such Dissenting Holder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect
or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL or
other applicable law, each of such Dissenting Holder's shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive shares of Purchaser
Common Stock as set forth in Section 3.1(a). The Company shall give the
Purchaser prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of shares received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to the DGCL or other applicable law and shall give the Purchaser the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
thereto. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands.

 

(d)Treatment of Company Common Stock Owned by the Company. At the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as
treasury shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.

 

(e)No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
3.1, no party hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

 

(f)Surrender of Certificates. All Closing Payment Shares issued upon the
surrender of shares of the Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof, shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such securities, other than any additional rights pursuant to
this Agreement, provided that any restrictions on the sale and transfer of
such shares shall also apply to the Closing Payment Shares so issued in
exchange.

 

(g)Lost or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any certificates shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates or securities, as the
case may be, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, such securities, as may be required pursuant to this Section 3.1.

 

3.2Issuance of Closing Payment Shares and Earnout Shares.

 

(a)No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Purchaser Common
Stock will be issued pursuant to the Merger, and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
stockholder of the Purchaser.

 

(b)Legend. Each certificate issued to any holder of Company Common Stock in
connection with the Merger shall bear the legend set forth below, or legend
substantially equivalent thereto, together with any other legends that may be
required by any securities laws at the time of the issuance of the Purchaser
Common Stock:

 

THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED

11

 |  



  
---|---|--- 
 

   

STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT") OR THE SECURITIES LAWS
OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION, AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL (I) SUCH OFFER, SALE,
TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION HAS BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT AND THE
SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION COVERING SUCH SECURITIES OR
(II) THE ISSUER OF THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAS RECEIVED AN OPINION OF
COUNSEL IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE
OR TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATION IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT AND SUCH
OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS.

 

3.3Earnout Shares. The Stockholders shall be entitled to receive, as
additional consideration for the Merger and without any action on the part of
the Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or the Stockholders, additional shares
of Purchaser Common Stock (the "Earnout Shares") as set forth below. At the
time any such Earnout Shares are earned and become issuable as provided below,
(i) a total of 90.6% (rounded to the nearest whole share) of the Earnout
Shares then earned and issuable shall be issued to the Stockholders on a pro-
rata basis based on their Stockholder Per Share Percentage, and (ii) the
remaining Earnout Shares that would otherwise have been issuable shall not be
issuable to the Stockholders but in lieu thereof the number of authorized
shares available for issuance under the Purchaser Equity Plan shall be
automatically increased by an equivalent number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock.

 

(a)Following the Closing Date, if the daily volume weighted average price of
Purchaser Common Stock in any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period
prior to the forty-two (42) month anniversary of the Closing Date is greater
than or equal to $20.00 per share (the "First Earnout"), then the Stockholders
shall be entitled to receive such number of additional shares of Purchaser
Common Stock as equals the quotient of $20,000,000 divided by the Closing
Price Per Share.

 

(b)Following the Closing Date, if the daily volume weighted average price of
Purchaser Common Stock in any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period
prior to the six (6) year anniversary of the Closing Date is greater than or
equal to $35.00 per share (the "Second Earnout"), then the Stockholders shall
be entitled to receive such number of additional shares of Purchaser Common
Stock as equals the quotient of $20,000,000 divided by the Closing Price Per
Share.

 

(c)Following the Closing Date, if the daily volume weighted average price of
Purchaser Common Stock in any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period
prior to the eight (8) year anniversary of the Closing Date is greater than or
equal to $45.00 per share (the "Third Earnout" and together with the First
Earnout and Second Earnout, the "Earnouts"), then the Stockholders shall be
entitled to receive such number of additional shares of Purchaser Common Stock
as equals the quotient of $20,000,000 divided by the Closing Price Per Share.

 

(d)In the event that after the Closing Date and during the period when any
Earnout may still be earned (the "Earnout Period"), there is a Change of
Control, then any Earnout

 



 

    



 |  

12

 |  



  
---|---|--- 
 

   

Shares that the Stockholders would have been entitled to receive pursuant to
the First Earnout, the Second Earnout or the Third Earnout, as applicable,
determined based on whether the aggregate consideration to be received by the
Stockholders in exchange for a share of Purchaser Common Stock in such Change
of Control equals or exceeds the applicable stock price threshold set forth in
the applicable Earnout(s), shall be deemed earned with respect to the
applicable Earnout(s) and issuable by the Purchaser to the Stockholders
immediately prior to consummation of such Change of Control transaction (and
in such event the percentage in clause (i) of Section 3.3 shall be 90.6% for
all Earnout Shares thereby becoming issuable or such higher percentage as the
board of directors of the Purchaser at that time may determine). By way of
example, if such aggregate consideration is $25.00 and the First Earnout has
not previously been earned and issued, the first Earnout shall be deemed
earned and issuable but not the Second or Third Earnout. Any Earnouts not
achieved in connection with the Change of Control shall be canceled and of no
further force or effect. For purposes hereof, a "Change of Control" means the
occurrence in a single transaction or as a result of a series of related
transactions, of one or more of the following events: (i) a merger,
consolidation, reorganization or similar business combination transaction
involving the Purchaser in which the holders of all of the outstanding equity
interests of the Purchaser immediately prior to the consummation of such
transaction do not directly own, beneficially or of record, immediately upon
the consummation of such transaction, outstanding equity interests that
represent a majority of the combined outstanding voting securities of the
surviving entity in such transaction or a parent of the surviving entity in
such transaction; (ii) a transaction in which a majority of the Purchaser's
voting securities are transferred to any Person, or any two more Persons
acting as a group, and all Affiliates of such Person or Persons (each, a
"Group"); or (iii) the consummation of the sale of substantially all of the
assets of the Purchaser to any Person or Group.

 

(e)The maximum aggregate Earnout Shares, assuming the achievement of each
Earnout, is equal to the quotient of $60,000,000 divided by the Closing Price
Per Share. Each Earnout shall only be earned one time, on the first instance
that each applicable Earnout is earned, but each Earnout can be earned
independently of any other Earnout. The Stockholders shall be entitled to
receive, and the Purchaser shall issue, the applicable Earnout Shares promptly
(but no later than five (5) Business Days) following the date the applicable
Earnout is earned.

 

(f)At all times during the Earnout Period, the Purchaser shall keep available
and reserved for issuance a sufficient number of authorized but unissued
shares of Purchaser Common Stock to permit the Purchaser to satisfy the
issuance of the Earnout Shares that may still be earned and issuable and shall
take all commercially reasonable actions required to increase the authorized
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock if at any time there shall be
insufficient unissued shares of Purchaser Common Stock to permit such
reservation.

 

(g)All share and per share amounts shall be proportionally adjusted for stock
splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar events. All
distributions of Purchaser Common Stock with respect to the Earnout Shares
during the Earnout Period, including, but not limited to, shares of Purchaser
Common Stock issued as a result of stock splits, stock dividends,
recapitalizations and similar events, shall be deemed to be Earnout Shares and
shall be set aside and not issued until the Earnout Shares have been issued to
the Stockholders or, if the Earnout Shares are not earned and issued, then all
such distributions declared during such period shall be forfeited.

conformity with U.S. GAAP applied on a consistent basis, the financial
position of the Purchaser as of the dates thereof and the results of
operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of the Purchaser for
the periods reflected therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,

the aggregate, material). No financial statements other than those of the
Purchaser are required by U.S. GAAP to be included in the consolidated
financial statements of the Purchaser, and the Purchaser has no off-balance
sheet arrangements that are not disclosed in the Purchaser SEC Reports.

believes is sufficient, to provide reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions

authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP and to
maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to assets is permitted only
in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and (iv)
the recorded accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at
reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any
differences.

procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act),
which (i) are designed to ensure that material information relating to the

principal financial officer by others, and (ii) are effective in all material
respects to perform the functions for which they were established. Since

the Purchaser's inception, there have been no significant deficiencies or
material weakness in the Purchaser's internal control over financial reporting
(whether or not remediated) and no change in the Purchaser's internal control
over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Purchaser's internal control over financial
reporting.

 

(e)Except as described in the Purchaser SEC Documents, there are no
transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings between any of
Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any director,
officer, employee, stockholder, warrant holder or Affiliate of Purchaser or
any of its subsidiaries. The Purchaser has not taken any action prohibited by
Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

 

5.13Certain Business Practices. Neither the Purchaser Parties, nor any

employees, to foreign or domestic political parties or campaigns or violated
any provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or (iii) made any

officer, agent or employee of the Purchaser Parties (nor any Person acting on
behalf of any of the foregoing, but solely in his or her capacity as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Purchaser Parties) has, since the
IPO, directly or indirectly, given or agreed to give any gift or similar
benefit in any material amount to any customer, supplier, governmental
employee or other Person who is or may be in a position to help or hinder the
Purchaser parties or assist the Purchaser Parties in connection with any
actual or proposed transaction, which, if not given or continued in the
future, would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the business or
prospects of the Purchaser Parties and would reasonably be expected to subject
the Purchaser Parties to suit or penalty in any private or governmental
litigation or proceeding.

 

5.14Money Laundering Laws. The operations of the Purchaser Parties are and
have been conducted at all times in compliance with the Money Laundering Laws,
and no Action involving the Purchaser Parties with respect to the Money
Laundering Laws is pending or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened.

 

5.15Absence of Changes. Since its formation, the Purchaser has (a) conducted
no business other than its formation, the public offering of its securities
(and the related private offerings), public reporting and its search for an
acquisition as described in the prospectus for its IPO prospectus (including
the investigation of the Company and the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement) and related activities, and (b) not been subject to a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

5.16Contracts. Other than this Agreement and the Additional Agreements, there
are no Contracts to which any of the Purchaser Parties is a party or by which
any of their properties or assets may be bound, subject or affected, which
creates or imposes a liability greater than $100,000, that prohibits,
prevents, restricts or impairs in any material respect any business practice
of the Purchaser or any acquisition of material property by the Purchaser, or
that restricts in any material respect the ability of the Purchaser from
engaging in business as currently conducted by it or from competing with any
other Person (each such contract, a "Purchaser Material Contract"). All
Purchaser Material Contracts have been made available to the Company other
than those that

 



 

    



 |  

35

 |  



  
---|---|--- 
 

   

are exhibits to the Purchaser SEC Documents. With respect to each Purchaser
Material Contract: (a) the Purchaser Material Contract is legal, valid,
binding and enforceable in all material respects against the Purchaser and, to
the knowledge of the Purchaser, the other parties thereto, and is in full
force and effect; (ii) the Purchaser is not in breach or default, and no event
has occurred that with the passage of time or giving of notice or both would
constitute such a breach or default by the Purchaser Parties, or permit
termination or acceleration by the other party; and (iii) to the knowledge of
the Purchaser, no other party to any Purchaser Material Contract is in breach
or default in any material respect, and no event has occurred that with the
passage of time or giving of notice or both would constitute such a breach or
default by such other party, or permit termination or acceleration by the
Purchaser under any Purchaser Material Contract.

 

5.17Litigation. There is no Action that would be material to the Purchaser
pending against, or to the knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened in writing
against or affecting, the Purchaser Parties, any of their officers or
directors with respect to the business of the Purchaser or any securities of
the Purchaser or any of the assets of the Purchaser Parties or any Purchaser
Material Contract before any court, Authority or official or which in any
manner challenges or seeks to prevent or enjoin the transactions contemplated
hereby or by the Additional Agreements. There are no outstanding judgments
against the Purchaser Parties that would be, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.18Employees and Employee Benefit Plans. The Purchaser Parties do not (a)
have any paid employees, or (b) maintain, sponsor, contribute to or otherwise
have any liability under, any Plans.

 

5.19Insurance. The Purchaser is insured by financially sound institutions
with policies in such amounts and with such deductibles and covering such
risks as are customarily carried by Persons conducting a business similar to
the Purchaser.

 

5.20Taxes. The Purchaser Parties have or will have timely filed, or caused to
be timely filed (taking into account valid extensions), all income and other
material Tax Returns required to be filed by it, except where the failure to
so file would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, which Tax Returns are correct and complete in
all material respects, and has paid all Taxes required to be paid by the
Purchaser Parties other than such Taxes for which adequate reserves in the
Purchaser Financials have been established, and except for such Taxes the non-
payment of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no Actions pending
against the Purchaser Parties in respect of any material Tax, and the
Purchaser Parties have not been notified in writing of any proposed material
Tax claims or assessments against the Purchaser Parties (other than, in each
case, claims or assessments that have been settled or otherwise resolved in
full). The Purchaser Parties have not taken any action, and do not have any
knowledge of any fact or circumstance, that could reasonably be expected to
prevent the transactions contemplated hereby from qualifying as a
"reorganization" for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(1) of the Code.

 

5.21Independent Investigation. Each of the Purchaser Parties is a
sophisticated purchaser and has made its own independent investigation, review
and analysis regarding the Company and transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Additional Agreements, which

 



 

    



 |  

36

 |  



  
---|---|--- 
 

   

investigation, review and analysis were conducted by the Purchaser Parties
together with expert advisors. Neither of the Purchaser Parties is relying on

stockholders, affiliates or representatives shall have any liability to the
Purchaser Parties or any of their respective stockholders, affiliates or

memoranda, data rooms, management presentations, due diligence discussions or

definitive Proxy Statement for the sole purpose of obtaining approval of the
Purchaser Stockholder Matters (including any adjournment of such meeting for
the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of such Purchaser
Stockholder Matters) and such other matter as may be agreed by the Company.

its stockholders proxies in favor of the Purchaser Stockholder Matters and

similar information. The parties acknowledge that some previously confidential
information will be required to be disclosed in the Proxy Statement and any
other SEC filings.

the Company.

 

(d)Unless otherwise specified, any reference to any agreement (including this
Agreement), instrument, or other document includes all schedules, exhibits, or
other attachments referred to therein, and any reference to a statute or other
law includes any rule, regulation, ordinance, or the like promulgated
thereunder, in each case, as amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise
modified from time to time. Any reference to a numbered schedule means the
same-numbered section of the disclosure schedule. Any reference in a schedule
contained in the disclosure schedules delivered by a party hereunder shall be
deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of)
the applicable representations and warranties (or applicable covenants) that
are contained in the section of this Agreement that corresponds to such
schedule and any other representations and warranties of such party that are
contained in this

Agreement to which the relevance of such item thereto is reasonably apparent
on its face. The mere inclusion of an item in a schedule as an exception to
(or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item would have
a Material Adverse Effect or establish any standard of materiality to define
further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(e)If any action is required to be taken or notice is required to be given
within a specified number of days following a specific date or event, the day
of such date or event is not counted in determining the last day for such
action or notice. If any action is required to be taken or notice is required
to be given on or before a particular day which is not a Business Day, such
action or notice shall be considered timely if it is taken or given on or
before the next Business Day.

 

(f)Captions are not a part of this Agreement, but are included for
convenience, only.

 

(g)For the avoidance of any doubt, all references in this Agreement to "the
knowledge" of a party or similar terms shall be deemed to include the actual
or constructive (e.g., implied by Law) knowledge of the directors and officers
of such party.

 

12.12Further Assurances. Each party shall execute and deliver such documents
and take such action, as may reasonably be considered within the scope of such
party's obligations hereunder, necessary to effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

12.13Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 8.6 and Section
12.16, neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof confers any benefit or
right upon or may be enforced by any Person not a signatory hereto.

 

12.14Waiver. Reference is made to the final prospectus of the Purchaser, dated
March 5, 2020 (the "Prospectus"). Each of the Company and the Stockholders'
Representative, for herself and on behalf of the Stockholders, has read the
Prospectus and understands that the Purchaser has established the Trust
Account for the benefit of the public stockholders of the Purchaser and the
underwriters of the IPO pursuant to the Trust Agreement and that, except for a
portion of the interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account, the
Purchaser may disburse monies from the Trust Account only for the purposes set
forth in the Trust Agreement. For and in consideration of the Purchaser
agreeing to enter into this Agreement, each of the Company and the
Stockholders' Representative, for herself and on behalf of the Stockholders,
hereby agrees that it does not have any right, title, interest or claim of any
kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account and hereby agrees that it will
not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any claim it may have in the
future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or
agreements with the Purchaser.

 

12.15Stockholders' Representative. Raquel Izumi has been appointed by the
Stockholders as agent and attorney-in-fact for each Stockholder, (i) to give
and receive notices and communications to the Purchaser for any purpose under
this Agreement and the Additional Agreements, (ii) to agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of and demand arbitration and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to any disputes

arising under or related to this Agreement, (iii) to act on behalf of
Stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, the
securities described herein and any other document or instrument executed in
connection with the Agreement and the Merger, and (vi) to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders' Representative
for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the
Stockholders from time to time upon no less than twenty (20) days prior
written notice to the Purchaser; provided, however, that the Stockholders'
Representative may not be removed unless holders of at least 51% of all of the
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time agree
to such removal. Any vacancy in the position of Stockholders' Representative
may be filled by approval of the holders of at least 51% of all of the Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any removal
or change of the Stockholders' Representative shall not be effective until
written notice is delivered to the Purchaser. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholders' Representative, and the Stockholders' Representative shall not
receive any compensation for her services. Notices or communications to or
from the Stockholders' Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Stockholders. The Stockholders' Representative shall not be liable for any act
done or omitted hereunder while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable business judgment. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders' Representative shall, for all purposes hereunder, constitute a
decision, act, consent or instruction of all of the Stockholders of the
Company and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each of the
Stockholders. The Stockholders shall severally indemnify the Stockholders'
Representative and hold her harmless against any loss, liability, or expense
incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholders' Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of her duties hereunder.

 

12.16Non-Recourse. This Agreement may be enforced only against, and any
dispute, claim or controversy based upon, arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought only against,
the entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with
respect to the specific obligations set forth in this Agreement with respect
to such party. No past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, shareholder, agent, attorney, advisor, lender
or representative or Affiliate of any named party to this Agreement (which
Persons are intended third party beneficiaries of this Section 12.16) shall
have any liability (whether in contract or tort, at law or in equity or
otherwise, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose liability of an
entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of such named party or for any dispute, claim or controversy based
on, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the Additional Agreements
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

12.17No Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. None of the
representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or other agreements in
this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of
such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and other
provisions, shall survive the Closing and all such representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations or other agreements shall terminate and
expire upon the occurrence of the Closing (and there shall be no liability
after the Closing in respect thereof), except for those covenants and
agreements contained herein that by their terms expressly apply in whole or in
part after the Closing and then only with respect to any breaches occurring
after the Closing.
