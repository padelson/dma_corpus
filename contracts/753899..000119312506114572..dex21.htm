successors and permitted assigns and, except as provided in Article II and Section&nbsp;5.10, nothing in this Agreement express or implied is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment in violation of this Section&nbsp;8.6 shall be
null and void and of no effect, provided, that Parent or Merger Sub may assign any of their respective rights and obligations to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may
be, of its obligations hereunder. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Section&nbsp;8.7 <U>Governing Law</U>. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance

The parties hereto agree that any Legal Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be exclusively brought in (a)&nbsp;the
courts of the State of Nevada or (b)&nbsp;the Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State of Nevada, and each of the parties consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in
any such Legal Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such Legal Proceeding in any such court or that any Legal Proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Legal Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service or process on such party as provided in Section&nbsp;8.2 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. Each party waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any Legal Proceeding based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Section&nbsp;8.9 <U>Specific Performance</U>. The
parties hereby acknowledge and agree that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement and that each party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunction or specific performance, as a remedy for any such
breach. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Section&nbsp;8.10 <U>Severability</U>. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the maximum extent possible. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
