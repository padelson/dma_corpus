(a) _Company Common Stock_. Each Share (other than Shares owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, Treasury Shares and
Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and represent the right to receive $15.00
(the "Per Common Share Amount") in cash and without interest thereon (subject
to any applicable withholding tax), upon surrender of the corresponding
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.10.



 

10 (b) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, no par value
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving

thereto, except, in all cases other than Shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.9(c), the right to receive the Per Common Share Amount upon
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.10.

Section 2.10 _Surrender of Certificates_. 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an
institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the
"Paying Agent") in accordance with an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the
Company to receive the funds necessary to make the payments contemplated by
Section 2.9, 2.11 and 2.12, and Parent shall, at or prior to the Effective
Time, deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of Shares, Current Options, and Warrants for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, cash in an amount sufficient to
make payments of the Per Common Share Amount upon surrender of Certificates
and Option Consideration and Warrant Consideration (such aggregate cash
consideration being deposited hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund").
The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make payments
out of the Payment Fund as provided for in this Article II and the Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. All expenses of the Paying Agent
shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Exchange Procedures for Company Common Stock_. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall mail, or shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail, to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates (collectively, the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (other than Shares held by Parent, Merger
Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Treasury Shares and Dissenting Shares) (i) a letter of
transmittal (a "Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify),
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for payment of the Per Common Share Amount. Upon surrender to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate for cancellation, together with such Letter
of Transmittal duly executed, and such other customary documents as may  



 

11  reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor by check an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the Per Common Share Amount for each Share
formerly represented by such Certificate. Such payment of the Per Common Share
Amount shall be sent to such holder by the Paying Agent promptly after receipt
by the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such Letter of
Transmittal duly executed, and such other customary documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, and the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
The right of any stockholder to receive the Per Common Share Amount, shall be
subject to and reduced by any applicable withholding obligation as set forth
in Section 2.14. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable upon the surrender of a Certificate.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock_. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.10, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Per Common Share Amount in respect of the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this Section 2.10. All
cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with
the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares represented by such
Certificates. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company, and if Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this
Article II.

(d) _Unregistered Transfer of Capital Stock_. If payment of the Per Common
Share Amount is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and any other Taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. In the event that any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Common Share Amount payable pursuant
to this Article II.

(f) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid as directed by Parent.
To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, Parent
shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost through
investments so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is maintained at a
level sufficient to make such payments.



 

12 (g) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the former holders of Company Common Stock one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand. Any such
holders who have not complied with this Article II prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent, and Parent shall thereafter be liable, for
payment of the Per Common Share Amount (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and similar Laws). Any such portion of the Payment Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Persons previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying
Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

Section 2.11 _Equity Compensation_.

(a) _Cancellation of Stock Options_. At or immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each Current Option, whether or not fully vested, shall be cancelled and
in lieu thereof, the holder of each such Current Option will be entitled
to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to the
product of (i) the excess, if any of the Per Common Share Amount over the
exercise price per Share under such Current Option multiplied by (ii) the
number of Shares subject to such Current Option, whether or not fully vested,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, without interest (the "Option
Consideration"), reduced by any income or employment taxes required to be
withheld under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.
On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company (and its board of directors)
shall obtain any consent of the holders of a Current Option required to cancel
such Current Option in exchange for the right to receive the Option
Consideration.

(b) _Restricted Stock_. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
outstanding rights of the Company to acquire unvested Shares issued pursuant
to the Equity Compensation Plans, whether or not exercisable at such time
shall lapse, and such unvested Shares shall be fully vested and cease to be
subject to forfeiture and repurchase by the Company, and any transfer and
escrow restrictions. Such Shares shall be subject to any income or employment
taxes required to be withheld under the Code or any provision of state, local
or foreign Tax law.

(c) _Amendment and Administration of Equity Arrangements_. As soon as
reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and
conditional upon the Closing, the Company (and its board of directors, or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall take all requisite actions and/or adopt
such resolutions as may be required in order to give effect to and accomplish
the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.11, including, without
limitation, amending each of the Equity Compensation Plans if and to the
extent necessary and practicable, to reflect the transactions contemplated by
this Section 2.11.

(d) _Withholding Taxes_. In accordance with this Section 2.11, the Surviving
Corporation will promptly pay or cause to be paid any amounts withheld
pursuant to this  



 

13  Section 2.11 for applicable foreign, federal, state and local taxes to the
appropriate Governmental Entity on behalf of such holders of the
applicable Current Options and the unvested Shares issued pursuant to the
Equity Compensation Plans.

Section 2.12 _Warrants._ At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
Warrant as to which the consent of the holder thereof has been obtained shall
be cancelled and in lieu thereof, the holder of each such Warrant will be
entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) the excess, if any of the Per Common Share Amount over the
exercise price per Share under such Warrant multiplied by (ii) the number of
Shares subject to such Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time,
without interest (the "Warrant Consideration"). On or prior to the Closing
Date, the Company (and its board of directors) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any consent of the holders of the
Warrants required to cancel the Warrants in exchange for the right to receive
the Warrant Consideration or to take such other actions that may be required
in order to give effect to and accomplish the transactions contemplated by
this Section 2.12. 

Section 2.13 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and that are held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly demanded
and perfected appraisal rights under Sections 92A.300 through 92A.500 of the
NRS (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive the applicable Per Common Share Amount but instead shall be
entitled to receive such payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect
to such Dissenting Shares as shall be determined pursuant to the NRS;
provided, however, that if such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or otherwise lost such holders right to appraisal
and payment under the NRS, each such Share held by such holder shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the
Per Common Share Amount in accordance with Section 2.9(a), and such Share
shall no longer be a Dissenting Share. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent of any written demands received by the Company for appraisals of any
Shares and attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to Section 92A.440 of the NRS and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as
provided in Section 92A.320 of the NRS, and Parent shall have the right to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisals of Shares, offer to settle or settle any demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.

Section 2.14 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Shares shall be changed into a different number, class or series
of shares by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, combination or exchange of shares, then the Per
Common Share Amount payable with respect thereto and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 2.15 _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to a holder of Shares or  



 

14  Stock Options pursuant to the Merger any amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Shares, Warrants or Stock Options in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except, with respect to any Section of this Article III, as set forth in the
section of the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent on the
date of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule") that specifically
relates to such Section or in another section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the text of such
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such Section, or as disclosed
by the Company in any publicly available report or document filed with the
SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State

existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has the requisite
corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it is presently
being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and assets. Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete and
correct copies of (a) the articles of incorporation and bylaws or other
constituent documents, as amended to date, of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries and (b) the minutes (or, in the case of draft minutes, the
most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings and actions taken by written
consent of the stockholders, the boards of directors of the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries and each committee of the board of directors of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2003 to the extent that
such written materials are available for such meetings. None of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of its articles of incorporation,
bylaws or other applicable constituent documents, except for such violations
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 3.2 _Subsidiaries_.

of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or voting
interest) that would prevent the operation by the Surviving Corporation of
such Subsidiarys business as presently conducted, other than Permitted
Encumbrances.

(c) There are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)
options, warrants, rights or other commitments or agreements to acquire from
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or that obligate the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest in, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of
the Company, (iii) obligations of the Company to grant, extend or enter into
any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security or
other similar agreement or commitment relating to any capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interest (including any voting debt) in, any
Subsidiary of the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), together
with the capital stock of the Subsidiaries of the Company, being referred to
collectively as "Subsidiary Securities") or (iv) other obligations by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or
value of any shares of any Subsidiary of the Company. There are no outstanding
agreements of any kind which obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding Subsidiary
Securities.

Section 3.3 _Authorization_. The Company has all requisite power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and subject, in
the case of the consummation of the Merger, to obtaining the
Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Voting Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no
additional corporate proceedings on the part of the Company and no other
stockholder votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Voting
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, other than in the case of the consummation of the Merger, obtaining
the Stockholder Approval. Other than with respect to obtaining
the Stockholder Approval in order to consummate the Merger, the Company has

and deliver this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and to perform the
obligations and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
Each of this Agreement and the Voting Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding

Disclosure Schedule, the Company has filed all forms, reports and documents
with the SEC that have from and after January 1, 2003 been required to be

Report complied, as of its filing date, as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, each as in effect on the date such SEC Report was filed,

all Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, whether or not

to file any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. No executive
officer of the Company has failed to make the certifications required of him
or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any

challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of
filing of such certifications.

except, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may be
permitted by the Exchange Act, and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended, provided that the unaudited interim financial
statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to normal year-end
adjustments, in each case as permitted by GAAP and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC.

(b) The management of the Company has (i) implemented disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that

Company and its Subsidiaries is made known to  



 

19  the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company by
others within those entities, and (ii) disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit committee
of the Board of Directors of the Company (A) all significant deficiencies and

employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting.

its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control

adverse effect on the Companys system of internal accounting controls.

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement or
any similar Contract (including without limitation any Contract relating to
any transaction, arrangement or relationship between or among the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand (such as any arrangement described in Section
303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)) where the purpose or effect of such
arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving the
Company or any its Subsidiaries in the Companys consolidated financial
statements.

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.7(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the
Companys knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant,
consultant or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any substantive complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has, on or after January 1, 2003, engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices (except for any of the
foregoing that have been resolved without any material impact). Since January
1, 2003, no current or former attorney representing the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has reported evidence of a material violation of securities

its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Companys board of
directors or any committee thereof or to any director or executive officer of
the Company.

Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on or after January 1, 2003. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
employee, contractor,  



 

20  subcontractor or agent of the Company or any such Subsidiary has discharged,
demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any other manner
discriminated against an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

with the SEC in connection therewith (collectively, as amended or
supplemented, the "Proxy Statement") will, when filed with the SEC, comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act. At the time the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement
thereto is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, the Proxy Statement will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing,
the Company does not make any representations or warranties with respect to
information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their officers,

by, any Third Party that has made or, to the knowledge of the Company, is
seeking to make, an Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of any of the restrictions
set forth in this Section 5.4(a) by any officer, director or employee of the

directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may
furnish information concerning the businesses, properties or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person or group, including
furnishing nonpublic information pursuant to an executed confidentiality
agreement, the terms of which are at least as restrictive as the terms
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and may engage in discussions and
negotiations with such Person or group concerning an acquisition only if: (A)
such Person or group has submitted an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal which the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith
is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal, (B) the board
of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be

such Person or group if such information has not been previously provided to
Parent. The Company shall instruct its investment bankers, attorney, agents
and other representatives that such Persons are not authorized to, and are

(b) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours, but in any
event prior to the same time on the next Business Day) notify Parent of any
Acquisition Proposal, any material modifications thereto or any request for
non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or for
access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Third Party that, to the knowledge of the Company, is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party
making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition
Proposal or request. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably
current basis of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal
or request, and shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours, but in any
event prior to the same time on the next Business Day) provide to Parent a
copy of all written materials subsequently provided to or by the Company in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal or request.

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the officers,

any Acquisition Proposal, shall terminate any access of any such Third Party
to any nonpublic information and shall request the return or destruction of
any nonpublic information provided to any such Third Party in connection with
any such activities, discussions or negotiations.



 

40 (d) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4(d), the board of directors of the

contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) enter into

(ii) of this Section 5.4(d) if (A) the Company has complied with this Section
5.4, (B) if any such actions are taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal
(and only in such cases), the board of directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law (taking into consideration any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of
this Agreement), and (D) the Company has provided Parent prior written notice
of its intent to take any such action at least three Business Days prior to
taking such action, or (y) enter into an agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal upon termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(d)(i) and concurrent payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to section 7.2(a)(iii).

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Company or its
board of directors, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries, from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders
a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party
pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
making any disclosure or recommendation to the Companys stockholders if,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the board of directors
determines in good faith that failure to take such action would result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders or violate
applicable law.

Section 5.5 _Access to Information_.

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time and subject to applicable Law,
upon reasonable notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its officers,
directors and employees to, (i) provide Parent, its lenders and their
respective authorized representatives and agents ("Authorized
Representatives") with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
facilities, properties, employees (including all accounting and finance
personnel responsible for the preparation of the Companys financial
statements, internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and
financial reporting processes), books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companys
and its Subsidiaries consultants and independent public accountants, to
provide access to their work papers and such other information as Parent may
reasonably request, (ii) furnish to Parent and its authorized representatives
such financial and operating data and other information with respect to the
business and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may from
time to time reasonably request; and (iii) furnish promptly to Parent a copy
of each report, schedule or other document filed or received by the Company
during such period pursuant to the  



 

41  requirements of the federal or state securities Laws. In furtherance of the
foregoing, from the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall
furnish to Parent on a monthly basis and within 25 days after the end of each
calendar month (except for the months of March, June, September and December),
unaudited balance sheets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and of each of the Companys Subsidiaries, individually, as of the end
of each such month, and the unaudited statements of operations for the month
then ended (the "Subsequent Monthly Statements") for such entities; provided
that the financial statements furnished pursuant to this Section 5.5(a) (i)
shall be complete and prepared in accordance with the books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) shall accurately reflect the assets,
liabilities and financial condition and results of operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for the respective
periods indicated therein, except as otherwise noted therein and subject to
normal and recurring year-end adjustments that will not, individually or in
the aggregate, be material, and (iii) shall have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto, and except that such Subsequent Monthly Statements may not contain
footnotes). In addition, to the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to permit Parent and its Authorized
Representatives the right to access the real properties subject to the
Option Agreements and to make inspections thereof and the right to inspect
information relating to such real properties (to the extent available to the
Company). The Authorized Representatives may perform such inspections and
investigations as they deem reasonably appropriate, provided that information
arising from such inspections and investigations is subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement and provided further that the Authorized
Representatives use diligent efforts to minimize interference with the
Companys business at its facilities and properties. Notwithstanding the
forgoing, the Company shall not be required to provide any information as to
which it notifies Parent that it reasonably believes it may not provide to
Parent by reason of contractual or legal restriction.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing in
this Section 5.5 shall require the Company or its Affiliates to disclose any
information to Parent if such disclosure would be in violation of applicable
Laws or agreements.

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and each of their respective
officers, directors, employees, financial advisors, counsel and agents

February 2, 2006 (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

Section 5.6 _Governmental Filings_. Each of Parent and the Company agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) make any filings required or
in Parents reasonable opinion advisable pursuant to the HSR Act and any
applicable foreign antitrust, competition or merger control Laws or Gaming
Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable, (b) supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and/or
any such applicable foreign Law or Gaming Laws and (c) take all other actions
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods or to obtain any Consents under the HSR Act, such foreign Law and/or
Gaming Laws, as soon as practicable. Each party shall keep the other parties
promptly apprised of any communications with, and inquiries or requests for
information from  



 

42  Governmental Entities in connection with such filings and shall permit the
other parties to review any material communication given by it to, and
consult with the other parties in advance of any meeting or conference with,
any such Governmental Authority, and to the extent permitted by such
applicable Governmental Entities, give the other parties the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. Nothing in this
Agreement, however, shall require or be construed to require any party hereto,
in order to obtain the consent or successful termination of any review of any
such Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, to
sell or hold separate, or agree to sell or hold separate, before or after the
Effective Time of the Merger, any material assets, businesses or any interests
in any material assets or businesses, of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, by
Parent or the Company, of any material assets or businesses, or any interests
in any material assets or businesses), or any material change in
or restriction on the operation by Parent or the Company of any assets or
businesses.

Section 5.7 _Approvals and Consents_. The parties shall cooperate with each
other and use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
Consents, including, without limitation, (a) all necessary Consents of any
Governmental Entity including both those described in Section 5.6 and the
Nevada Gaming Authority and (b) all Consents described in Section 3.5(b), in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in taking
such actions or making any such filings, the parties hereto shall furnish
information required in connection therewith and seek timely to obtain any
such Consents.

Section 5.8 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Parent agrees to provide, or to cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, for a period of 12 months after the Closing Date, employee benefits
to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries employed by the Surviving
Corporation on and after the Closing Date that are substantially similar, in
the aggregate, to the benefits provided under the Employee Plans (excluding
those plans that relate to equity compensation) prior to the Closing Date.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with their respective terms (as
in effect on the date of this Agreement), all the Companys employment,
severance and termination agreements, plans and policies disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Letter.

(c) With respect to any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including any severance
plan), for all purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting
but not for purposes of benefit accrual, service with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

(d) Parent shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitation under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
affiliates (other than the Company) in which employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate
from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent  



 

43  that such pre-existing condition limitation would have been applicable under
the comparable Company welfare benefit plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar
amount of all expenses incurred by each Company employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Merger Sub and Parent shall
consult with each other before issuing any press releases or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and none of the parties shall issue any press release or
make any public statement prior to obtaining the other parties
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
except that no such consent shall be necessary to the extent disclosure may be
required by Law, Order or applicable stock exchange or Nasdaq rule or any
listing agreement of any party hereto.

Section 5.10 _Indemnification; Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law (and Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses
as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, provided the
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification), each present and former director, officer and employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Persons")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however,
that Surviving Corporation shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnified
Person pursuant hereto if it shall be determined that the Indemnified Person
acted in bad faith and not in a manner such Indemnified Person believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. The articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall
cause the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation to contain,
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and exculpation
of present and former directors and officers of the Company than are
presently set forth in the Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws.

(b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain policies of directors and
officers liability insurance covering each Person who is now or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to
claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective
Time and providing at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms
that in aggregate are not less advantageous to the insured parties than those
contained in the policies of directors and officers liability insurance in
effect as of the date hereof (the "Current Policy Coverage"); provided,
however, that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend, per annum, in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such  



 

44  coverage (or such coverage as is available for 200% of such annual premium);
provided, further, that if the annual premium required to provide the
foregoing insurance exceeds 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company, the Surviving Corporation shall provide as much of such insurance as
can be purchased for such premium, and, any present or former officer or
director, upon reasonable written notice thereof from the Surviving
Corporation, who desires to be covered by the Current Policy Coverage may so
elect and shall be covered by the Current Policy Coverage so long as such
former officer or director pays the portion of the premium for such policies
in excess of the amount which the Surviving Corporation is obligated to pay
pursuant to this Section 5.10. If the Company in its sole discretion elects,
by giving written notice to Parent at least 60 days prior to the Effective
Time, then, in lieu of the foregoing insurance, effective as of the Effective
Time, the Company may purchase a "tail" or "runoff" policy that (i) has an
effective term of up to six years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers each
person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers insurance
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement for actions and omissions
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains terms that
are no less favorable than those of the Companys directors and officers
insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided that the
premium for such "tail" or "run off" coverage shall not exceed 200% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company.

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.10.

Section 5.11 _Obligations of Merger Sub; Voting of Company Common Stock_.
Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent shall vote any Shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in
favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

Section 5.12 _Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) contesting any Legal Proceeding
or Order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) executing any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) to the
extent deemed necessary by the Parties, amending this Agreement to provide for
the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub and the continuation of
Merger Sub as the surviving corporation in such merger. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur as soon
as practicable. If at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and
directors of each party hereto shall take all such necessary action. 



 

45 Section 5.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, of
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure
to occur would cause (a) (i) any representation or warranty of such party
contained in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality to be untrue
or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other representation or warranty of
such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure by such party
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. 

Section 5.14 _Landlord Estoppels_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from each landlord under a lease for the Leased
Real Property for the benefit of Parent an estoppel certificate in the form
required to be delivered by the landlord as specified in the underlying lease
or, if no form is specified, an estoppel certificate, substantially in
the form reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent (the "Estoppel
Certificate") certifying (a) the status of the underlying lease for the Leased
Real Property and of any amendments and addenda thereto and (b) the
absence of any default by the Company or its Subsidiary, as tenant, under the
lease for the Leased Real Property or, if any default is alleged to exist, the
nature of such default.

Section 5.15 _Option Agreement Estoppels_. The Company shall, prior to the
Effective Date, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an estoppel
certificate executed by each optionor under the Option Agreements pursuant to
which the optionor certifies that (a) except as specified therein, the Option
Agreement to which it is a party has not been amended and is in full force
and effect, (b) the Company is not in default in the performance of any of
its obligations under the Option Agreement, and (c) the transactions
contemplated herein will not constitute an impermissible assignment of the
option.

Section 5.16 _Title Insurance_.

(a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) deliver
an updated title report for each Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property
within fifteen (15) days after the date hereof and (ii) assist Parent in
obtaining, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, a policy of title insurance
(the "Title Policy") with respect to the Owned Real Property and the Leased
Real Property designated on Schedule 5.16 (the "Significant Real Property")
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

(b) The Company shall use its commercially reasonably efforts to cause the
Title Company to, promptly following the date hereof, deliver to Parent a
current commitment from the Title Company setting forth the basis upon which
the Title Company is willing to insure title to the Real Property (the
"Title Commitment"); provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be
required to execute a so-called mechanics lien or other indemnity to the
Title Company in connection with the issuance of any title policies requested
by the Parent, except that the Company will execute a so-called owners
affidavit in form acceptable to the Company in its sole, but reasonable
discretion, at the request of Parent in order to facilitate the issuance of
any such title policy(ies). All costs and expense incurred by the Parties in
connection with obtaining the Title Policies and Title Commitments pursuant to
this Section 5.16 shall be borne equally by Parent and the Company.



 

46 Section 5.17 _Environmental Reports_.

(a) If required by Parents Lender (as defined below), the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent Phase
I Investigations (as defined below), which reports shall be dated no earlier
than 6 months prior to the Closing Date, covering all of the Owned Real
Property and the Leased Real Property. If the Phase I Investigations contain
recommendations for further investigation of any Recognized Environmental
Condition, as defined in the 2000 American Society of Testing and Materials
(ASTM) standards for the performance of Phase I Environmental Site Assessments
(ASTM E 1527-00 or if requested by Parents Lender, pursuant to the American
Society for Testing and Materials Standard E 152705), and if Parents Lender
reasonably believes that such conditions require additional investigation,
then the remaining provisions of this Section 5.17 shall control. For
purposes of this Section 5.17, "Lender" shall mean the lender of the financing
necessary to fund the Payment Fund.

(b) In the event that Parent notifies the Company that (i) any Phase I
Environmental Assessment pursuant to the American Society for Testing
and Materials Standard E 152700 or if requested by Parents Lender, pursuant
to the American Society for Testing and Materials Standard E 152705 (Standard
Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental
Site Assessment Process) (each, a "Phase I Investigation") delivered to
Parent pursuant to Section 5.17(a) contain recommendations for further
investigation of any Recognized Environmental Condition, and (ii)
Parents Lender has informed Parent that a response to such further inquiries
is required in order to consummate the financing necessary to fund the Payment
Fund, the Company shall use commercially reasonable effort to cause to be
carried out by an assessor (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent) a
Phase II Environmental Assessment pursuant to the American Society for Testing
and Materials Standard E 190397 (2002) (Standard Guide for Environmental Site
Assessments: Phase II Environmental Site Assessment Process) (each, a "Phase
II Investigation") on each parcel of real property with respect to which there
was any such fact, matter or circumstance discovered or reported, and upon
completion of such Phase II Investigations, if any, the Company shall provide
copies to Parent of all reports and documents related thereto. All costs and
expense incurred by the Parties in connection with the reports and
investigations undertaken pursuant to this Section 5.17 shall be borne
equally by Parent and the Company.

(c) The Company hereby agrees that any Phase I Investigation or Phase II
Investigation provided to Parent by the Company pursuant to this Section 5.17
or otherwise may be provided to Parents advisers, representatives,
underwriters and agents for the purposes of consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the financing therefor.

(d) If any Phase II Environmental Report delivered by the Company pursuant
to Section 5.17(b) demonstrates that any Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property is not in compliance with all Environmental Laws applicable to such
property or that environmental remediation may be required by any applicable
Governmental Entity, then the Company shall promptly pursue any and all
rights it may have for indemnification for the losses caused by such non-
compliance or required remediation.

ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time whether before or
after obtaining the Stockholder Approval:

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;



 

49 (b) by either Parent or the Company if:

(i) the Merger shall not have been consummated by the date which is 9 months
after the date hereof; provided, however, that such date may be extended by
either party (by written notice thereof to the other party) up to and
including the date which is 12 months after the date hereof in the event all
conditions to effect the Merger other than one or more conditions set forth in
Sections 6.1(b) and (c) have been or are capable of being satisfied at the
time of each such extension (the latest applicable date shall be referred to
herein as the "Outside Date"); provided, that no party may terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(i) if such partys breach of this
Agreement shall have been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of
the Merger to be consummated on or before such date; or

(ii) (A) there shall be any applicable United States Law that makes the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited;
_provided_ , that no party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(b)(ii)(A) if such partys breach of this Agreement resulted in the
application or imposition of such Law; or (B) any Governmental Entity having
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final Order or taken any other
final action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such Order or other action is or shall
have become non-appealable; provided, that the party seeking to terminate
pursuant to this Section 7.1(b)(ii)(B) shall have used its commercially
reasonable efforts to challenge such Order or other action; or

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if the Stockholder Approval shall not
have been obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof at which a vote on such approval was
taken;

(d) by the Company if:

(i) prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, (A) the board of directors of
the Company shall have determined to accept a Superior Proposal and the
Company shall have complied with Section 5.4(d)(D), (B) the board of directors
of the Company, after taking into account any modifications to the terms of
the Merger proposed by Parent and Merger Sub after receipt of the notice
contemplated by Section 5.4(d)(D), continues to believe such other proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to accept such other
proposal would result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys
stockholders under applicable law and (C) the Company shall have fully
negotiated the final terms of such Superior Proposal; or

(ii) Parent or Merger Sub shall have materially breached or failed to perform
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, such that any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
(b) are not capable of being satisfied on or before the Outside Date, and such
condition is either incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date or is
not cured on or before the Outside Date after 10 Business Days notice from the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company is not then in material
breach of this Agreement;



 

50 (e) by Parent if:

(i) the board of directors of the Company shall have (A) withdrawn, modified
or changed, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval or
recommendation by the board of directors of the Company of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, (B) approved or
recommended any Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party, or (C) entered into
any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
agreement except any confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 5.4(a) with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party; or

(ii) the Company shall have materially breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, such that any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or (b)
are not capable of being satisfied on or before the Outside Date, and such
condition is either incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date or is
not cured on or before the Outside Date after 10 Business Days notice from
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent is not then in material breach of
this Agreement.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1
(other than pursuant to Section 7.1(a)) shall give notice of such termination
to the other party in accordance with Section 8.2, specifying the provision or
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement and abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no effect without any liability on the part of any party (or its
Affiliates, directors, officers or stockholders) to the other parties hereto;
provided that, if such termination shall result from the willful failure of
the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, to
perform in all material respects any of its covenants contained in this
Agreement, such party shall be fully liable for any and all Liabilities
incurred or suffered by the other party as a result of such failure. The
provisions of this Section 7.2, Section 5.5(c) and Article VIII shall survive
any termination hereof pursuant to Section 7.1. Except as provided below, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses.

(b) The Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent an amount equal to
Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) (the "Termination Fee"),  _less_ any Parent
Expense Reimbursement previously paid pursuant to Section 7.2(c):

(i) if this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to Section
7.1(b)(i) without the Company Stockholders Meeting having been convened and
(A) following the date hereof but prior to the Outside Date, an Acquisition
Proposal by a Third Party shall have been publicly announced or disclosed to
the Company, and (B) within 12 months of such termination, the Company shall
have consummated an Alternative Transaction or entered into an agreement for
an Alternative Transaction that is subsequently consummated, concurrently
with the consummation of such Alternative Transaction;



 

51 (ii) if this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to Section
7.1(c) and (A) following the date hereof but prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced, and
(B) within 12 months of such termination, the Company shall have consummated
an Alternative Transaction or entered into an agreement for an Alternative
Transaction that is subsequently consummated, concurrently with the
consummation of such Alternative Transaction;

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.1(d)(i), concurrently with such termination;

 

(iv) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(e)(i),
within two Business Days after a demand for payment following such
termination; or

(v) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(e)(ii)
based on an intentional breach or failure by the Company and (A) following
the date hereof an Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party has been publicly
announced or disclosed to the Company and, (B) within 12 months of such
termination, the Company shall have consummated an Alternative Transaction or
entered into an agreement for an Alternative Transaction that is subsequently
consummated, concurrently with the consummation of such Alternative
Transaction.

For purposes of this Section 7.2(b), an "Alternative Transaction" means any
transaction of the type referred to in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal, provided the reference to 25% shall be deemed to be a reference to
50%.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(c), the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent up to
Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) of Parent and Merger
Subs actual and reasonably documented out-of-pocket expenses and fees
(including reasonable attorneys fees) (the "Supporting Materials") actually
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates on or prior to
the termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Parent Expense Reimbursement"), within
two Business Days of receipt of the Supporting Materials.

(d) The parties hereto agree that the Termination Fee and the Parent Expense
Reimbursement are not a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amounts would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge that in the event that either the
Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Reimbursement becomes payable and is
paid by the Company and accepted by Parent pursuant to this Section 7.2, the
Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Reimbursement, as applicable, shall be
Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under
this Agreement;  _provided_ that if the Parent Expense Reimbursement is paid
pursuant to Section 7.2(c) the Company may still be required to subsequently
pay a portion of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.2(b) in an amount
equal to the Termination Fee _less_  



 

52  the Parent Expense Reimbursement previously paid pursuant to Section 7.2(c).
If applicable, the Termination Fee shall not be payable more than
once pursuant to Section 7.2(b) and in no event shall the Company be required
to pay both the Termination Fee and the Parent Expense Reimbursement in an
aggregate amount in excess of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000).

(e) The Company acknowledges that Sections 7.2(b) and (c) are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that Parent would not
have entered into this Agreement without Sections 7.2(b) and (c); accordingly,
if the Company fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to Section
7.2(b) or (c) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit which results in a final, non-appealable judgment or ruling against the
Company for the fee set forth in Section 7.2(b) or (c), the Company shall pay
to Parent Parents reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses of enforcement) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amounts owed at the prime lending rate
prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus two
percent per annum from the date such amounts were required to be paid until
the date actually received by Parent. The Company acknowledges that it is
obligated to pay to Parent any amounts due pursuant to Section 7.2(b) whether
or not the stockholders of the Company have approved this Agreement.

parties hereto will bear all legal, accounting, investment banking and other
fees, expenses and costs incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether or not such
transactions are consummated.

 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by
Parent and by action taken by or on behalf of the respective boards of
directors of Merger Sub and the Company at any time before the Effective Time;
provided, however, that after the adoption of this Agreement and the approval
of the Merger at the Company Stockholders Meeting, no amendment shall be
made which would reduce the amount or change the kind of consideration to be
received in exchange for the Shares upon consummation of the Merger. This
Agreement may be amended only by an instrument in writing signed by each of
the parties hereto. 

Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any
party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered pursuant hereto or (c) subject to the proviso of Section 8.4, waive
compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions

extension or waiver shall be valid only against such party and only if set
forth in an instrument, in writing, signed by such party. The failure or delay
by any party hereto to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute
a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial assertion of a right
preclude any other or further assertion thereof or the exercise of any  



 

54  other right. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

Section 8.6 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors and
permitted assigns and, except as provided in Article II and Section 5.10,
nothing in this Agreement express or implied is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be
assigned by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment in violation of this
Section 8.6 shall be null and void and of no effect, provided, that Parent or
Merger Sub may assign any of their respective rights and obligations to any
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve
Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of its obligations hereunder.

Section 8.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada without regard to the
principles of conflicts of law thereof.

Section 8.8 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any Legal
Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be exclusively brought in (a) the courts of the State of Nevada
or (b) the Federal courts of the United States of America located in the State
of Nevada, and each of the parties consents to the jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Legal
Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such
Legal Proceeding in any such court or that any Legal Proceeding brought
in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any
such Legal Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting
the foregoing, each party agrees that service or process on such party as
provided in Section 8.2 shall be deemed effective service of process on such
party. Each party waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any Legal
Proceeding based on any matter arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 8.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement and that each party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including
injunction or specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach.

Section 8.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
maximum extent possible.



 

55 Section 8.11 _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of
or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 8.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile in
one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but
all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. This
Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a
counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.

Section 8.13 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule), the Voting Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all other prior
agreements and understandings both written and oral between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.



 

56 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement to be duly
executed on its behalf as of the day and year first above written.
