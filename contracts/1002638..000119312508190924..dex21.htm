ARTICLE 3

_CONVERSION OF SHARES_

Section 3.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each share of the Companys common stock, $.01 par
value per share (the " _Common Stock_ "), issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be cancelled
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into the right to receive $4.80 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ")
without any interest thereon.

(b) Each share of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of
the common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) Any shares of Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct
or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent shall, at the Effective Time,
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

(d) At the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock shall be automatically
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders immediately prior to the
Effective Time of shares of outstanding Common Stock not represented by
certificates (" _Book Entry Shares_ ") and the holders of certificates that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of outstanding
Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon
surrender of such Book Entry Shares or Certificates in accordance with
_Section 3.2_, the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, or
payment pursuant to _Section 3.3_, as applicable, for each such share of
Common Stock held by them.

(e) If at any time between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
any change in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall occur as
a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the amount of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
3.1(a)_ shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. Nothing in this
_Section 3.1(e)_ shall be construed to permit an action subject to _Section
6.1_.



 

11 Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

(a) At or prior to the Closing, Merger Sub shall deliver, in trust, to a
paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "),
for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock, Options and RSUs at
the Effective Time, sufficient funds for timely payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares,
assuming no Dissenting Shares, and the aggregate Equity Award Consideration
payable under _Section 3.4_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Consideration Fund_ "), to be paid pursuant to this _Section 3.2_. In the
event the Consideration Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration contemplated by _Section 3.1_ and the aggregate Equity Award
Consideration payable under _Section 3.4_, Merger Sub or Parent
shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, additional funds to the
Paying Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency required to make
such payments.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares whose
shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant
to _Section 3.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal that shall specify that delivery
of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have occurred,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as
applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to
the Paying Agent, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration, the form and substance of which letter of transmittal and
instructions shall be substantially as reasonably agreed to by the Company and
Parent and prepared prior to the Closing. Upon surrender of a Book-Entry
Share or a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and with such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Book-Entry Share or
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, subject to any
required withholding of Taxes, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article 3_ , and the Book-Entry Share or Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record
of Options or RSUs which are being cancelled or exchanged pursuant to
_Section 3.4_, a letter of notification notifying the holder that the Option
or RSU is being cancelled as of the Effective Time in exchange for payment of
the Equity Award Consideration, and the original Option or RSU shall have no
further force or effect. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates or the
Equity Award Consideration payable to Option holders and RSU holders under
_Section 3.4_. If any Merger Consideration or Equity Award Consideration is
to be paid to a Person other than a Person in whose name the Book-Entry Share,
Certificate, Option or RSU surrendered or cancelled in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person in whose
name the Book-Entry Share, Certificate, Option or RSU is registered shall pay
to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of payment
of the Merger Consideration or Equity Award Consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Book-Entry Share, Certificate, Option or RSU
surrendered or cancelled, or shall establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.



 

12 (c) The Consideration Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Merger Sub, Parent or the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any such investments shall be in money market mutual or similar funds
having assets in excess of $10,000,000,000. Earnings on the Consideration Fund
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Merger Sub, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and shall be paid to Merger Sub, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as Parent directs. No investment or loss of the Consideration
Fund shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent from
promptly making the payments required by this _Article 3_, and following any
losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly provide additional
funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Common
Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which additional
funds will be deemed to be part of the Consideration Fund.

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article 3_ , except
as otherwise provided by Law.

(e) Any portion of the Consideration Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of the
Company one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent.
Any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article 3_ with respect to such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim
for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Paying Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of cash from the Consideration
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any Merger
Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, and any holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share who has not theretofore complied with this 
_Article 3_ with respect thereto shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of their claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact (such affidavit shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Paying Agent) by the
Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration to which such Person is entitled in respect of such
Certificate pursuant to this _Article 3_.

Section 3.3 _Shares of Dissenting Shareholders_.



 

13 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement other than _Section 3.3(b)_ to
the contrary, any shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a shareholder who is
entitled to dissent from the Merger under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and who
has exercised, when and in the manner required by Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA
to the extent so required prior to the Effective Time, such right to dissent
and to obtain payment of the fair value of such shares under Chapter 23B.13 of
the WBCA in connection with the Merger (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until
such shareholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such shareholders right to obtain payment of the fair
value of such shareholders Dissenting Shares under Chapter 23B.13 of the
WBCA, but shall instead be entitled only to such rights with respect to such
Dissenting Shares as may be granted to such shareholder under Chapter 23B.13
of the WBCA. From and after the Effective Time, Dissenting Shares shall not be
entitled to vote for any purpose or be entitled to the payment of dividends or
other distributions (except dividends or other distributions payable to
shareholders of record prior to the Effective Time). The Company shall
promptly provide any notices of dissent to Parent.

(b) If any shareholder who holds Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or
loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such shareholders right to
obtain payment of the fair value of such shareholders Dissenting Shares
under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA, then, as of the later of the Effective Time
and the occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss, such shareholders
shares of Common Stock shall no longer be Dissenting Shares and, if the
occurrence of such effective withdrawal or loss is later than the Effective
Time, shall be treated as if they had as of the Effective Time been converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration as set forth in subsection (a)
of _Section 3.1_. 

Section 3.4 _Treatment of Stock Awards_.

(a) _Company Options_. Each option to purchase Common Stock (whether vested or
unvested) (an " _Option_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (whether under the Company Equity Plans or pursuant to an individual
stock option agreement) shall be cancelled and the holder of such Option (if
the Merger Consideration is greater than the exercise price per share of the
Common Stock of such Option) will, in full settlement of such Option, be
entitled to receive from Merger Sub an amount, in cash (the "Option
Consideration") equal to: (i) the Merger Consideration less the exercise price
per share of such Option if the amount is positive; or (ii) zero dollars, if
the value of the Merger Consideration minus the exercise price per share of
the Common Stock is negative. The term "Aggregate Option Consideration" shall
mean the sum of the Option Consideration of each Option. The
Option Consideration may be subject to withholding of Taxes.

(b) _Restricted Stock Units_. Each restricted stock unit and
restricted deferred stock unit providing for the issuance of Common Stock
(whether vested or unvested and whether under the Company Equity Plans, the
deferred compensation plans listed on _Section 4.9(j) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_, or pursuant to an individual agreement) (an " _RSU_ ")
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and the
holder of such RSU will, in full settlement of such RSU, be entitled to
receive from Merger Sub an amount, subject to any required withholding of
Taxes, in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration  



 

14  multiplied by (ii) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock subject to
such RSU (such product, the " _RSU Consideration_ ").

severance, termination pay, change in control or retention related Benefit
Plans or arrangements.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 4.9(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, the Company has delivered to the Parent correct and complete
copies of each Benefit Plan (as currently in effect), and with respect to each
such Benefit Plan (if applicable thereto) (i) any associated trust, custodial,

recent annual report, actuarial report, or summary plan description submitted
to any Governmental Entity or distributed to participants or beneficiaries
thereunder, and (iii) the most recently received IRS determination letter and
any governmental advisory opinions, rulings, compliance statements, closing
agreements, or similar materials specific to such Benefit Plan. Except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, all such communications, reports, or
disclosures at the time made, accurately reflected the terms and operations of
the Benefit Plan.

(c) Each Benefit Plan is and has heretofore been maintained and operated in
material compliance with the terms of such Benefit Plan and with
all requirements of applicable  



 

22  Law, except for such noncompliance as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no event has occurred and no
condition exists with respect to any Benefit Plan that would subject the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation, or Parent, either
directly or by reason of its affiliation with the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate, to any excise tax, fine, lien or penalty imposed by ERISA, the Code
or other applicable Laws. Each Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code is the subject of an unrevoked favorable
determination letter from the IRS. To the knowledge of the Company, nothing
has occurred to each such Benefit Plan that has resulted or is likely
to result in the revocation of such determination as to such Benefit Plan.

(d) No Benefit Plan is or, at any time during the last six (6) years, was (i)
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (ii) a multiple
employer plan, multiple employer welfare arrangement, voluntary employees
beneficiary association or a multiemployer plan within the meaning of ERISA
and the Code, (iii) required by its terms to provide employee welfare benefits
(within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA), including health and life
insurance, to current or future retired or terminated employees, independent
contractors, directors, or their spouses or dependents (other than in
accordance with applicable Law, including, without limitation, Section 4980B
of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA), (iv) funded through
a "welfare benefit fund", as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the
Code, or (v) a nonconforming group health plan (as defined in Section 5000(c)
of the Code).

(e) There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened legal
action, proceeding, or investigation, other than routine claims for benefits,
concerning any Benefit Plan, or to the best of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries knowledge, any fiduciary or service provider thereof in
connection therewith, which, if decided adversely to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries have not undertaken to maintain
any Benefit Plan for any period of time and each such Benefit Plan is
terminable at the sole discretion of the Company (or its successor), subject
only to such constraints as may be imposed by applicable Law or the specific
terms of such Benefit Plan. The Company and its Subsidiaries have not
announced their intention to adopt any arrangement or program which, once
established, would come within the definition of a Benefit Plan or undertaken
(whether or not legally bound) to modify or terminate any such plan (except
to the extent necessary to comply with applicable Law or to cause a Benefit
Plan to reflect applicable Law).

(g) Except as set forth on _Section 4.9(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, the execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the
consummation of the contemplated transactions (whether alone or in conjunction
with any other event) will not (i) require the Company, any ERISA Affiliate,
the Surviving Corporation, the Parent, or any Benefit Plan to pay greater
compensation or make a larger contribution to, or pay greater benefits or
accelerate payment or vesting of a benefit under, any Benefit Plan, (ii)
create or give rise to any additional vested rights or service credits, or
require any benefit to be funded or annuitized, under any Benefit Plan, (iii)
result in any forfeiture, reduction or diminution of all or a portion of the
 



 

23  accrued benefits or account balance of any participant in a Benefit Plan,
(iv) result in any payment (including severance, unemployment
compensation, golden parachute, change of control, retention, bonus or
otherwise) becoming due to any current or former director, officer or employee
of, or consultant to, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or (v) result in
any increase or acceleration of contributions, liabilities or benefits, or
acceleration of vesting, under any Benefit Plan or restriction imposed on any
asset held in connection with a Benefit Plan or otherwise.

(h) No employer securities, employer real property or other employer property
is included in the assets of any Benefit Plan.

(i) Full payment has been made of all amounts which the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate was required under the terms of the Benefit Plans to have paid
as contributions (including all employer contributions and employee salary
reduction contributions), premium payments or other payments to such Benefit
Plans within the time period prescribed by ERISA and all such contributions
for any period ending on or before the Effective Time which are not yet due
have been made to each such Benefit Plan or included in the consolidated
balance sheets of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries included in
the Company SEC Reports (or, if the Subsidiary maintaining, contributing to
or bound by the Benefit Plan is not a consolidated Subsidiary, on the books of
the relevant Subsidiary.)

(j) Except as provided in _Section 4.9(j) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is not a party to any
arrangement, oral or written, (i) the amounts payable from which would fail to
be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G or
Section 162(m) of the Code, or (ii) that would provide a gross-up to any
employee or independent contractor for the cost of taxes or penalties imposed
on such person. With respect to any nonqualified deferred compensation plan
listed on _Section 4.9(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, (a) no such
plan has assets set aside directly or indirectly in the manner described in
Section 409A(b)(1) of the Code or contains a provision that would be subject
to Section 409A(b)(2) of the Code, and (b) the Company has complied in good
faith with all requirements of Section 409A of the Code, to the extent
applicable thereto.

(k) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each Benefit Plan mandated by
a foreign (i.e., non-United States) Governmental Entity or subject to the
Laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States that is intended to
qualify for special tax treatment meets all of the requirements for such
treatment and has obtained all necessary approvals of all relevant
Governmental Entities.

(l) No equity awards, other than the Options and RSUs listed on  _Section
4.9(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ are currently outstanding, whether
under the Company Equity Plans, under other equity plans sponsored by the
Company, or pursuant to individual grants.

(m) Except as set forth on _Section 4.9(m) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, since June 30, 2008, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has granted any increase in the compensation (in any form)
of its directors, officers or employees, entered into any new employment or
severance protection agreement with any such director, officer or  



 

24  employee, or increased any benefits payable under its current severance,
change of control or termination pay policies, except in the ordinary course
of business, consistent with past practice.

(i) there is no pending Legal Proceeding, and to the knowledge of the Company
no Person has threatened to commence any Legal Proceeding that involves the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of the material assets owned or
used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (ii) to the knowledge of
the Company, no event has occurred and there has been no communication that
will, or that would reasonably be expected to, give rise to or serve as a
basis for the commencement of any material Legal Proceeding.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of the material assets owned or
used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is subject.

Section 4.11 _Compliance with Law_. Except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of, or
in default under, any Law, in each case, applicable to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets and properties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 4.11_ shall not apply to Benefit
Plans, Taxes, Environmental Laws or labor matters, which are the subject
exclusively of the representations and warranties in _Section 4.9_, _Section
4.13_, _Section 4.15_ and _Section 4.16_, respectively.

(a) _Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth all (i)
issued patents and pending patent applications and Company Patents existing as

slogans, tag lines and uniform resource locators, Internet domain names, and
Internet domain name applications, and (iii) copyright registrations and
applications for registration thereof, and material unregistered copyrights
in each case that are owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Other
than Intellectual Property that is licensed from third parties and identified
as such in _Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, the Company
or a Company Subsidiary owns all right, title and interest in and to the
Intellectual Property used or currently under development for future use in
the business of the Company free and clear of all Encumbrances and there is
no other Intellectual Property used or currently under development for future
use in the business of the Company that is not owned by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary and set forth in _Section 4.12(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_. The registrations and applications in the Company
Patents set out in _Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_
comprise all of the related and counterpart registrations and applications to
the Company Patents that are in existence as of the Effective Time. To the
knowledge of the Company, there exist no other patents, patent applications,
registrations, reissues, divisions, continuations, continuations-in-part,
revisions, re-examinations or extensions, anywhere in the  



 

25  world, that take priority, directly or indirectly, from any of the Company
Patents or part thereof. With respect to each item of Intellectual Property
used or currently under development for future use in the business of the
Company, including those items required to be identified in _Section 4.12(a)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, (i) except for items which are licensed
from third parties or in the public domain, as specifically identified in
_Section 4.12(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, the Company or one
of its Subsidiaries own all right, title, and interest in and to such item,
free and clear of any lien other than Permitted Liens; (ii) except for office
actions identified and described in _Section 4.12(a)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_ and disclosed to Parent, such item is not subject to any
outstanding injunction, judgment, order, finding of full or partial
invalidity or unenforceability or any other adverse ruling or determination of
any Governmental Entity which the Company has received written notice and to
the knowledge of Company, there exists no basis for any of the foregoing in
the future; (iii) no lawsuit of which the Company has received written notice
is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, is threatened that challenges
the validity or enforceability of such item in whole or in part and (iv) any
registration or application regarding the Intellectual Property owned by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary in existence as of the Effective Time, has
been maintained with the applicable government authorities and is
still listed with such authorities as subsisting in good standing and as
being in full force and effect and in the name of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary and excluding applications and registrations that have been
abandoned or withdrawn in the reasonable business judgment of the Company or
a Company Subsidiary as set forth in _Section 4.12(a)(iv) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_, no such existing application or registration for a
patent has been rejected, suspended or subject to an office action or similar
act by the applicable government authority.

(b) _Section 4.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a list
of all material agreements under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Intellectual Property that is used by the Company or such Subsidiary in the
conduct of its business, as presently conducted, except for off-the-shelf
software programs and other readily available commercial software that the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries use in the ordinary course of business
(such agreements being referred to as " _License-In Agreements_ "). Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material default of any such
License-In Agreement, and no event has occurred that constitutes a material
default thereunder, except for any of the foregoing that have not had, and
are not reasonably expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of the Company each License-In Agreement is valid, binding, and in
full force and effect.

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse effect, the Company and
its Subsidiaries own or have the right to use, without payments to any other
Person other than payments described in any agreement disclosed to the Parent,
all Intellectual Property used in the operation of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as and where the business is presently conducted. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable actions
required to maintain the validity and enforceability of each item of
Intellectual Property that they own or use, except where the failure to take
such actions would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.



 

26 (d) To the knowledge of the Company, the operation of the business of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as and where presently conducted does not
infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property rights of third parties,
including, without limitation those patents listed on _Section 4.12(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_ and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notice alleging any such infringement or
misappropriation (including any written claim that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property
rights of any third party), except as identified in _Section 4.12(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_. To the knowledge of the Company, no third party

Schedule_, to the knowledge of the Company, as of the Effective Time, no

officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will have, directly or
indirectly, any material interest in any material Intellectual Property used
or under development and to be used in the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 4.12(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has entered into

Disclosure Schedule_: (i) all copies of any software forming a part of the
Technology, and to the knowledge of the Company, all copies of any software
forming a part of the Technology, have been distributed solely in object code
with an indication of the name of the Company or applicable Subsidiary; (ii)
each copy of the Technology and, to the knowledge of the Company, each copy
of the Technology provided by the Company or applicable Subsidiary to any
third party (including end users or resellers) was provided under a license
agreement or reseller agreement and to the extent that such third parties
continue to be in possession of the applicable Technology, they continue to
be bound under their applicable obligations under such licenses or agreements.
Except pursuant to Contracts disclosed in this Agreement or as disclosed in
_Section 4.12(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, to the knowledge of
the Company, material portions of the source code for the Technology have not
been delivered or made available to any Person, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary have agreed to or undertaken to or in any way promised to
provide such source code to any third Person, and such source code is
currently stored on the premises of the Company or a Company Subsidiary.

(g) To the knowledge of the Company, the Technology functions materially in
accordance with the applicable specifications and documentation therefore. All
material source code for the Technology is written entirely in the
programming environments specified in _Section 4.12(g) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_, and is reasonably sufficiently documented in the source
code to enable a software developer reasonably skilled in such environments
to understand and compile using commercially available software and to
provide technical support for the Technology upon completion of a training
course of the Company.



 

27 (h) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 4.12(h) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_, to the knowledge of the Company, no software that is
material Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and included in the Technology contains, or is derived from, or is distributed
with any open source software that is licensed under any terms that impose a
requirement that such Intellectual Property owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries (i) be disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii) be
licensed for the purpose of making modifications or derivative works; or
(iii) be redistributable at no charge.

(i) Except as specified in _Section 4.12(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, the Technology, to the knowledge of the Company, does not contain
any encryption, enciphering or other similar technology or perform any
encryption function without the use of other third party software which is not
part of, bundled with or included in the Technology.

(j) Except as specified in _Section 4.12(j) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, the Technology, to the knowledge of the Company, does not contain
any disabling mechanism or protection feature designed to prevent its use or
computer virus, worm, software lock, drop dead device, Trojan-horse routine,
trap door, time bomb or any other codes or instructions that may be used to
access, modify, delete, damage or disable any portion of such Technology or
any computer system on which any of such Technology is installed or in
connection with which such Technology may operate. 

Section 4.13 _Taxes_.

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 4.13(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, the Company and each material Company Subsidiary have timely filed
all Tax Returns that they were required to file under applicable Laws. All
such Tax Returns were correct and complete and have been prepared in material
compliance with all applicable Laws. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which

jurisdiction where the Company and each Company Subsidiary does not file Tax
Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 4.13(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, all Taxes due and owing by the Company and each material Company
Subsidiary on or before the date hereof (whether or not shown on any Tax
Return) have been paid. The Company Unaudited Balance Sheet reflects an
adequate reserve under GAAP for Taxes payable by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof ending on the date
of the Company Unaudited Balance Sheet. Since the date of the Company
Unaudited Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any material Company
Subsidiary has incurred any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course
of business or otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice.

all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with any
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,

(e) Except as set forth in _Section 4.13(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received from
any Governmental Entity any (i) notice indicating an intent to open an audit
or other review related to Tax matters, (ii) request for information related
to Tax matters, or (iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment with
respect to Taxes of the Company and each Company Subsidiary. No proceedings
are pending or being conducted with respect to any Tax matter and no power of
attorney (other than powers of attorney authorizing employees of the Company
to act on behalf of the Company) with respect to any Taxes of the Company or

case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for such violations, breaches or
defaults that, or filings, registrations, notifications, authorizations,

Guarantor, threatened, that would, individually or in the aggregate,

the payment of the Merger Consideration, the repayment or refinancing of any
existing indebtedness and all related fees and expenses, none of the Surviving

Superior Proposal and that the evaluation of such Acquisition Proposal is
reasonably required by the boards fiduciary duties to the Companys
shareholders under applicable Law, the Company may, in response to such
Acquisition Proposal (provided such Acquisition Proposal did not result from
a breach by it of _Section 6.4(a)_, _Section 6.4(b)_ or _Section 6.4(c)_),
(A) furnish information with respect to it and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (as determined after consultation with its outside
counsel), the benefits of the terms of which cannot be more favorable to the
other party to such confidentiality agreement than those in place with Parent
(" _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and (B) participate in
discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal; provided
that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty four hours)
provide to the Parent a copy of the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and
all other information provided to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
(unless such information has already been provided to Parent). From and after
the date hereof, if the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
it shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of such Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry, the identity of the Person who made such Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry, any request for information, and the material terms and
conditions of such request, inquiry, or Acquisition Proposal, and shall keep
Parent promptly and reasonably informed of the status and details of any
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

(c) The Company agrees that, except as provided below with respect to a
Superior Proposal, the Companys board of directors shall recommend that the
holders of Common Stock vote to approve the Agreement and the Merger ("
_Company Recommendation_ ").  



 

39  Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.4(c)_, neither the board
of directors of the Company, nor any committee thereof (including the Special
Committee) shall cause, permit or take, or permit any Company Representative,
Subsidiary or Subsidiary Representative to permit or take, any action which
would be a Change of Recommendation. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Change
of Recommendation_ " shall mean any of the following: (i) withholding,
withdrawal, qualification or modification of (or any proposal or resolution to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify) the Company Recommendation in any
manner that would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or materially
impair the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, or failure of Company to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; (ii) the Companys board of directors
taking of a neutral position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that has
been publicly disclosed or otherwise become broadly known to Persons other
than the Company, Parent, the party making the Acquisition Proposal, and
their respective Representatives after a reasonable amount of time has elapsed
for the Companys board of directors to review and make a recommendation with
respect thereto (and in no event more than ten Business Days after
being publicly disclosed or otherwise become broadly known to Persons other
than the Company, Parent, the party making the Acquisition Proposal, and their
respective Representatives), provided that for purposes of this _Section
6.4(c)(ii)_ the Companys acknowledgement of receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal and that the Company is reviewing such Acquisition Proposal shall not
constitute a Change of Recommendation only if the board of directors of the
Company therein expressly publicly reaffirms its approval and recommendation
of this Agreement and the Merger; (iii) failure of the Companys board of
directors to (A) if a tender offer, take-over bid or exchange offer that
constitutes or would constitute an Acquisition Proposal (other than by
Parent) is commenced, recommend that the Company shareholders not accept such
tender offer, take-over bid or exchange offer after a reasonable amount of
time has elapsed for the Companys board of directors to review and make a
recommendation with respect thereto (and in no event more than ten Business
Days following commencement of such tender offer, take-over bid or exchange
offer), or (B) reaffirm in writing the Company Recommendation in connection
with a disclosure pursuant to _Section 6.4(d)_ or otherwise within two
Business Days of a request by Parent to do so; or (iv) approval, adoption or
recommendation, or publicly disclosed proposal to approve, adopt
or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior
to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys shareholders at the Company
Shareholders Meeting, in response to the receipt of a written Acquisition
Proposal in connection with which the Company has not breached _Section
6.4(a)_ (subject to _Section 6.4(b)_), if the board of directors of the
Company determines that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, then
the board of directors of the Company may approve or recommend such Superior
Proposal and, in connection with the approval or recommendation of such
Superior Proposal, make a Change of Recommendation (and subject to Article 8,
cause the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement or understanding (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ ") with respect to such Superior Proposal); provided
that (x) the Company notifies Parent in writing that it intends to effect a
Change of Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal, with such
notice specifying any material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Agreement and identifying the party making the Superior Proposal, (y)
thereafter Parent is provided five (5) Business Days to negotiate, but is
under no obligation with respect thereto, with the Company for amendment of
this Agreement prior to making the Change of Recommendation, and (z)
following such negotiation, the Companys board of directors



 

40 determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior
Proposal.

(d) Nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall prohibit the board of directors of
the Company from taking and disclosing to the Companys shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or other applicable law, if the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that failure to so disclose such position could constitute a violation of
applicable law and any such disclosure which would otherwise constitute a
withdrawal, change or modification of the approval or recommendation of the
board of directors of the Company, shall not be deemed to constitute such a
withdrawal, change or modification with respect to the Merger for the purposes
of _Section 6.4(c)_ only if the board of directors of the Company expressly
publicly reaffirms its approval and recommendation of this Agreement and the
Merger within two (2) Business Days after a request by Parent to do so. In
addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Section 6.4,
a factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the
Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto and contains a "stop look and
listen" communication shall not constitute a withdrawal, change or
modification of the approval or recommendation of the board of directors of
the Company with respect to the Merger for the purposes of Section 6.4(c) only
if the board of directors of the Company expressly publicly reaffirms in such
communication its approval and recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger

Section 6.5 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall honor or cause to be honored, in
accordance with their terms, the employment termination, severance and other
retention agreements listed in _Section 4.9(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_, in each case existing immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement, that are between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
current or former officer, director or employee thereof or for the benefit of
any such current or former officer, director or employee.

(b) Parent shall treat, and shall cause each benefit plan, program, practice,
policy and arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) or Affiliates following the Effective Time and in
which any of the employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries (the "
_Employees_ ") participate or are eligible to participate (the " _Parent
Plans_ ") to treat, for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
vesting, accrual of and entitlement to benefits (but not for accrual of
benefits under any "defined benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(35) of
ERISA) and all other purposes, all service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company or any
Benefit Plan provides past service credit) as service with Parent and its
Subsidiaries. Parent shall cause each Parent Plan that is a welfare benefit
plan, within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, (i) to waive any and all
eligibility waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements and pre-
existing condition limitations to the extent waived, satisfied or not included
under the corresponding Benefit Plan, and (ii) to recognize for each Employee
for purposes of applying annual deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket
maximums under such Parent Plan any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by the Employee and his or her spouse and dependents under a  



 

41  corresponding Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which occurs the
later of the Effective Time and the date on which the Employee begins
participation in such Parent Plan.

Section 6.6 _Publicity_. The initial press release by each of Parent and the
Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be acceptable
to Parent and the Company. Neither the Company nor Parent (nor any of their
respective Affiliates) shall issue any other press release or make any other
public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior agreement of the other party, except as
may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a national securities
exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or
make such public announcement shall use its reasonable efforts to consult in
good faith with the other party before making any such public announcements;
provided that the Company will no longer be required to obtain the prior
agreement of or consult with Parent in connection with any such press release
or public announcement if the Companys board of directors has effected a
Change of Recommendation or in connection with any such press release or
public announcement pursuant to _Section 6.4(d)_.

Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Insurance and Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the seventh (7th) anniversary
thereof, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify
and hold harmless the individuals who immediately prior to the Effective Time
were directors or officers of the Company or any of its present or former
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities in connection with claims or actions arising out of
the fact that the Indemnified Parties were officers or directors of the
Company, at least to the extent provided for by the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, promptly advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted by Law; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is determined that such
person is not entitled to indemnification. The articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect
to indemnification and advancement of expenses no less favorable than those
set forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as
amended, restated and in effect on the date of this Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of seven (7) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification is required by Law.

(b) Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time customary policies of directors and officers
liability insurance that contain coverage no less favorable than the coverage
maintained by the Company for the Indemnified Parties prior to the Effective
Time with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). In lieu of the
purchase of such insurance by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the Company
may prior to the Effective Time, subject to obtaining prior written approval
from Parent, purchase a six year run-off program for directors and
officers liability insurance providing at least the same coverage with
respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.



 

42 (c) This _Section 6.7_ is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties, and
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation.

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors, assigns and transferees of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their respective successors or assigns, as the case may
be, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

Section 6.8 _Proxy Statement_. Except upon a Change of Recommendation, (a)
the Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law
and its articles of incorporation and bylaws and Nasdaq rules to call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Companys shareholders
(including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _Company
Shareholders Meeting_ ") as soon as is reasonably practicable for the purpose
of approving this Agreement and the Merger, and (b) in connection with the
Company Shareholders Meeting, as soon as is reasonably practicable the
Company, in cooperation with Parent, shall prepare and file with the SEC a
proxy statement (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this Agreement, solicit the
shareholders approval of the Agreement and Merger, and furnish the
information required to be provided to the shareholders of the Company
pursuant to the WBCA and the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that, if upon the
date initially fixed for the Company Shareholders Meeting, the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ have not been met, the Company may reschedule or
adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting to such later date as the Company,
in its reasonable discretion, considers to be more proximate to the probable
satisfaction of such conditions; and provided further, that upon Parents
reasonable request, the Company shall postpone the Company Shareholders
Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional shareholder proxies to be
voted at the Company Shareholder Meeting. Promptly after its preparation and
prior to its filing with the SEC, the Company shall provide a copy of
the Proxy Statement, and any amendment to the Proxy Statement and related SEC
or Nasdaq filings, to Parent, and Parent and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and
related materials, and any proposed amendment or supplement thereto, prior to
filing, and the Company shall in good faith consider such comments for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement and/or related materials. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any comments on the Proxy Statement received by
the SEC, and the Company, in consultation with Parent, shall promptly respond
to SEC comments, if any. So long as the Companys board of directors shall not
have effected a Change of Recommendation, the Proxy Statement shall include
the recommendation of the Companys board of directors that the Companys
shareholders approve this Agreement.

Section 6.9 _Resignation of Directors_. The Company shall use, and shall cause
the Company Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to assist in
effecting the resignations of the directors of the Company and
Company Subsidiaries effective on the Effective Time.

Section 6.10 _Best Efforts_.



 

43 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
the Company and Parent shall each use their best efforts to promptly (i)
take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done,
and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any actions, non-actions,
clearances, waivers, consents, approvals, permits or orders required to be
obtained by the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii)
promptly make all necessary registrations and filings, and thereafter make any
other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger
required under (A) any applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B)
the HSR Act and any applicable competition, antitrust or investment Laws of
jurisdictions other than the United States, and (C) any other applicable Law;
provided, however, that the Company and Parent will cooperate with each other
in connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies
of all such filings and attachments to outside counsel for the non-filing
party; (iv) furnish all information required for any application or other
filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (v) keep the other party informed
in all material respects of any material communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Entity and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (vi) permit the other parties to review any material communication
delivered to, and consult with the other party in advance of any meeting or
conference with, any Governmental Entity relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with any proceeding by a
private party relating thereto, and giving the other party the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences; (vii) avoid the entry
of, or have vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including defending any lawsuits or
other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; and
(viii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; in each instance set forth in
(i)(viii) above to the extent permitted by Law. No parties to this Agreement
shall consent to any voluntary delay of the Closing at the behest of any
Governmental Entity without the consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In addition, the
Company shall use its best efforts to promptly obtain all consents
or approvals required by virtue of the execution hereof by the Company or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated herein by the Company to
avoid the violation or breach of, or the default under, any third-party
agreement, contract or any other instrument to which the Company is a party
or to which it or any of its properties or assets are subject; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to agree to any term or
provision in any such consent or approval required hereby not conditioned on
the Closing occurring; _provided_ , _further_ , with respect to the foregoing,
Parent and Merger Sub shall be permitted to work with the Company and
facilitate the Companys efforts to obtain such consents, and the Company
shall provide to Parent timely updates as to the status of consents and Parent
shall be entitled to review and approve any proposed consent, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld.



 

44 (b) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other, shall give prompt notice to the other of any written notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger.

(other than those representations and warranties that address matters only as

representations and warranties need only be true and accurate as of such date
or with respect to such period), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and accurate (without
giving effect to any limitation relating to materiality or Company Material
Adverse Effect set forth therein) would not, individually or in the aggregate,

condition, circumstance, development or effect giving rise to such
Company Material Adverse Effect has been fully remedied, such that no
remaining impact therefrom is present, all as determined by Parent in good
faith.

(e) The Rights Agreement shall have been terminated or, if not terminated,

7.1_, _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if
such failure was caused by such partys failure to act in good faith or use
its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the other

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

(i) if the Merger shall not have occurred on or prior to January 1, 2009
(the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided, however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be

Recommendation or approved or recommended, or proposed publicly to approve or

would not be satisfied (assuming that the date of such determination is the
Closing Date); _provided_ that if such breach is curable by the Company
through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts and the Company continues
to exercise such reasonable best efforts, Parent may not terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_; _provided further_ that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ shall not
be available to Parent if it or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform
any of its representations and warranties or obligations under or in
connection with this Agreement that would result in any closing condition set
forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_ not being satisfied; or

pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, or by Parent

deemed to have been received upon, the later of the date specified in such

such rejection, refusal or inability to deliver. Nothing in this section
shall be deemed to constitute consent to the manner or address for service of
process in connection with any legal proceeding, including litigation arising
out of or in connection with this Agreement.

Section 9.4 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provisions of this Agreement. Information provided in any section of the

disclosure of such facts or circumstances with respect to any section of 
_Article 4_ calling for disclosure of such information, whether or not such
disclosure is specifically associated with or purports to respond to one or
more or all of such representations or warranties, only so long as it is
reasonably clear from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to such other representation and warranty. The inclusion of any
item in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to be an admission
or evidence of materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard
of materiality for any purpose whatsoever.

Section 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be
an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Company Disclosure Schedule and the exhibits and instruments
referred to herein) and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the
entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements  



 

51  and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, (i)
communications in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the
other agreements contemplated herein, and (ii) prior written drafts of this
Agreement) and (b) except for (i) the provisions set forth in  _Section 6.7_
of this Agreement, (ii) the right of the Companys shareholders to receive the
Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, and (iii) the right of the holders
of Options or RSUs to receive the Option Consideration or RSU Consideration,
as applicable, at the Effective Time are not intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder;
_provided_ that the Company shall be entitled to pursue and recover damages
suffered by its shareholders, to the full extent as if such shareholders were
parties hereto, in the event of Parent or Merger Subs breach of this
Agreement or fraud. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the parties
intent that no term contained in or omitted from any prior written draft of
this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein be used as extrinsic
evidence under any state law or judicial interpretation to determine the
intent of the parties. 

Section 9.7 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way
be affected, impaired or invalidated.

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Washington applicable to contracts
to be made and performed entirely therein without giving effect to the
principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

Section 9.9 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) expressly
and irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any United
States federal court located in the State of Illinois or any Illinois state
court in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any court other than a United States federal or state
court sitting in the State of Illinois; _provided_ that each of the parties
shall have the right to bring any action or proceeding for enforcement of a
judgment entered by any United States federal court located in the State of
Illinois or any Illinois state court in any other court or jurisdiction.

service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred
to in _Section 9.9_ in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies
thereof by registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 9.3_.
However, the foregoing shall not limit the right of a party to effect service
of process on the other party by any other legally available method.

Section 9.11 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
and agrees that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement, each
nonbreaching party would be  



 

52  irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary
damages. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto (a) will waive,
in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy
at law and (b) shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which
they may be entitled at law or in equity, to compel specific performance of
this Agreement in any action instituted in accordance with _Section 9.9_
without bond or other security being required.

Section 9.12  _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties; provided that Merger Sub may assign this
Agreement to another wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns. Any purported assignment hereof not in compliance with
this _Section 9.12_ shall be null and void.

Section 9.13 _Expenses_. Except as provided in Section 8.2(b) above, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Merger or any

Section 9.14 _Currency_. All payments hereunder or contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid in United States currency.

Agreement and the table of contents, schedules and exhibits are for
convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or
interpretative effect whatsoever.

Section 9.16 _Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party or parties entitled
to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent
or other failure.

Section 9.17 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB, THE GUARANTOR
AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF
PARENT, MERGER SUB, THE GUARANTOR OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

Section 9.18 _Guarantee_.

(a)  _Guarantee_. The Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to the Company the full, complete and timely compliance with and
performance of all agreements, covenants and obligations of Parent, Merger Sub

53  take any and all action necessary to cause Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Corporation to perform the Buyer Obligations (collectively, the "

set-off or deduction and, shall remain in full force and effect without regard
to, and shall not be released, impaired or discharged by any circumstance or

readjustment, composition, liquidation or similar proceeding with respect to
Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation or their respective
properties or their creditors or any action taken by any trustee or receiver
