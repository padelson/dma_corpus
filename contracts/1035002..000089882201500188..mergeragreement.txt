                                   ARTICLE III

                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

     3.1 Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any capital
stock of UDS:

     (a) All shares of capital stock of UDS that are held by UDS as treasury
stock or that are owned by Valero or any wholly-owned subsidiaries of UDS or
Valero immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and
shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist.

     (b) Subject to Sections 3.1(a), 3.1(c), 3.1(d), 3.1(e) and 3.7, each
outstanding share of UDS Common Stock (together with any associated UDS Rights)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive, at the option of the holder as contemplated
by Sections 3.1(f) through 3.1(j), either (i) a number of shares of Valero
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the "Stock Consideration") or (ii) an
amount in cash equal to the sum of (said formula being referred to herein as the
"Cash Consideration Formula") (x) $27.50 and (y) the product of (I) 0.614 and
(II) the Valero Average Closing Price (the "Cash Consideration" and together
with the Stock Consideration and the shares of Valero Common Stock issued
pursuant to Section 3.1(d), the "Merger Consideration"). All of the shares of
Valero Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration shall be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. One
preferred share purchase right issuable pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated
as of July 17, 1997, between Valero and Computershare Investor Services, LLC, as
successor rights agent to Harris Trust and Savings Bank (the "Valero Rights
Agreement"), or any other purchase right issued in substitution thereof (the
"Valero Rights"), shall be issued together with and shall attach to each share
of Valero Common Stock issued pursuant to this Section 3.1(b) and Section
3.1(d), subject and pursuant to the terms of the Valero Rights Agreement. All
shares of UDS Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.1(b) and Section 3.1(d) shall cease to
be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of UDS Common Stock (a "UDS Certificate") shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of UDS Common
Stock, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be issued in
consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which holders
of UDS Common Stock become entitled all in accordance with this Article III upon
the surrender of such UDS Certificate.

     (c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is
a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, stock dividend,
combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect
of, UDS Common Stock or Valero Common Stock, each of the Exchange Ratio and the
Cash Consideration Formula shall be adjusted accordingly, without duplication,
to provide to the holders of UDS Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.



                                      -13-

<PAGE>


     (d) Subject to Section 3.7, each share held as of the Effective Time in the
Employee Grantor Trust pursuant to the UDS Grantor Trust Stock Ownership Program
("GSOP"), each share of UDS Restricted Stock and each share of UDS Common Stock
that is owned by any UDS Benefit Plan shall be converted into the right to
receive a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Valero Common Stock
equal to the Exchange Ratio.

     (e) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, no
shares of UDS Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective
Time and that are held by a stockholder who has properly exercised such
stockholder's appraisal rights (any such shares being referred to herein as
"Dissenting Shares") under the DGCL shall be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1(b) unless and until such
stockholder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost, such stockholder's right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL and to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such
Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. If
any such stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right prior to the Election Deadline, each of such
holder's shares of UDS Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to be Non-Election
Shares for all purposes of this Article III. If any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall have so failed to perfect or has effectively withdrawn or lost such
stockholder's right to dissent from the Merger after the Election Deadline, each
of such holder's shares of UDS Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Stock Consideration or the Cash Consideration, or a combination
thereof, as determined by Valero in its sole discretion.

     (f) Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.1, each record holder of
shares of UDS Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
to be converted in the Merger pursuant to Section 3.1(b) will be entitled to
elect to receive either (i) the Cash Consideration for all of such holder's
shares ("Cash Election"), (ii) the Cash Consideration for a stated number of
such holder's shares and a number of shares of Valero Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio per share of UDS Common Stock for the balance of such holder's
shares of UDS Common Stock ("Partial Cash Election") or (iii) a number of shares
of Valero Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio per share of UDS Common Stock
for all of such holder's shares of UDS Common Stock ("Stock Election"). All Cash
Elections, Partial Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall be unconditional and
made on a form designed for that purpose and mutually agreeable to Valero and
UDS (a "Form of Election"). Any holder of UDS Common Stock who fails to properly
make a Cash Election, Partial Cash Election or Stock Election and any holder who
fails to submit to the Exchange Agent a properly completed and signed and
properly and timely submitted Form of Election shall be deemed to have indicated
no preference as to the receipt of cash or Valero Common Stock with respect to
such holder's shares (a "Non-Election") and will receive for such UDS Common
Stock the Merger Consideration described in Section 3.1(g), 3.1(h) or 3.1(i), as
applicable. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein, the aggregate
number of shares of UDS Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive
cash in the Merger (which shall for this purpose be deemed to include Dissenting
Shares, if any) shall be equal to the Cash Election Number.

     (g) If the aggregate number of shares of UDS Common Stock for which cash is
elected under a Cash Election or a Partial Cash Election and Dissenting Shares,
if any



                                      -14-

<PAGE>


(collectively, the "Cash Election Shares"), exceeds the Cash Election
Number, then all shares of UDS Common Stock for which Valero Common Stock was
elected under a Stock Election or Partial Cash Election (collectively, the
"Stock Election Shares") and all shares of UDS Common Stock covered by
Non-Elections (the "Non-Election Shares") shall be converted into the right to
receive Valero Common Stock, and the Cash Election Shares (other than Dissenting
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive cash and Valero Common
Stock in the following manner:

                  Each Cash Election Share (other than Dissenting Shares) shall
            be converted into the right to receive (A) an amount of cash
            (rounded to the nearest cent), without interest, equal to the
            product of (x) the Cash Consideration and (y) a fraction (the "Cash
            Fraction"), the numerator of which shall be the Cash Election Number
            and the denominator of which shall be the total number of Cash
            Election Shares and (B) a number of shares of Valero Common Stock
            equal to the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction
            equal to one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

     (h) If the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares exceeds the Stock
Election Number, all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive cash, and all Stock Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive Valero Common Stock and cash in the
following manner:

                  Each Stock Election Share shall be converted into the right to
            receive (A) a number of shares of Valero Common Stock equal to the
            product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction (the "Stock
            Fraction"), the numerator of which shall be the Stock Election
            Number and the denominator of which shall be the total number of
            Stock Election Shares, and (B) an amount of cash (rounded to the
            nearest cent), without interest, equal to the product of (x) the
            Cash Consideration and (y) a fraction equal to one (1) minus the
            Stock Fraction.

     (i) In the event that neither Section 3.1(g) or 3.1(h) is applicable, all
Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration, all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive (A) an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest cent),
without interest, equal to the product of (x) the Cash Consideration and (y) a
fraction (the "Non-Election Cash Fraction"), the numerator of which shall be the
Cash Election Number less the number of Cash Election Shares and the denominator
of which shall be the number of Non-Election Shares, and (B) a number of shares
of Valero Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) 1
minus the Non-Election Cash Fraction.

     (j) UDS shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause copies of the Form
of Election (which shall contain a Letter of Transmittal to be mailed with the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the record holders of UDS Common Stock
(other than holders of Dissenting Shares) as of the record date for the UDS
Stockholders Meeting) and to make the Form of Election available to all persons
who become record holders of UDS Common Stock during the period between such
record date and the Election Deadline. A properly completed Form of Election
must be received by the Exchange Agent by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on



                                      -15-

<PAGE>


the second business day preceding the Closing Date (the "Election Deadline"),
which day shall not be less than 20 days after the initial mailing of the Form
of Election, in order to be effective. An election by a holder of UDS Common
Stock shall be validly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have timely
received a Form of Election properly completed and executed (with the signature
or signatures thereon guaranteed as required by the Form of Election) by that
stockholder accompanied either by the UDS Certificate or UDS Certificates
representing all of the shares of UDS Common Stock owned by that stockholder,
duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books
of UDS, or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery in the form customarily used
in transactions of this nature from a member of a national securities exchange,
a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or a
commercial bank or trust company in the United States. All elections may be
revoked until the Election Deadline in writing by the record holders submitting
Forms of Election. Valero shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to
make all determinations as to whether or not a Form of Election has been timely
received.

     (k) Notwithstanding anything in this Article III to the contrary, the Cash
Election Number shall be not greater than the greatest number that would permit
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(c) and 7.3(c).

     3.2 Stock Options. (a) Each option to purchase UDS Common Stock (a "UDS
Stock Option") granted under UDS Stock Plans which is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares
of UDS Common Stock and shall be converted (as so converted, a "UDS Converted
Option"), at the Effective Time and subject to the immediately following
sentence, into an option to purchase Valero Common Stock (a "Valero Stock
Option"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the UDS
Stock Option. The number of shares of Valero Common Stock subject to each such
Valero Stock Option shall be the number of shares of UDS Common Stock subject to
the UDS Stock Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, to
the nearest whole share of Valero Common Stock, and such Valero Stock Option
shall have an exercise price per share (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of
a cent) equal to the per share exercise price specified in such UDS Stock Option
divided by the Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that in the case of any UDS
Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code as of the Effective Time (after
taking into account the effect of any accelerated vesting thereof) applies by
reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price,
the number of shares subject to such option and the terms and conditions of
exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. As of the Effective Time, Valero
shall assume the obligations of UDS under the UDS Stock Plans, and from and
after the Effective Time, except as otherwise set forth herein, the terms of
each UDS Stock Option and the UDS Stock Plan under which such UDS Stock Option
was initially granted, in each case, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall continue to apply to the corresponding Valero Stock
Option.

     (b) Prior to the Effective Time, UDS shall take all necessary action for
the adjustment of UDS Converted Options under this Section 3.2. Valero shall
reserve for issuance a number of shares of Valero Common Stock at least equal to
the number of shares of Valero Common Stock that will be subject to UDS
Converted Options. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Valero
shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor, or if


                                      -16-

<PAGE>


Form S-8 is not available, other appropriate, forms) with respect to the shares
of Valero Common Stock subject to UDS Converted Options and shall maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein)
for so long as such options remain outstanding.

     3.3 Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Valero shall appoint
Computershare Investor Services, LLC, or a commercial bank or trust company, or
a subsidiary thereof, reasonably acceptable to UDS, to act as exchange agent
hereunder for the purpose of exchanging UDS Certificates for the Merger
Consideration (the "Exchange Agent"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Valero
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of
shares of UDS Common Stock, (a) certificates representing shares of Valero
Common Stock and (b) cash, to be issued and paid pursuant to Sections 3.1(b) and
(d) and Section 3.7 in exchange for outstanding shares of UDS Common Stock upon
due surrender of UDS Certificates pursuant to this Article III. Following the
Effective Time, Valero agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time
to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions
pursuant to Section 3.5. Any cash and certificates representing Valero Common
Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including the amount of any dividends
or other distributions payable with respect thereto and cash in lieu of
fractional shares to be paid pursuant to Section 3.7) shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Exchange Fund".

     3.4 Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Valero shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a UDS Certificate (other than
UDS Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) that has not timely submitted a
properly completed and executed Form of Election accompanied by an appropriately
endorsed Certificate or Certificates representing all of the shares of Company
Common Stock owned by that shareholder (or, alternatively, by an appropriate
guarantee of delivery) (a) a letter of transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal")
that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the UDS Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the UDS
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which Letter of Transmittal shall be in
customary form and have such other provisions as Valero or UDS may reasonably
specify (such letter to be reasonably acceptable to UDS and Valero prior to the
Effective Time) and (b) instructions for effecting the surrender of such UDS
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, together with any
dividends and other distributions with respect thereto and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares. Upon surrender of a UDS Certificate to the Exchange Agent
together with such Letter of Transmittal or the Form of Election pursuant to
Section 3.1(j), duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such UDS Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (i) shares of Valero Common Stock (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is requested by
such holder or is otherwise required by applicable law or regulation)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1(b) or 3.1(d) (in each case, after
taking into account all shares of UDS Common Stock then held by such holder),
(ii) a check in the amount equal to the cash, if any, that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 3.1, and (iii) a check in the amount equal
to the cash, if any, that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III other than Section 3.1, including cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of Valero Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.7 and
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.5. No interest will be
paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to



                                      -17-

<PAGE>


the provisions of this Article III. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
UDS Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of UDS, one or
more shares of Valero Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper
number of shares of Valero Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1, a check in the
proper amount of cash representing Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1, a
check in the proper amount of cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Valero
Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.7 and any dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.5, may be issued with
respect to such UDS Common Stock to such a transferee if the UDS Certificate
representing such shares of UDS Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

     3.5 Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered UDS Certificate with respect to the shares of Valero
Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of
such UDS Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Valero
Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.7 until such
holder shall surrender such UDS Certificate in accordance with Section 3.1(j) or
Section 3.4. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following the later of
the surrender of any such UDS Certificate and the Effective Time, there shall be
paid to the record holder thereof without interest, (a) promptly after such
time, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Valero
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.7 and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Valero
Common Stock and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date subsequent thereto and to such surrender payable with respect to such
shares of Valero Common Stock.

     3.6 No Further Ownership Rights in UDS Common Stock. All shares of Valero
Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of UDS Common Stock
in accordance with the terms of this Article III (including any cash paid
pursuant to Section 3.5 or 3.7) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of UDS Common Stock.

     3.7 No Fractional Shares of Valero Common Stock. No certificates or scrip
or shares of Valero Common Stock representing fractional shares of Valero Common
Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of UDS Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of
Valero or a holder of shares of Valero Common Stock. In lieu of any such
fractional share, each holder of shares of UDS Common Stock who would otherwise
have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Valero Common Stock upon
surrender of UDS Certificates (determined after taking into account all UDS
Certificates delivered by such holder) shall be paid upon such surrender cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to the value (determined with reference to
the closing price of a share of Valero Common Stock as reported on the NYSE
Composite Tape on the last full trading day immediately prior to the Closing
Date) of such fractional interest. Such payment with respect to fractional
shares is merely intended to provide a mechanical rounding off of, and is not a
separately bargained for, consideration.



                                      -18-

<PAGE>


     3.8 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of UDS Certificates one year after the
Effective Time shall, at Valero's request, be delivered to Valero or otherwise
on the instruction of Valero, and any holders of UDS Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article III shall after such delivery look only
to Valero for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of UDS Common
Stock formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant
to Sections 3.1 and 3.4, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Valero Common
Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 3.7 and any
dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Valero Common Stock to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 3.5. Any such portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of UDS Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
law, become the property of Valero free and clear of any claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

     3.9 No Liability. None of Valero, UDS or the Exchange Agent shall be liable
to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

     3.10 Investment of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Valero on a daily basis;
provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable or the timing of the amounts payable to UDS stockholders pursuant to the
other provisions of this Article III. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall promptly be paid to Valero.

     3.11 Lost Certificates. If any UDS Certificate (other than any UDS
Certificate representing Dissenting Shares) shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such UDS Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Valero,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Valero may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such UDS Certificate, following the Effective Time the Exchange Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed UDS Certificate the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of UDS Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Valero Common
Stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Valero Common Stock
deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

     3.12 Withholding Rights. Valero shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity
by Valero, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Valero.

     3.13 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name



                                      -19-

<PAGE>


and on behalf of the Surviving Corporation or UDS, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation or UDS, any other actions and things necessary to vest,
perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     4.1 Representations and Warranties of UDS. Except as disclosed in a section
of the UDS disclosure schedule delivered to Valero concurrently herewith (the
"UDS Disclosure Schedule") corresponding to the subsection of this Section 4.1
to which such disclosure applies, UDS hereby represents and warrants to Valero
as follows:

     (a) Corporate Organization. (i) UDS is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
UDS has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is
duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the
nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified
would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on UDS. True and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and
the By-Laws of UDS, as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available by UDS to Valero.

          (ii) Each Subsidiary of UDS (A) is duly organized and validly existing
     under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (B) is duly qualified
     to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal,
     state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the
     conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in which the
     failure to be so qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect on UDS, and
     (C) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its
     properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

     (b) Capitalization. (i) The authorized capital stock of UDS consists of (A)
250,000,000 shares of UDS Common Stock (each of which includes one UDS Right),
of which, as of May 1, 2001, 71,524,496 shares were issued and outstanding,
2,234,812 shares were held in the GSOP and 17,116,837 shares were held in
treasury and (B) 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of UDS ("UDS Preferred Stock," together with the UDS Common Stock, the
"UDS Capital Stock"), of which no shares are issued and outstanding. From May 1,
2001 to the date of this Agreement, no shares of UDS Capital Stock have been
issued except pursuant to employee and director stock plans of UDS in effect as
of the date hereof (the "UDS Stock Plans"). Except pursuant to the terms of
options, stock and restricted units issued pursuant to UDS Stock Plans and
outstanding as of the date hereof or issued thereafter as expressly permitted
hereby, and pursuant to the UDS Rights, UDS does not have and is not bound by
any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares
of UDS Capital Stock or any other equity securities of UDS or any securities of
UDS representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of UDS
Capital Stock. As of May 1, 2001, no shares of UDS Capital Stock were reserved
for issuance, except for 12,525,465 shares of UDS Common Stock reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of stock options pursuant to the UDS Stock Plans and
in respect of the employee and director savings, compensation and deferred
compensation plans described in the UDS 2000 10-K, and no shares of UDS Common
Stock reserved for issuance in connection with the UDS Rights Agreement. UDS has
no Voting Debt issued or outstanding.

          (ii) Except for immaterial amounts of directors' qualifying shares in
     foreign Subsidiaries of UDS, UDS owns, directly or indirectly, all of the
     issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership
     interests of each Subsidiary of UDS, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
     charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever ("Liens"), and all
     of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and
     validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
     rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No
     Subsidiary of UDS has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions,
     options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any character
     calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any
     other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the
     right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any
     other equity security of such Subsidiary. Section 4.2(b)(ii) of the UDS
     Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each material investment of UDS in
     any corporation, joint venture, partnership, limited liability company or
     other entity other than its Subsidiaries, which, individually or taken
     together in the aggregate, would be considered a Significant Subsidiary if
     such investment constituted control of such entity (each a "Non-Subsidiary
     Affiliate").

     (c) Authority; No Violation. (i) UDS has full corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
approved by the Board of Directors of UDS. The Board of Directors of UDS has
directed that this Agreement be submitted to UDS stockholders for approval at a

Approval"), no other corporate proceedings on the part of UDS are necessary to
approve this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by UDS and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Valero) constitutes a

     under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,
     mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other
     instrument or obligation to which UDS, any of its Subsidiaries or
     Non-Subsidiary Affiliates is a party, or by which they or any of their
     respective properties or assets may be bound or affected, except (in the
     case of clause (B)(y) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches or
     defaults which either individually or in the aggregate will not have a
     Material Adverse Effect on UDS or the Surviving Corporation.

                                      -22-

<PAGE>

          (iv) Since December 31, 2000, UDS has not declared any dividends on

statute, order, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity relating to UDS or
any of its Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such license,

contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this

     Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, as applicable, and in full force and
     effect, (B) UDS and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects
     performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under each

     Effect on UDS, and (C) neither UDS nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or
     has received notice of, the existence of any event or condition which
     constitutes, or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a
     material default on the part of UDS or any of its Subsidiaries under any
     such UDS Contract, except where such default, either individually or in the

     Effect on UDS.

     (k) Environmental Liability. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral
or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental
investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any
nature seeking to impose, or that could reasonably result in the imposition of,
on UDS, any liability or obligation arising under common law or under any local,
state or federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance including
CERCLA, pending or threatened in writing against UDS, which liability or
obligation, either individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on UDS. UDS is not subject to any
agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any court,

     (D) the most recent annual financial report, if any; (E) the most recent
     actuarial report, if any; and (vi) the most recent determination letter
     from the Internal Revenue Service, if any. Except as specifically provided
     in the foregoing documents delivered or made available to Valero, there are

     UDS or any of its Subsidiaries undertaken to make any such amendments or to

                                      -25-

<PAGE>


          (iii) Section 4.1(l)(iii) of the UDS Disclosure Schedule identifies
     each UDS Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning
     of Section 401(a) of the Code ("UDS Qualified Plans"). The Internal Revenue
     Service has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each
     UDS Qualified Plan and the related trust, and such determination letter has
     not been revoked. No circumstances exist and no events have occurred that
     could adversely affect the qualified status of any UDS Qualified Plan or
     the related trust, which could not be corrected under the Internal Revenue
     Service's Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (Revenue Procedure
     2001-17) without material liability. No UDS Plan is intended to meet the
     requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9).

          (iv) All contributions required to be made to any UDS Plan by
     applicable law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
     undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
     policies funding any UDS Plan, for any period through the date hereof have
     been timely made.

          (v) With respect to each UDS Plan that is subject to Title IV or
     Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code: (A) there does not
     exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412
     of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived; (B) the fair
     market value of the assets of such UDS Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial
     present value of all accrued benefits under such UDS Plan (whether or not
     vested) on an accumulated benefits obligation basis based on the most
     recent actuarial report for each such plan; (C) no reportable event within
     the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice
     requirement has not been waived has occurred, and the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the
     occurrence of any such reportable event; (D) all premiums to the Pension
     Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") have been timely paid in full;
     (E) no liability (other than for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV
     of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by UDS or any of its
     Subsidiaries; and (F) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate
     any such UDS Plan and, to UDS's knowledge, no condition exists that
     presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which would
     constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or
     the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such UDS Plan.

          (vi) (A) No UDS Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that
     has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under
     common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple
     Employer Plan"); and (B) none of UDS and its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA
     Affiliates has incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been
     satisfied in full. With respect to each UDS Benefit Plan that is a
     Multiemployer Plan, none of UDS and its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
     respective ERISA Affiliates has received any notification, nor has any
     reason to believe, that any such Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization,
     has been terminated, is insolvent, or may reasonably be expected to be in
     reorganization, to be insolvent, or to be terminated.

          (vii) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
     the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on UDS, (A) each of the
     UDS Plans has been operated and administered in all material respects in
     accordance with applicable law and administrative rules and regulations of
     any Governmental Entity, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code,
     and (B) there are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for
     benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been
     asserted or instituted against the UDS Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with
     respect to their duties to the UDS Plans or the assets of any of the trusts
     under any of the UDS Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in
     any material liability of UDS or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the
     U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Labor, any UDS
     Plan, any participant in a UDS Plan, or any other party.

          (viii) UDS and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health,
     medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or
     dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage as required by
     Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and at no expense
     to UDS and its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of UDS, UDS and each of its
     Subsidiaries has reserved the right to amend, terminate or modify at any
     time all plans or arrangements providing for retiree health or life
     insurance coverage.

          (ix) Section 4.1(l)(ix) of the UDS Disclosure Schedule sets forth (A)
     an accurate and complete list of each UDS Plan under which the execution
     and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
     contemplated hereby could (either alone or in conjunction with any other
     event), result in, cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of,
     or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit (including the
     forgiveness of indebtedness) to any employee, officer or director of UDS or
     any of its Subsidiaries, or could limit the right of UDS or any of its
     Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets
     from any UDS Plan or related trust or any material employment agreement or
     related trust, (B) a reasonable good faith estimate of the maximum amount
     of the severance benefits that could become payable to officers and senior
     management of UDS if their employment were terminated at the Effective
     Time, and (C) a reasonable good faith estimate of the maximum amount of the
     "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code
     that could become payable by UDS and its Subsidiaries in connection with
     the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated hereby.

          (x) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
     aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on UDS, all UDS Benefit Plans
     subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States (A)
     have been maintained in accordance with all applicable requirements; (B) if
     they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet all
     requirements for such treatment; and (C) if they are intended to be funded
     and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate,
     based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.



                                      -27-

          (xi) With respect to any UDS Benefit Plan that is an "employee stock
     ownership plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code (an
     "ESOP"), (A) each loan under which the ESOP was a borrower (each, a "Loan")
     has been fully repaid, and (B) all of the securities of UDS that were

Valero has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified
would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on Valero. True and complete copies of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws of Valero, as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by Valero to UDS.

          (ii) Each Subsidiary of Valero (A) is duly organized and validly
     existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (B) is duly
     qualified to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether
     federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
     property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and
     in which the failure to be so qualified would have a Material Adverse
     Effect on Valero and (C) has all requisite corporate power and authority to
     own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
     conducted.

such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no
personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No Subsidiary of Valero

<PAGE>


individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material

or bound by any contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether

employee thereof, (B) which is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in
Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) to be performed after the date of

on Valero, any liability or obligation arising under common law or under any
local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or ordinance including
CERCLA, pending or threatened in writing against Valero, which liability or
obligation, either individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Valero. Valero is not subject to
any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or memorandum by or with any
court, governmental authority, regulatory agency or third party imposing any
liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing that, either individually
or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Valero.

<PAGE>


a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code ("Valero
Qualified Plans") and the related trust, and such determination letter has not
been revoked. No circumstances exist and no events have occurred that could
adversely affect the qualified status of any Valero Qualified Plan or the
related trust which could not be corrected under the Internal Revenue Service's
Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (Revenue Procedure 2001-17) without
material liability to Valero. No Valero Plan is intended to meet the
requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9).(i)

     Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code: (A) there does not
     exist any accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412
     of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived; (B) the fair
     market value of the assets of such Valero Plan equals or exceeds the
     actuarial present value of all accrued benefits under such Valero Plan
     (whether or not vested) on an accumulated benefit obligation basis, based
     on the most recent actuarial report for such plan; (C) no reportable event
     within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice
     requirement has not been waived has occurred, and the consummation of the
     transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the
     occurrence of any such reportable event; (D) all premiums to the PBGC have
     been timely paid in full; (E) no liability (other than for premiums to the
     PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by
     Valero or any of its Subsidiaries; and (F) the PBGC has not instituted
     proceedings to terminate any such Valero Plan and, to Valero's knowledge,
     no condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will be
     instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA
     for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any
     such Valero Plan.

          (iii) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
     the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Valero, (A) each of the
     Valero Plans has been operated and administered in all material respects in
     accordance with applicable law and administrative rules and regulations of
     any Governmental Entity, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code,
     and (B) there are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for
     benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been
     asserted or instituted against the Valero Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries
     thereof with respect to their duties to the Valero Benefit Plans or the
     assets of any of the trusts under any of the Valero Benefit Plans which
     could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of Valero
     or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the U.S. Department of the
     Treasury, the U.S. Department of Labor, any Valero Benefit Plan, any
     participant in a Valero Benefit Plan, or any other party.

          (iv) No Valero Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple
     Employer Plan.

     (m) Intellectual Property. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Valero, (i) Valero and its Subsidiaries own,
or are licensed to use, all Intellectual Property used in and necessary for the
conduct of their business as it is currently



                                      -35-

<PAGE>


conducted, (ii) to the knowledge of Valero, the use of Intellectual Property by
Valero and its Subsidiaries does not infringe on or otherwise violate the rights
of any third party, and, to the extent such Intellectual Property is licensed,
its use is in accordance in all material respects with the applicable license
pursuant to which Valero acquired the right to use such Intellectual Property,
(iii) to the knowledge of Valero, no third party is challenging, infringing on
or otherwise violating any right of Valero in the Intellectual Property, (iv)
neither Valero nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of
any pending claim, order or proceeding with respect to any Intellectual Property
used in and necessary for the conduct of Valero's and its Subsidiaries' business
as it is currently conducted, and (v) to the knowledge of Valero, no
Intellectual Property is being used or enforced by Valero or its Subsidiaries in
a manner that would reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment,
cancellation or unenforceability of any Intellectual Property used in and

such party or any contract requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict
or prohibit access to any such properties or information or (ii) the information
is subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party. The parties will
hold any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.3 in confidence in
accordance with, and shall otherwise be subject to, the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement dated April 23, 2001, between UDS and Valero (the

their respective Subsidiaries or the conducting of their business in a specified
manner. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 6.4 shall limit a party's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) or 8.1(c) so long as such party has up to
then complied with its obligations under this Section 6.4.

     (d) Each of Valero and UDS and their respective Boards of Directors shall,
if any state takeover statute or similar statute (including, without limitation,
Section 203 of the DGCL) becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated hereby, take all action reasonably necessary to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

     6.5 Acquisition Proposals. (a) UDS agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of UDS or its Subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries' employees, agents and representatives (including any investment
banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to,
or a transaction to effect, a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution
or similar transaction involving UDS or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or
any purchase or sale of 20% or more of the consolidated assets (including stock
of its Subsidiaries) of it and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any
purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, its equity securities
that, if consummated, would result in any Person (or the stockholders of such
Person) beneficially owning securities representing 20% or more of its total
voting power (or of the surviving parent entity in such transaction) or the
voting power of any of its Significant Subsidiaries (any such proposal, offer or
transaction (other than a proposal or offer made by any other party to this
Agreement or an Affiliate thereof) being hereinafter referred to as an
"Acquisition Proposal"), (ii) have any discussion with or provide any
confidential information or data to any Person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal, or
knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement

     (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, UDS (and
its Board of Directors) shall be permitted to (A) comply with Rule 14d-9 and
Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal (to the extent applicable), (B) effect a Change in the UDS
Recommendation, or (C) engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide
any information to, any Person in response to an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, if and only to the extent that, in any
such case referred to in clause (B) or (C), (I) the UDS Stockholders Meeting
shall not have occurred other than as a result of a breach by UDS of its
obligations pursuant to Section 6.1, (II) (x) in the case of clause (B) above,
it has received an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a
third party and its Board of Directors concludes in good faith that such
Acquisition



                                      -47-

<PAGE>


Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) in the case of clause (C)
above, its Board of Directors concludes in good faith that there is a reasonable
likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal could constitute a Superior Proposal,
(III) in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, its Board of Directors, after
receipt of the advice of UDS's outside counsel, determines in good faith that
there is a reasonable probability that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (IV) prior to
providing any information or data to any Person in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal by any such Person, its Board of Directors receives from
such Person an executed confidentiality agreement having provisions that are
customary in such agreements, as advised by counsel, provided that if such
confidentiality agreement contains provisions that are less restrictive than the
comparable provision, or omits restrictive provisions, contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, then the Confidentiality Agreement will be deemed to
be amended to contain only such less restrictive provisions or to omit such
restrictive provisions, as the case may be, and (V) prior to providing any
information or data to any Person or entering into discussions or negotiations
with any Person, it notifies Valero promptly of such inquiries, proposals or
offers received by, any such information requested from, or any such discussions
or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, any of its
representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or
offers. UDS agrees that it will promptly keep Valero reasonably informed of the
status and terms of any inquiries, proposals or offers and the status and terms
of any discussions or negotiations, including the identity of the party making
such inquiry, proposal or offer. UDS agrees that it will, and will cause its
officers, directors and representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date
of this Agreement with any parties (other than the parties to this Agreement)
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. UDS agrees that
it will use reasonable best efforts to promptly inform its directors, officers,
key employees, agents and representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 6.5. Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall (x) permit UDS to terminate this
Agreement (except as specifically provided in Article VIII hereof) or (y) affect
or limit any other obligation of Valero or UDS under this Agreement.

     6.6 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Section 8.2, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
Expenses, except Expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and
mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4, which shall be
shared equally by Valero and UDS.

     6.7 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance. Following the
Effective Time, Valero shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors, officers and
employees of UDS and its Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) (A) to the
same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of
expenses as of the date of this Agreement by UDS pursuant to UDS's Certificate
of Incorporation, By-laws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence
on the date hereof with, or for the benefit of, any directors, officers and
employees of UDS and its Subsidiaries and (B) without limitation to clause (A),
to the fullest extent permitted by law, in each case for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby), (ii) include and cause to be
maintained in effect in the



                                      -47-

<PAGE>


Surviving Corporation's (or any successor to the business of the Surviving
Corporation) certificate of incorporation and by-laws for a period of six years
after the Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement
of expenses which are, in the aggregate, no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the current
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of UDS and (iii) cause to be maintained
by the Surviving Corporation (or any successor to the business of the Surviving
Corporation) for a period of six years after the Effective Time the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by UDS (provided that Valero (or any such successor) may
substitute therefor one or more policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no
event shall Valero (or any such successor) be required to expend in any one year
an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by UDS for
such insurance; and, provided further that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Valero (or any such successor) shall
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount. The obligations of Valero (or any such successor) under this
Section 6.7 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.7 applies without the consent of
such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom
this Section 6.7 applies and their respective heirs and other representatives
shall be third-party beneficiaries of, and entitled to enforce, this Section
6.7).

     6.8 Employee Benefits. (a) Following the Effective Time until the first to
occur of (i) the first anniversary of the Effective Time and (ii) December 31,
2002 (such shorter period referred to herein as the "Benefit Protection
Period"), Valero shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to individuals
who are employees of UDS and its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective
Time and who continue to be employed by Valero and its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time (the "UDS Employees") Benefit Plans (other than any equity-based
UDS Benefit Plans) that are, in the aggregate, not less favorable than those
generally provided to UDS Employees as of the date hereof, as disclosed by UDS
to Valero immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. After the expiration
of the Benefit Protection Period, Valero shall provide, or cause to be provided,
to UDS Employees compensation and employee benefit plans and programs that are,
in the aggregate, not less favorable than those generally provided to other
similarly situated employees of Valero and its Subsidiaries. After the Effective
Time, the equity-based benefits to be provided to an eligible UDS Employee shall
be pursuant to the equity-based benefit plans and programs provided to similarly
situated employees of Valero. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to
prevent the termination of employment of any UDS Employee; provided, however,
that in the event of a qualifying termination of any UDS Employee during the
Benefit Protection Period, Valero shall provide, or cause to be provided, to
such terminated UDS Employee severance benefits that are not less than the
amount of severance benefits that would have been payable under the terms of the
UDS severance plan or policy listed on Section 6.8(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter as in effect as of the date hereof that is applicable to any such UDS
Employee. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, UDS
Employees who are covered under a collective bargaining agreement shall be
provided the benefits that are required by such collective bargaining agreement
from time to time.

     (b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Valero and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any UDS Employee after the Effective Time
(the "New Plans"), each UDS Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with UDS and its Subsidiaries and predecessor employers before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such UDS Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar UDS Benefit Plans,
except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each UDS
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces
coverage under a UDS Benefit Plan in which such UDS Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old
Plans"); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any UDS Employee, Valero shall cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and
Valero shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as
if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing long-term or short-term disability, life
insurance or other welfare benefits (other than medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits) to any UDS Employee, Valero shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or
her covered dependents.

     (c) Valero will honor, in accordance with their terms, all vested and
accrued benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former
employees of UDS and its Subsidiaries which are disclosed on UDS's Disclosure
Schedules, including, without limitation, the "change of control" provisions
contained in the UDS Benefit Plans listed on the Section 6.8(c) of the Valero
Disclosure Schedule. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as
preventing Valero from amending, modifying or terminating any UDS Benefit Plan
or other contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding, in accordance with
their terms and applicable law.

     6.9 Public Announcements. Valero and UDS shall use reasonable best efforts
to develop a joint communications plan and each shall use reasonable best
efforts (i) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such
joint communications plan and (ii) unless otherwise required by applicable law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing any press release
or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition to the
foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1, and
subject to Section 6.5(b), neither Valero nor UDS shall issue any press release
or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure concerning the other party
or the other party's business, financial condition or results of operations
without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

Directors of UDS shall not, without the prior written consent of Valero, (i)
amend or waive any provision of the UDS Rights Agreement or (ii) take any action

Stockholders Meeting, UDS shall deliver to Valero a letter identifying all
persons who, in the judgment of UDS, may be deemed at the time this Agreement is
submitted for adoption by the stockholders of UDS, "affiliates" of UDS for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act and applicable SEC rules and
regulations, and such list shall be updated as necessary to reflect changes from
the date thereof. UDS shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each person
identified on such list to deliver to Valero not later than ten days prior to

Article II or Article III of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
UDS or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to
Valero, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

     6.14 UDS Indebtedness. With respect to UDS Indebtedness issued under
indentures qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and any other UDS
Indebtedness the terms of which require Valero to assume such debt in order to
avoid default thereunder (collectively, the "Assumed Indentures"), Valero shall
execute and deliver to the trustees or other representatives in accordance with
the terms of the respective Assumed Indentures, supplemental indentures or other
instruments, in form satisfactory to the respective trustees or other

     8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors of the
terminating party or parties, and except as specifically provided below, whether
before or after the Valero Stockholders Meeting or the UDS Stockholders Meeting:

     (a) By mutual written consent of Valero and UDS;

     (b) By either Valero or UDS, if the Effective Time shall not have occurred

right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement (including such party's obligations set forth in Section 6.4) has been
the primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur
on or before the Termination Date;

     (c) By either Valero or UDS, if any Governmental Entity (i) shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (which the parties

in Sections 7.1(c), (d) or (e), as applicable, and such denial of a request to
issue such order, decree, ruling or the failure to take such other action shall
have become final and nonappealable (which order, decree, ruling or other action
the parties shall have used their reasonable best efforts to obtain, in
accordance with Section 6.4); provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available to any party

Agreement and before such termination an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
UDS shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the senior
management, Board of Directors or stockholders of UDS, or UDS shall have
breached in any material respect its obligations under Section 6.5, and (III)
within twelve months of such termination UDS or any of its Subsidiaries enters
into any definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, or the Board of
Directors of UDS or any of its Subsidiaries recommends that its respective
stockholders approve, adopt or accept, any Acquisition Proposal, or (B) Valero
shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(i), then UDS shall
promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day after the date of such
termination (or, in the case of clause (A), if later, the date UDS or its
Subsidiary enters into such agreement with respect to or consummates such
Acquisition Proposal), pay Valero an amount equal to the UDS Termination Fee, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds.

     (c) If (A) (I) (x) either UDS or Valero terminates this Agreement pursuant

to obtain the Valero Stockholder Approval) or pursuant to Section 8.1(b) without
the Valero Stockholders Meeting having occurred or (y) UDS terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f), (II) at any time after the date of this

and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of 50% or more of its total voting
power, whether by merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, tender offer
or exchange offer or similar transaction and (III) within twelve months of such
termination Valero or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any definitive
agreement with respect to, or consummates, or the Board of Directors of Valero
or any of its Subsidiaries recommends that its respective stockholders approve,
adopt or accept, a transaction contemplated by clause (II), or (B) UDS shall
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then Valero shall promptly,
but in no event later than one Business Day after the date of such termination
(or, in the case of clause (A), if later, the date Valero or its Subsidiary
enters into such agreement with respect to or consummates the transaction
contemplated by clause (II)), pay UDS an amount equal to the Valero Termination
Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

     (d) If UDS terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g), UDS shall
pay Valero in an amount equal to the UDS Termination Fee, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, concurrently with such termination.

     (e) The parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither party would enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if either



                                      -55-

<PAGE>


party fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in
order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in
a judgment against such party for the fee set forth in this Section 8.2, such
party shall pay to the other party its costs and expenses (including attorneys'
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.6.
The parties hereto agree that any remedy or amount payable pursuant to this
Section 8.2 shall not preclude any other remedy or amount payable hereunder, and
shall not be an exclusive remedy, for any willful and material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

     8.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after the Valero Stockholder Approval or the UDS Stockholder Approval,
but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further
approval by such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties hereto.

     8.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,

any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to
this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

     9.5 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. (a) This Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the exhibits and schedules hereto and the other
agreements and instruments of the parties delivered in connection herewith
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, except that, for purposes of the definition of "best
efforts" as used in Sections 6.4(a) and 6.4(c) and interpreting the right of UDS
to terminate this Agreement under Section 8.1(f) upon breach by Valero of
Sections 6.4(a) and 6.4(c), the parties agree that it is proper to refer to the
course of their discussions prior to entering into this Agreement.

     (b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of

accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to

party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole
or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written

other party hereto or its successors or assigns may be brought and determined in
the Chancery or other Courts of the State of Delaware, and each of Valero and
UDS hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for

                                      -58-
<PAGE>

nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each of Valero and UDS hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure to lawfully
serve process, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction
of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), (c) to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in

                            Form of Affiliate Letter


Valero Energy Corporation
One Valero Place
San Antonio, Texas 78212

Ladies and Gentlemen:

            I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be
an "affiliate" of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("UDS"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and
(d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). I have been further advised that pursuant
to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 6, 2001 (the
"Merger Agreement"), by and between Valero Energy Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Valero"), and UDS, UDS will merge with and into Valero (the
"Merger"), and that as a result of the Merger, I may receive shares of Valero
Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) in exchange for shares of UDS
Common Stock (as defined in the Merger Agreement) owned by me. Valero will be
the surviving corporation in the Merger and is sometimes referred to herein as
the "Surviving Corporation."

            I represent, warrant and covenant to Valero that in the event I
receive any Valero Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

(a)  I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Valero
     Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

(b)  I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed
     its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,
     transfer or otherwise dispose of Valero Common Stock to the extent I
     believed necessary with my counsel or counsel to UDS.

(c)  I have been advised that the issuance of Valero Common Stock to me pursuant
     to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a
     Registration Statement of Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that,
     since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the
     shareholders of UDS, I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of UDS and
     the distribution by me of Surviving Corporation Common Stock has not been
     registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
     the Valero Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale,
     transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such
     sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume
     and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the
     Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Valero or
     under a "no-action" letter obtained by me from the staff of the Commission,
     such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
     registration under the Act.


                                      -61-
<PAGE>


(d)   I understand that Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to register
      the sale, transfer or other disposition of the Valero Common Stock by me
      or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in
      order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration
      available.

(e)   I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to the
      Surviving Corporation's transfer agents with respect to the Valero Common
      Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates for the Valero
      Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating
      in the substance:

            The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
            transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act
            of 1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in
            compliance with the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a
            registration statement under said act or an exemption from such
            registration.

(f)   I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Valero Common Stock
      issued to me as a result of the Merger has been registered under the Act
      or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, the
      Surviving Corporation reserves the right to put the following legend on
      the certificates issued to my transferee:

            The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered
            under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who
            received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated
            under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been
            acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in
            connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of
            Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise
            transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
            registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.

It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f)
above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such
legend if the undersigned shall have delivered to the Surviving Corporation a
copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving Corporation, to the
effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Act. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) such legends will be removed by delivery of substitute
certificates upon written request of the undersigned if at the time of making
such request the undersigned would be permitted to dispose of the Valero Common
Shares represented by such certificates pursuant to Rule 145(d)(2); (ii) nothing
contained herein shall be construed as an admission that I am an "affiliate", or
as a waiver of any rights that I may have to object to any claim that I am such
an affiliate on or after the date of this letter, and (iii) this letter
agreement shall terminate if and when the Merger Agreement is terminated
according to its terms.
