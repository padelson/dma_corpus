anything to the contrary in this Agreement, SUT, and its board of directors (the "Board") and a special committee comprised of the independent directors of the Board (the

financial advisor, who may be interested in acquiring all or any portion of the Business, the DNE Shares and the Superior Israel Shares (collectively, the "Assets to be Sold") and (2)&nbsp;enter
into definitive purchase and sale documentation with respect to all or any portion of the Assets to be Sold with a Prospective Purchaser, but only if and to the extent that (A)&nbsp;in the case of

constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B)&nbsp;prior to providing any information or data to a Prospective Purchaser or entering into any discussions or negotiations with a Prospective Purchaser,
Sellers receive from such Prospective Purchaser an executed confidentiality agreement, in a form advised by outside counsel. SUT will notify Alpine, on a current basis, if any such proposals or offers
are made by, or any such discussions or negotiations are entered into with, any Prospective Purchaser indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Prospective Purchaser and the
material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and thereafter shall keep Alpine informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any
such negotiations or discussions. "Superior Proposal" means an Acquisition Proposal made by a Prospective Purchaser on terms which the Special Committee in good faith concludes (following receipt of
the advice of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into account, among other things, all terms and conditions of the proposal and all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects
of the proposal and the Prospective Purchaser making the proposal, (x)&nbsp;would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to SUT and its
stockholders (other than Alpine) and creditors taken as a whole, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y)&nbsp;is reasonably likely to be completed. </FONT></P>
