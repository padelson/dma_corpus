ARTICLE 3 
 CONSIDERATION

  

 3.1 _ Purchase Price._ 

  

 The aggregate cash purchase price for the Purchased Assets, the DNE Shares and the Superior Israel Shares (the "Purchase Price") is (a) Eighty-Five Million Dollars ($85,000,000) _plus_ (b) the aggregate amount of any expenditures set forth on _Schedule 3.1_, to the extent paid prior to Closing by any of the Sellers _minus_ (c) any applicable amount payable under the Side Letter relating to the valuation of certain real property in Columbia City, Indiana, dated the date hereof, among the parties hereto, payable at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account(s) designated in writing by SUT at least two business days prior to the Closing Date. As additional consideration for the Purchased Assets, Buyer shall cause a warrant in the form of _Exhibit A _hereto (the "Warrant") to be issued to SUT on the Closing Date. 

   

 3.2 _ Allocation of Purchase Price._ 

  

 The sum of (i) the Purchase Price, (ii) the value of the Warrant and (iii) the amount of the Assumed Liabilities (the "Aggregate Purchase Price") shall be allocated to the Superior Israel Shares, to the DNE Shares and to the Purchased Assets for purposes of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and for all other Tax purposes. The allocations to the Superior Israel Shares and the DNE Shares shall be as set forth in _Schedule 3.2_. The excess of the Aggregate Purchase Price over the amounts allocated to the Superior Israel Shares and the DNE Shares is the "Remaining Aggregate Purchase Price". Within 30 days following the Closing Date SUT shall provide Buyer with a proposed determination of the Remaining Aggregate Purchase Price and a proposed allocation of the Remaining Aggregate Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code and all other Tax purposes. Within 20 days of receipt of such proposed determination and allocation Buyer shall notify SUT whether Buyer has any objection to the proposed determination or allocation. If Buyer has no such objection, or timely notice is not provided, then Buyer and Sellers agree to be bound by such determination and allocation and to complete and attach Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 to the respective U.S. Tax returns accordingly and to file all other tax returns accordingly and not to take any position inconsistent therewith. If Buyer timely objects to the proposed determination or allocation, Buyer and SUT agree to attempt in good faith to resolve such disagreement. If any such disagreement is not resolved within 10 days following SUT\'s receipt of notice from Buyer of Buyer\'s objection, the disagreement shall be submitted to a public accounting firm (the "Expert") mutually agreed upon by Buyer and SUT. Buyer and Sellers shall instruct the Expert to make a determination regarding the item or items in dispute within 20 days of receipt of the dispute. Buyer and Sellers agree to be bound by any joint resolution of a disagreement described in this Section and by any determination of the Expert and to complete and attach Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 to the respective U.S. Tax returns accordingly and to file all other tax returns accordingly and not to take any position inconsistent therewith. 

  

ARTICLE 4

 (a) own, lease and operate the Purchased Assets and carry on the Business as
and where such Purchased Assets are now owned, leased or operated and as and
where such Business is presently being conducted; and (b) execute, deliver
and perform this Agreement and all other agreements and documents to be
executed and delivered by it in connection herewith.

   

 4.2 _ Seller\'s Enforceability._ 

  

 All requisite corporate action to approve, execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and each other agreement and document to be delivered by any Seller in connection herewith has been taken by each Seller. This Agreement and each other agreement and document to be delivered by any Seller in connection herewith have been, or will be, duly executed and delivered by the applicable Sellers and constitute, or will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligations of such Sellers, enforceable against such Sellers in accordance with their respective terms except to the extent that such enforcement is limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and by general equity principles. 

  

 4.3 _ Consents._ 

  

 No authorization, approval, consent, permit or order of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any federal, state, local or foreign government, or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, or any court, tribunal or arbitrator (each, a "Governmental Authority"), or other Person is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by any Seller or any other agreement, instrument or document to be delivered by or on behalf of any Seller in connection herewith, except for (i) such filings as may be required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), (ii) filings and notifications under the Connecticut Transfer Act (C.G.S.A. §22a-134 _et seq._ , as amended) ("Connecticut Transfer Act") and the Indiana Responsible Property Transfer Law (Ind. Code §13-25-3-1 _et seq_.)

 10.1.3 _ Reasonable Efforts._ 

    

 On and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, (a) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents and approvals from any Governmental Authority and the making of all necessary registrations and filings with and notices to, and the taking of all commercially reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority, (b) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals and waivers from third parties, (c) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (d) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that none of any Seller, Alpine, or Buyer shall be obligated with respect to such efforts (i) to expend any funds except the payment of the reasonable fees and expenses of any applicable attorneys, consultants or other advisors retained by it or (ii) to take any actions with respect to the Purchased Assets, the Business, the business of the DNE Group or the Superior Israel Group which, in its reasonable judgment, is materially adverse, including, but not limited to, agreeing to any modification of a contract term. 

    

 10.1.4 _ Seller Disclosure Schedule and Supplemental Disclosure._ 

    

 (a) On or prior to the date hereof, Sellers have delivered to Buyer the Seller Disclosure Schedule setting forth, among other things, items of disclosure relating to any or all of the representations and warranties of Sellers; _provided_ , that the mere inclusion of an item in the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed an admission by any of the Sellers that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item would result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Business or the business of the DNE Group or the Superior Israel Group, materially impair the ability of any Seller to perform its obligations hereunder or prevent the consummation by any Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (b) Each party will promptly notify the other party in writing if it is in, or becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or constitutes a, breach of any of its representations or warranties as of the date of this Agreement, or if it becomes aware of the existence or occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact or condition that would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement) cause or constitute a breach of any of its representations or warranties had any such representation or warranty been made as of the 

   

     
  

 time of the existence, occurrence or discovery of such fact or condition.
The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 10.1.4 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to a party receiving such
notice.

    

 10.1.5 _ Superior Proposal._ 

    

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, SUT, and its board of directors (the "Board") and a special committee comprised of the independent directors of the Board (the "Special Committee"), on behalf of or together with any of the Sellers or their respective Affiliates, as the case may be, shall be permitted to (1) engage in discussions and negotiations with, and provide information (including, without limitation, this Agreement and all Exhibits and Schedules hereto) to certain Persons (each, a "Prospective Purchaser"), determined together with Sellers\' financial advisor, who may be interested in acquiring all or any portion of the Business, the DNE Shares and the Superior Israel Shares (collectively, the "Assets to be Sold") and (2) enter into definitive purchase and sale documentation with respect to all or any portion of the Assets to be Sold with a Prospective Purchaser, but only if and to the extent that (A) in the case of clause (2), the Special Committee concludes in good faith that the offer or proposal made by such Prospective Purchaser with respect to the Assets to be Sold (an "Acquisition Proposal") constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) prior to providing any information or data to a Prospective Purchaser or entering into any discussions or negotiations with a Prospective Purchaser, Sellers receive from such Prospective Purchaser an executed confidentiality agreement, in a form advised by outside counsel. SUT will notify Alpine, on a current basis, if any such proposals or offers are made by, or any such discussions or negotiations are entered into with, any Prospective Purchaser indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Prospective Purchaser and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and thereafter shall keep Alpine informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such negotiations or discussions. "Superior Proposal" means an Acquisition Proposal made by a Prospective Purchaser on terms which the Special Committee in good faith concludes (following receipt of the advice of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into account, among other things, all terms and conditions of the proposal and all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Prospective Purchaser making the proposal, (x) would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, to SUT and its stockholders (other than Alpine) and creditors taken as a whole, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (y) is reasonably likely to be completed. 

    

 10.1.6 _ Termination._ 

    

 This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: 

    

 (a) By mutual written consent of Sellers, Alpine and Buyer; 

  

 (b) By Sellers if Alpine or Buyer shall have failed to perform or comply with any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement such that any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(a) and (c) would not be satisfied, which failure to perform or comply has not been cured within 30 days following receipt by Alpine or Buyer of notice of such failure to perform or comply; 

  

 (c) By Buyer if any Seller shall have failed to perform or comply with any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement such that any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(a) and (b) would not be satisfied, which failure to perform or comply has not been cured within 30 days following receipt by such Seller of notice of such failure to perform or comply; 

    

      

 (d) By either Sellers or Buyer if (i) the Closing has not been effected on or prior to the close of business on December 15, 2002, _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or prior to the aforesaid date, or (ii) any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; 

  

 (e) (i) By Sellers if there has been (x) a material breach by Alpine or Buyer of any of its representations or warranties that is not qualified as to materiality or (y) a breach by Alpine or Buyer of any of its representations or warranties that is qualified as to materiality, in each case, which would materially impair the ability of Alpine or Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement or prevent the consummation by Alpine or Buyer of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which breach has not been cured within 30 days following receipt by Alpine or Buyer of notice of the breach, or (ii) by Alpine or Buyer if there has been (x) a material breach by any Seller of any of its representations or warranties that is not qualified as to materiality or (y) a breach by any Seller of any of its representations or warranties that is qualified as to materiality, in each case, which would result in, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Business or the business of the DNE Group, which breach has not been cured within 30 days following receipt by Sellers of notice of the breach; 

  

 (f) By Sellers simultaneously with their execution of a definitive purchase and sale agreement (but specifically excluding a non-binding letter of intent) with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 10.1.5; 

  

 (g) By Alpine or Buyer if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to the close of business on November 30, 2002, unless Sellers have irrevocably waived in writing their right to enter into definitive purchase and sale documentation with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 10.1.5 and to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1.6(f). 

     

 10.1.7 _ Effect of Termination._ 

    

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Sellers or Buyer, as provided in Section 10.1.6, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability hereunder on the part of Alpine, Buyer or any of the Sellers or their respective shareholders, officers, employees, directors, agents or Affiliates (except as set forth in this Section 10.1.7, Section 10.2.4 and Section 10.2.5, which shall survive the termination); _provided, however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 10.1.7 shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any breach of its obligations under this Agreement. 

  

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1.6(f) or (g), SUT shall, within two business days after the date of such termination, pay to Alpine or Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Alpine or Buyer, up to $1.5 million of actual, reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Alpine or Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, subject to offset for amounts paid or previously paid by or on behalf of SUT pursuant to Section 10.2.19. 

    

 10.1.8 _ Other Business Real Property Liens._ 

    

 Prior to Closing, Sellers shall take any and all actions as may be necessary to cure or remove (or otherwise provide Buyer with reasonable evidence of payment of) any Liens, which 

   

     

 are monetary in nature, other than Real Property Permitted Encumbrances,
affecting the Business Real Property.

   

  

 10.2 _ Other Covenants._ 

  

  

 10.2.1 _ Employee and Related Matters._ 

    

 (a) _ Employees._ Buyer or an Affiliate thereof shall make an offer of employment, effective as of the Closing Date, to all employees of the Business set forth on _Schedule 10.2.1(a)_, except for employees of the Business who terminated employment prior to the Closing Date or who became eligible for long-term disability benefits prior to the Closing Date, and shall retain on the Closing Date substantially all employees engaged in the respective businesses of the DNE Group and the Superior Israel Group, in each case on terms and conditions which, except as set forth in this Section 10.2.1, are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to such employees by Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be construed as to prevent Buyer or its Affiliates from terminating the employment of any employee at any time after the Closing Date for any reason (or no reason). Employees who are retained or who accept Buyer\'s offer of employment and commence working for Buyer or an Affiliate thereof immediately following the Closing Date are hereinafter referred to as "Transferred Employees." Any Transferred Employee on short-term disability as of the Closing Date that would have become eligible for long-term disability benefits under the Sellers\' long-term disability plan but for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be covered by the Sellers\' long-term disability plan and Buyer shall have no obligation to provide such coverage. 

  

 (b) _ Defined Contribution Plans._ 

    

 (i) _ Multiple Business Plans._ On the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event later than 180 days following the Closing Date), Buyer shall permit any Transferred Employee who has an account balance (a "Participant") under any tax-qualified defined contribution plan established or maintained by the Sellers or its Affiliates on behalf of employees of the Business (the "Business Employees") as well as other employees of the Sellers and its Affiliates (the "Seller 401(k) Plans") to roll over (whether by direct or indirect rollover, as selected by such Participant) his or her "eligible rollover distribution" (as defined under Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) in the form of cash, a promissory note (as described below) or such other property as reasonably acceptable to Buyer that relates solely to investment vehicles available under the Buyer 401(k) Plan (as defined hereinafter) or any combination thereof from the Seller 401(k) Plans to a retirement plan established by Buyer or its Affiliates that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and that contains a cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan"). The account balances of Business Employees who participate in the Seller 401(k) Plans shall be fully vested as of the Closing Date and the Seller shall take any actions necessary to ensure that such account balances are distributable from the Seller 401(k) Plans on and after the Closing. The Sellers and the Seller 401(k) Plans shall not place any Participant\'s plan loan into default or declare a default with respect to any plan loan so long as such Participant transfers his or her account balance under the Seller 401(k) Plans, together with the promissory note evidencing the plan loan and the applicable loan documentation, to the Buyer 401(k) Plan through a direct rollover as soon as practicable after the Closing Date. Such loan shall be assumed and continued by the Buyer 401(k) Plan in a manner substantially similar to the Seller 401(k) Plans. Sellers shall amend the Seller 401(k) Plans to the extent necessary in order to effectuate the transactions contemplated under this Section 10.2.1(b). 

    

      

 (ii) _ Stand-Alone Plans._ As a result of Buyer\'s purchase of the DNE Shares contemplated by this Agreement, the DNE Technologies, Inc. Savings Plan (the "DNE Plan") shall continue in effect after the Closing Date as a plan sponsored by Buyer or one of its Affiliates and the account balances of employees of the DNE Group ("DNE Employees" and, together with Business Employees, "Affected Employees") shall not be distributable from the DNE Plan. 

    

 (c) _ Defined Benefit Plans._ With respect to each of the Retirement Income Plan for Salaried Employees of Essex Group, Inc. (the "Salaried Plan") and the Retirement Income Plan for Hourly Employees of Essex Group, Inc. (the "Hourly Plan", together with the Salaried Plan, the "Seller Pension Plans"), the parties agree as follows: 

    

 (i) _ Hourly Plan._ (A) Sellers shall retain all liabilities and obligations in respect of benefits accrued by employees of the Business who participate in the Hourly Plan ("Covered Employees"). Benefit accruals in respect of Covered Employees under the Hourly Plan shall cease as of the Closing Date and the Covered Employees participating therein shall be considered to have terminated employment for purposes of such plan. Sellers shall fully vest the accrued benefits of the Covered Employees under the Hourly Plan as of the Closing Date. No assets under the Hourly Plan shall be transferred to Buyer or any of its Affiliates or to any plan of Buyer or its Affiliates. 

   

 (B) Buyer or an Affiliate thereof shall establish a retirement plan for Transferred Employees who participate in the Hourly Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that contains a benefit formula that is the same as under the Hourly Plan (the "Buyer Hourly Plan"). Benefit accruals in respect of such employees under the Buyer Hourly Plan shall commence as of the Closing Date and shall only take into account service performed and compensation earned on and after the Closing Date; provided, that service performed prior to the Closing Date for Sellers and their Affiliates shall be taken into account for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit (but not for purposes of benefit accrual) under the Buyer Hourly Plan. 

  

 (ii) _ Salaried Plan._ Buyer shall establish a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan (which may be a component of the Buyer 401(k) Plan) for Transferred Employees who participate in the Salaried Plan that provides for an employer contribution in lieu of the benefit provided to such employees under the Salaried Plan. 

    

 (d) _ Other Liabilities._ Without limiting the scope of Section 10.2.1(a), Buyer shall cause each Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) to be covered following on and after the Closing Date by a group health plan (within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) that (i) does not limit or exclude coverage on the basis of any pre-existing condition of such Transferred Employee or dependent, and (ii) provides each Transferred Employee full credit, for the year during which the Closing Date occurs, with any deductible already incurred by the Transferred Employee under any welfare benefit arrangement sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Sellers or any Seller ERISA Affiliate (a "Seller Welfare Arrangement") providing group health benefits to such Transferred Employee or dependent and with any other out-of-pocket expenses that count against any maximum out-of-pocket expense provision under such Seller Welfare Arrangement or Buyer\'s Welfare Plan. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, (i) Sellers shall remain responsible for all claims incurred or made by Transferred Employees prior to the Closing Date under any Business Benefit Plan or state workers\' compensation statute, or, with respect to Transferred Employees employed in the Business, which arise out of or relate to (A) any event, action or omission occurring prior to the Closing Date or (B) such employee\'s employment (including the termination thereof) prior to the Closing Date and (ii) Buyer shall 

   

     

 be responsible for all claims incurred or made by Transferred Employees on
or after the Closing Date under any Buyer Benefit Plan or state workers\'
compensation statute, or, with respect to Transferred Employees employed in
the Business, which arise out of or relate to (A) any event, action or
omission occurring prior to the Closing Date or (B) such employee\'s
employment (including the termination thereof) prior to the Closing Date. For
purposes of clarity, a medical/dental claim shall be considered incurred when
the medical/dental services are rendered or medical/dental supplies are
provided, and not when the condition arose. A disability or workers\'

Buyer may not settle such a dispute or proceeding without the prior consent of Sellers, not to be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a party may settle a dispute involving a Tax liability for which it is responsible without obtaining the consent of any other party if the settlement involves only a concession of an amount of Tax liability to be paid by the settling party. 

  

 (e) Buyer shall be entitled to all refunds of Non-Consolidated Income Taxes of the Transferred Subsidiaries for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2002.

 Each party hereto agrees that, as requested by the other party after the Closing, it will do all such further acts as may be required to effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby and to vest in Buyer title to the Purchased Assets, the DNE Shares and the Superior Israel Shares. To the extent that the assignment of any lease, contract, commitment or right pertaining to the Business shall require the consent or waiver of other parties thereto, which consent or waiver has not been obtained prior to the Closing, Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a consent is not obtained for any Business Real Property Lease, such Business Real Property Lease shall not be deemed assigned under this Agreement, and Buyer shall not have any liabilities or obligations thereunder until such consent is obtained. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (i) Sellers shall do all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws as reasonably requested by Buyer to put Buyer in effective possession, ownership and control of the Purchased Assets and Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers for that purpose and (ii) Buyer shall do all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws as reasonably requested by Sellers to put Sellers (or such other Person as Sellers shall indicate) in effective possession, ownership and control of the Retained Assets and Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer for that purpose.

 10.2.9 _ Mail and Other Communications._ 

    

 After the Closing, Sellers shall promptly remit to Buyer any checks, cash, payments, mail or other communications relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities that are received by Sellers after the Closing Date, unless the same also relates to the Retained Assets or the Retained Liabilities, in which case Sellers shall send copies thereof.

 10.2.11 _ Credit Support Arrangements._ 

    

 Alpine and Buyer acknowledge that Sellers have entered into arrangements in which guarantees, letters of credit or other credit arrangements, including surety and performance bonds, were issued by or for the account of Sellers to support or facilitate business transactions by the Business, the DNE Group or the Superior Israel Group. Such arrangements are referred to herein as the "Credit Support Arrangements." Each of Alpine and Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as practicable, (i) obtain replacement Credit Support Arrangements or (ii) repay, or cause the repayment of, all debt and other obligations to which such Credit Support Arrangements relate (and cause the cancellation of such Credit Support Arrangements) or arrange for Alpine, Buyer or one of their respective Affiliates to be substituted as the obligor thereof, obtaining from the creditor a full release of the applicable Seller or their respective Affiliates, (the foregoing arrangements in clauses (i) and (ii) are collectively referred to as "Replacement Credit Support Arrangements"). Sellers shall cooperate fully with Buyer in connection with the foregoing. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 11, Alpine shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers from and against all Losses (as defined herein) incurred by any of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates following the Closing as a result of Alpine or Buyer\'s inability to enter into Replacement Credit Support Arrangements by the Closing Date, including, without limitation, their expenses in maintaining any such Credit Support Arrangement whether or not any such Credit Support Arrangement is drawn upon, and shall in any event promptly reimburse the respective Seller or any of its Affiliates to the extent any Credit Support Arrangement is called upon and such entity makes any payment thereunder or is obligated to reimburse the party issuing the Credit Support Arrangement or to the extent that the beneficiary under any Credit Support Arrangement refuses to accept such substitute 

   

     

 letter of credit or other guarantee proffered by Buyer by the Closing Date.
In no event shall Alpine and Buyer be liable to Sellers for any nonperformance
by any Seller with respect to any obligation under any Credit Support
Arrangement prior to the Closing.

    

 10.2.12 _ Non-Competition._ 

    

 (a) For a period of four years after the Closing Date, none of Alpine, Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries (other than Superior Cables Ltd.) (each, a "Buyer Restricted Party" and, collectively, the "Buyer Restricted Parties") shall, directly or indirectly, anywhere in the world, engage in any business conducted as of the date hereof by SUT or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the Business and the respective businesses of the DNE Group, the Superior Israel Group and Superior Cables Ltd. as currently conducted ("Buyer Competitive Activity"); _provided, however_ , that it shall not be a violation of this Section 10.2.12(a) for a Buyer Restricted Party to (i) own any debt securities or other debt obligations (other than convertible debt) of any Person, (ii) invest in, own an interest in or acquire all or a majority of the stock or assets of any Person that is not "engaged primarily in a Buyer Competitive Activity" (as defined below), (iii) invest in securities representing less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding capital stock of any Person, the securities of which are publicly traded or listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system, or (iv) through the Business, sell the Excepted Products (as defined below) in a manner consistent with past practice on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Supply and Transitional Services Agreement. For purposes of this Section 10.2.12(a), "engaged primarily in a Buyer Competitive Activity" shall mean that at least 30% of the consolidated net revenue derived during the last complete fiscal year of the acquired Person is derived from a Buyer Competitive Activity. "Excepted Products" means any Private Label Premises Product (to be defined in the Supply and Transitional Services Agreement) manufactured by SUT or any of its Subsidiaries as currently manufactured at Closing. 

  

 (b) For a period of seven years after the Closing Date, none of Sellers or any of their respective Subsidiaries (each, a "Seller Restricted Party" and, collectively, the "Seller Restricted Parties") shall, directly or indirectly, anywhere in the world, engage in any business that is competitive with the Business, the business of the DNE Group or (with respect to Israel only) the business of the Superior Israel Group, in each case as conducted on the date hereof ("Seller Competitive Activity"); provided, however, that it shall not be a violation of this Section 10.2.12(b) for a Seller Restricted Party to (i) own any debt securities or other debt obligations (other than convertible debt) of any Person, (ii) invest in, own an interest in or acquire all or a majority of the stock or assets of any Person that is not "engaged primarily in a Seller Competitive Activity" (as defined below), or (iii) invest in securities representing less than five percent (5%) of the outstanding capital stock of any Person, the securities of which are publicly traded or listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. For purposes of this Section 10.2.12(b), "engaged primarily in a Seller Competitive Activity" shall mean that at least 30% of the consolidated net revenue derived during the last complete fiscal year of the acquired Person is derived from a Seller Competitive Activity. 

  

 (c) The parties hereto agree that the covenants set forth in this Section 10.2.12 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law. If all or any part of this Section 10.2.12 is held invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Each of Alpine and Buyer agrees that in the event of a breach or threatened breach by it or any of its Subsidiaries of the provisions of this Section 10.2.12, money damages would not be an adequate remedy and that the other party shall be entitled to seek temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of posting a bond. If any part of this Section 10.2.12 is held to be excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity 

   

     
  

 or subject, such part will be construed by limiting and reducing it so as to
be enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with applicable law.

 (a) Sellers shall use reasonable efforts to investigate the Wallingford Property prior to the Closing ("the Pre-Closing Investigation") to determine whether it is appropriate to prepare and submit a Form II (as defined under the Connecticut Transfer Act) to Buyer and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection ("CTDEP") with respect to the Wallingford Property. Sellers shall be responsible for the cost of the Pre-Closing Investigation up to an amount not to exceed $10,000 and Buyer shall be responsible for any costs associated with the Pre-Closing Investigation that exceed $10,000. In the event that Sellers determine that a Form II (as defined under the Connecticut Transfer Act) can be prepared and submitted to Buyer and the CTDEP with respect to the Wallingford Property, Sellers shall be responsible for: (i) preparing the Form II and submitting the same to Buyer and the CTDEP, and (iii) paying the filing fees associated with filing the Form II with the CTDEP.

 Effective as of 12:01 AM on the Closing Date, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the DNE Group and the Superior Israel Group shall cease to be insured by the Sellers\' or their respective Affiliates\' insurance policies; _provided, however_ , that with respect to insurance coverage written on an "occurrence basis," to the extent the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities are insured under such policies, Buyer shall have rights under such policies for Assumed Liabilities to the extent the events giving rise to a claim under such policies occurred prior to 12 midnight on the Closing Date. Sellers agree to cooperate with Buyer at Buyer\'s expense (i) in asserting and prosecuting claims under Sellers\' insurance policies in connection with insurable events that occurred prior to 12 midnight on the Closing Date, and (ii) by executing appropriate assignments to the extent permitted by law, and Sellers shall remit any recoveries promptly to Buyer.
