  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 11, 2008 (this " _Agreement_ "), between LS Cable Ltd., a Korean corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Superior Essex Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 

 WHEREAS, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof Parent shall form an indirect, wholly owned Delaware subsidiary for the purpose of acting as Purchaser hereunder (the " _Purchaser_ "). Parent shall immediately thereafter cause Purchaser to execute a joinder to this Agreement and assume all rights and obligations of the Purchaser hereunder (the " _Joinder_ ");

 

 WHEREAS, Parent and the Board of Directors of the Company has approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

 WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Parent has agreed to cause Purchaser to (and pursuant to the Joinder, Purchaser shall agree to) commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Shares_ "), at a price of $45.00 per Share, net to the seller in cash (such price, or any higher price as may be paid in the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), without interest;

 

 WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Purchaser shall merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") and each Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, which will be canceled with no consideration paid in exchange therefor, and other than Dissenting Shares) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, all upon the terms and conditions set forth herein;

 

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has, by the unanimous vote of the directors present, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (i) determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the stockholders of the Company, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares to Purchaser and, to the extent applicable, adopt the "agreement of merger" (as such term is used in Section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ")) set forth in this Agreement;

 

 WHEREAS, following the formation of Purchaser, Parent shall cause the Board of Directors of Purchaser to, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously approve and declare advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and Parent or a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (in each case, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Purchaser) shall adopt the "agreement of merger" set forth in this Agreement in each case, in accordance with the DGCL; and WHEREAS, as an inducement to and condition to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement certain executives have each entered into an employment agreement with the Company (the " _Employment Agreements_ "), which shall become effective at the Purchase Time.

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent and the Company hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I 
  
 THE OFFER

 

 SECTION 1.1. _The Offer_. (a) (i) Provided that Parent and Purchaser shall not have delivered (and been entitled to deliver) a notice of the Companys breach with respect to the Companys obligations under Section 6.3 (unless all such breaches set forth therein shall have been cured) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")), not later than July 2, 2008 ( _provided_ that the Company shall be prepared to disseminate to its stockholders its Schedule 14d-9 and Schedule 14f-1 within such time period) the Offer to purchase all outstanding Shares at the Offer Price. The obligations of Purchaser (and of Parent to cause Purchaser) to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be July 30, 2008 (the " _Expiration Date_ ", unless Purchaser shall have extended the period of time for which the Offer is open pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 1.1(a)(iii), in which event the term "Expiration Date" shall mean the latest time and date as the Offer, as so extended, may expire). Purchaser expressly reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) at any time or from time to time in its sole discretion to waive any Offer Condition or modify or amend the terms of the Offer, except that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price or change the form of the consideration payable in the Offer, (B) decrease the number of Shares sought pursuant to the Offer, (C) amend or waive the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in _Exhibit A_ ), (D) add to the conditions set forth on _Exhibit A_ , (E) modify the conditions set forth on _Exhibit A_ in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares or in a manner that would delay consummation of the Offer, (F) reduce the time period during which the Offer shall remain open, or (G) extend the Expiration Date except as required or permitted by Section 1.1(a)(iii) . If, prior to the Purchase Time, this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VIII, Purchaser shall (notwithstanding clause (F) of the previous sentence) promptly terminate the Offer without accepting any Shares for payment and shall return the Shares tendered promptly after such termination.

 

 (ii) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the satisfaction or (other than in the case of the Minimum Tender Condition, except with the prior written consent of the Company) waiver by Purchaser of the Offer Conditions as of the time of any Expiration Date, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, accept for payment (the date of acceptance for payment, the " _Purchase Date_ " and the time of acceptance for 

  payment, the " _Purchase Time_ ") and pay for Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after such Expiration Date. If the
Purchase Date occurs and Purchaser does not acquire (and would not own
following an exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with the second to
last sentence of Section 1.5(a)) a number of Shares sufficient to enable a
merger to be consummated without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL or if a delay is anticipated in
completing the Merger because all Required Merger Regulatory Approvals have
not yet been received, Purchaser shall provide for subsequent offering periods
for the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of not
more than five (5) Business Days at a time until (i) Purchaser shall have
acquired a number of Shares sufficient to enable a merger to be consummated
without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section
253 of the DGCL (taking into account an exercise of the Top-Up Option), and
(ii) all Required Merger Regulatory Approvals shall have been received;
_provided_ that such subsequent offering periods shall not exceed an aggregate
of twenty (20) business days (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act); _provided further_ that Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to, immediately accept and promptly pay for all Shares

The Company shall, subject to any limitations imposed by applicable Laws, also use its reasonable best efforts to cause individuals designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage of each committee of the Company Board (and of each board of directors and each committee thereof of each wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company) as the percentage of the entire Company Board represented by individuals designated by Purchaser. The Companys obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. At the request of Purchaser, the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect any such election or appointment of

  Purchasers designees, including mailing to its stockholders the information
required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated

 (b) Following the election or appointment of Purchasers designees pursuant to Section 1.4(a) and prior to the Effective Time, (i) any amendment or termination of this Agreement requiring action by the Company Board, (ii) any extension of time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement, (iii) any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions under this Agreement that are for the benefit of the Company, (iv) any exercise of the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement, and (v) any action to seek to enforce any obligation of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement (or any other action by the Company Board with respect to this Agreement or the Merger if such other action adversely affects, or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, any of the holders of Shares other than Parent or Purchaser) may only be authorized by, and shall be undertaken by the Company upon the authorization of, a majority of the Continuing Directors. The Continuing Directors shall have the authority to retain counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the reasonable expense of the Company as determined appropriate by the Continuing Directors for the purpose of fulfilling their obligations hereunder and shall have the authority, after the Purchase Time, to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

 

 (c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board pursuant to Section 1.4(a), until the Effective Time, the Company shall use its best efforts (and Parent shall cooperate with such efforts) to cause the Company Board to always have at least two (2) members who were members of the Company Board as of immediately prior to the Purchase Time and who are independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq (each such member a " _Continuing Director_ " and, collectively, " _Continuing Directors_ "). If prior to the Effective Time, (i) the number of directors who are Continuing Directors is reduced to one (1), the remaining director who is a Continuing Director shall be entitled to designate one (1) person to the Company Board who is not an officer, director, employee or designee of Parent or any of its Affiliates and who shall be considered a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement, and (ii) there shall be no Continuing Directors for any reason, then the Company Board shall promptly designate two (2) individuals to serve on the Company Board who were members of the Company Board prior to the Purchase Time and who are independent directors for purposes of the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, provided that if no such individual is willing or able to serve on the Company Board, the Company Board shall promptly designate two (2) individuals to serve on the Company Board who are not officers, directors, employees or designees of Parent or its Affiliates (and in each case, the persons so designated shall be considered Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement). Until the Effective Time, the audit committee of the Company Board shall be composed solely of independent directors as required by the Nasdaq rules.

  SECTION 1.5. _Top-Up Option_. (a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Purchaser an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only after the acceptance by Purchaser of, and payment for, Shares tendered in the Offer, to purchase (for cash or a note payable) that number (but not less than that number) of Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") as is equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent or Purchaser at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the total Shares then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares) at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price (which price shall be payable either (A) entirely in cash or (B) in cash in an amount equal to the aggregate par value of the purchased Top-Up Option Shares and by the issuance of a full recourse note with a principal amount equal to the remainder of the exercise price); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, and only on or prior to the tenth (10th) Business Day (or such later date as shall be approved by the Continuing Directors) after the latest of the Expiration Date, the expiration date of any subsequent offering period and the receipt of all Required Merger Regulatory Approvals, (ii) in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Shares in excess of the Companys then authorized and unissued Shares (including as authorized and unissued Shares, for purposes of this Section 1.5, any Shares held in the treasury of the Company), and (iii) the Top-Up Option may not be exercised if (A) any provision of applicable Law or any judgment, injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Entity shall prohibit, or require any action, consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise, which action, consent, approval, authorization or permit, action, filing or notification has not theretofore been obtained or made, as applicable, or (B) after the issuance of Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option, it will be insufficient to allow Purchaser to effect the Merger without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Top-Up Option shall terminate concurrently with the termination of this Agreement. Purchaser shall promptly exercise the Top-Up Option if the shares issuable upon exercise thereof would be sufficient to allow Purchaser to effect the Merger without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL. Purchaser shall, concurrently with the exercise of the Top-Up Option, give written notice to the Company that, as promptly as practicable following such exercise, Purchaser intends to (and Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, as promptly as practicable after such exercise) consummate the Merger in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by Section 2.7.

 

 (b) Purchaser shall notify the Company in writing of its exercise of the Top-Up Option and shall set forth in such notice the number of Shares owned by Parent and Purchaser immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares. The closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares shall take place at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York, on the second Business Day, after the delivery of such notice (or such earlier time as the parties may agree). The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Parent and Purchaser in writing of the number of Shares then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the Top-Up Option, Parent shall cause Purchaser to pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares and the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares.

  (c) Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares may include any legends required by applicable securities Laws.

 

 (d) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Shares that Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, and will be upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act). Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise thereof are being and will be acquired for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act.

Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss 

  in lieu thereof), together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may customarily be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor

otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.4(b), each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting
Shares, which shall have those rights, and only those rights, provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article III.

 

 (c) At any time following the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration.

Paying Agent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, and are paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity in accordance with
applicable Law, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of

This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Purchaser and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser enforceable against each of Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and any implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

 SECTION 5.6. _Brokers_. Except for Macquarie Securities Korea Limited, no broker, finder or investment banker is or will be entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission from the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by and on behalf of Parent or Purchaser.

 

 SECTION 5.7. _Financing_. Parent has, and at all times through the Purchase Date and the Closing will have, available sufficient cash, cash equivalents, fully committed and available lines of credit and definitive financing commitments to satisfy its obligations to permit Purchaser to purchase and pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer, to pay all fees and expenses related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be paid by it, and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent will provide, or cause to be provided, such funds to Purchaser or the Paying Agent at or prior to the Purchase Date and the Effective Time, respectively. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of the executed commitment letters (collectively, the " _Existing Debt Financing_

  _Commitments_ "), pursuant to which such lenders party thereto have
committed, subject to the terms thereof, to provide or cause to be provided
the amounts set forth therein (the " _Existing_ _Debt Financing_ "). The
Existing Debt Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and are
legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and the other parties thereto,
subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting
creditors rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law) and any implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies to
the funding of the Existing Debt Financing other than as set forth in the
Existing Debt Financing Commitments. Prior to the date of this Agreement, none
of the Existing Debt Financing Commitments has been modified or amended, and
the commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any
respect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach
on the part of Parent, Purchaser or any other party to the Existing Debt
Financing Commitments. As of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Purchaser (A)
is aware of any fact or occurrence that makes any of the assumptions or the
representations or warranties of Parent or any of its Affiliates party to the
Existing Debt Financing Commitments, in the Existing Debt Financing
Commitments inaccurate in any material respect, (B) has any reason to believe
that it will be unable to satisfy any term or condition of closing to be
satisfied by it or its affiliates contained in the Financing Commitments, and
(C) has any reason to believe that any portion of the Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby will not be available to
Parent and Purchaser at the Purchase Time and the Effective Time, as
applicable. Parent and Purchaser and any of their Affiliates party to the
Financing Commitments have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other
fees required by the Financing Commitments to be paid by them on or prior to
the date of this Agreement and shall in the future pay any such fees as they
become due. The Financing Commitments, if and when funded, together with
Parents available cash, cash equivalents, and fully committed and available
lines of credit, will provide Parent and Purchaser with financing at the
Purchase Time and the Effective Time, as applicable, sufficient to, and may be
used to, satisfy all of Parents and Purchasers obligations under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, amounts needed to purchase the
Shares pursuant to the Offer and pay the Merger Consideration, the payments
described in Section 3.2(g) of this Agreement, the funding, refinancing or
prepayment of the Companys outstanding Notes, and any fees and expenses of or
payable by Parent, the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation). To the extent
that availability under any fully committed line of credit comprises a portion
of the Financing, such availability shall not be utilized or reduced and shall
otherwise be maintained from the date hereof (or, if other than an Existing
Debt Financing Commitment, from the date that Financing replaces an Existing
Debt Financing Commitment) to the Closing Date.

The Parent Financial Statements fairly present, in all material respects, the results of operations for the periods and the financial condition of Parent as of the dates referred to in the Parent Financial Statements, all in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the Republic of Korea.

  SECTION 5.9. _Company Stock_. Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates is, nor at any time during the last three (3) years has it been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, or is the record holder of, Shares, and is not a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than this Agreement, the Financing Commitments and related agreements, arrangements or understandings with the counterparties thereto or with Parents financial advisor), for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any Shares.

 

 SECTION 5.10. _Independent Investigation_. In entering into this Agreement and each of the other documents and instruments relating to the Offer and the Merger referred to herein, each of Parent and Purchaser has relied solely upon its own investigation and analysis, and each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees (a) that, except for the specific representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule), none of the Company or its Affiliates nor any of their respective stockholders or Representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty, either express or implied, with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or their business, operations, technology, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition or prospects, or as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information (including any statement, document or agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any financial statements and any projections, estimates or other forward-looking information) provided (including in any management presentations, information or descriptive memorandum, data room, supplemental information or other materials or information with respect to any of the above) or otherwise made available to Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, stockholders, or Representatives and (b) that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company and its Affiliates and their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders, controlling persons or Representatives shall not have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to Parent, Purchaser or their Affiliates or any of their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders or Representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or state securities laws or otherwise) based upon any information provided or made available, or statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to Parent, Purchaser or their Affiliates or any of their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders, controlling persons or Representatives, except as and only to the extent expressly set forth in this Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule).

respect to such matters and it is the desire, intention and mutual

Subject to Section 6.3(b), the Company shall immediately cease as of the date hereof and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Persons conducted heretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly cause to be returned or destroyed all confidential information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any such Person.

 

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.3(a), if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Purchase Time, (i) the Company has received a written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal from a third party that did not result from a material breach by the Company of Section 6.3, and (ii) the Company Board determines in 

  good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the Company may, subject to
clauses (x) and (y) below, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, its
financing sources and their respective Representatives and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that
(x) the Company will not, and will use reasonable best efforts not to allow
its Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such Person
unless the Company has, or first enters into, a confidentiality agreement with
such Person containing confidentiality undertakings no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the letter agreement, dated as of April 22,
2008 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), by and between the Company and
Parent (it being agreed that such agreement need not contain any standstill or
other non-confidentiality provisions), and (y) the Company will as promptly as
practicable make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries provided or made available to such other Person
that was not previously provided or made available to Parent.

 

 (c) From and after the date hereof and prior to the Purchase Time, the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent in the event that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) any material inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, and shall include in such notice the material terms and conditions thereof (including a copy of any written Acquisition Proposal or inquiry)and the identity of the party making such proposal or inquiry, and shall keep Parent promptly apprised as to the status and any material developments concerning the same. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing non-public information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 6.3(b) and shall in no event begin providing such information or engaging in such discussions on negotiations prior to providing such notice. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would restrict the Companys ability to provide such information to Parent, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently party to any agreement that prohibits the Company from providing the information described in this Section 6.3(c) to Parent.

 

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.3 to the contrary, (i) the Company Board may, in the absence of any pending Acquisition Proposal, effect a Change of Board Recommendation if the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change of Board Recommendation would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the directors fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable law, and (ii) in response to a written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal from a third party that did not result from the Companys material breach of Section 6.3(a), if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement pursuant to clause (B) below, the Company Board may at any time prior to the 

  Purchase Time, effect a Change of Board Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii), and any purported termination
pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) shall be void and of no force or effect,
unless in advance of or substantially concurrently with such termination the
Company (1) pays the fee required by Section 8.5 and (2) enters into an
acquisition agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company Board may not effect a Change of Board
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause
(ii) unless (A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to
Parent, at least four (4) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "),
of its intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal (a
" _Qualifying Transaction Notice_ "), which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of
the party making such Superior Proposal and a copy of the proposed form of
acquisition agreement); provided, that in the event of any material revisions
to the terms of such Superior Proposal after the start of the Notice Period,
the Company shall be required to deliver a new Qualifying Transaction Notice
to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.3(d) with
respect to such new Qualifying Transaction Notice as if it had been the
initial Qualifying Transaction Notice, and the Notice Period shall be deemed
to have recommenced on the date of such new Qualifying Transaction Notice, and
(B) notwithstanding any adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement that Parent offers (a " _Revised Parent Offer_ ") (such offer to be
irrevocable until at least four (4) Business Days following the end of the
Notice Period) to enter into during such Notice Period and for which all
internal approvals have been obtained, the Company Board determines in good
faith that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal. If, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section
6.3(d), a Revised Parent Offer has been made, and the Company Board has
determined that the Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior
Proposal, but such Acquisition Proposal has subsequently been materially
modified and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel and its independent financial advisors, that such
modified Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and has
notified Parent of the terms of such modified Acquisition Proposal in
compliance with Section 6.3(c), then the Company Board may elect, in lieu of
again complying with the provisions of the further proviso to clause (ii) of
the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 6.3(d), to establish a
deadline (the " _Bid_ _Deadline_ ") and notify in writing Parent and the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal thereof (such written notice, the "
_Bid Deadline Notice_ "), to occur not less than three (3) nor more than seven
(7) Business Days after giving such notice, for the submission of final
proposals from both Parent and such Person (with each of Parent and such
Person required to agree to make no further proposals thereafter). If, within
seven (7) Business Days after the Bid Deadline, the Company Board again
reasonably determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal (as
so amended or modified) constitutes a Superior Proposal, it may terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company substantially concurrently pays the
fee required by Section 8.5 (it being understood that if the Company
establishes such a deadline and procedure pursuant to this sentence, the
Company shall not be required to comply with clauses (A) and (B) of the
further proviso to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence).

  (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders or taking any position with respect to the Merger if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside counsel, failure to so take and/or disclose likely would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or necessary to comply with obligations under federal securities Laws or the Nasdaq; _provided_ , that any public disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that does not include either an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal, or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Offer and the Merger, shall be deemed to be a Change in Board Recommendation (including for purposes of Section 8.4(c)) .

 

 (f) The Company shall not take any action to (i) exempt any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar provision of any other Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, or (ii) exempt any Person (other than Parent, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates) from the provisions on "control share acquisitions" contained in any Takeover Law or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, in each case unless such actions are taken substantially concurrently with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(b) .

 

 (g) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer or proposal made or renewed by a Person or group at any time after the date hereof which is structured to permit such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least twenty percent (20%) of the assets of, equity interest in, or businesses of, the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender offer or exchange offer or similar transaction, including any single or multi-step transaction or series of related transactions, in each case other than the Merger, and (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal (except the references in the definition thereof to "twenty percent (20%)" shall be replaced by "fifty percent (50%)") made in writing after the date hereof that the Company Board has determined in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel and after taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, including the financing terms thereof) is superior from a financial point of view to this Agreement and is reasonably capable of being consummated.

 

 SECTION 6.4. _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_. (a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Purchase Time and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain for the individuals employed by the Company at the Purchase Time (the " _Current Employees_ ") compensation and benefits provided under employee benefit plans of Parent that are at least as favorable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits maintained for and provided to Current Employees as a group immediately prior to the Purchase Time (it being understood that equity based compensation may be replaced with cash incentive plans); _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the Section 6.4(d), nothing in this Section 6.4 shall prevent the amendment or termination of any 

  Company Plan or interfere with the Surviving Corporations right or obligation
to make such changes as are necessary to conform with applicable Law. Nothing
in this Section 6.4 shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Current
Employee at any time.

 

 (b) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service rendered by Current Employees of the Company prior to the Purchase Time to be taken into account for all purposes of vesting and eligibility and accrual of benefits purposes (except for benefit accrual under (i) any defined benefit pension plan, if applicable, and (ii) newly established employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for which employees of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries do not receive service credit) under employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent as such service was taken into account under the corresponding Company Plans of the Company for those purposes. Current Employees will not be subject to any pre-existing condition limitation under any health employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any condition for which they would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding Company Plan in which they participated prior to the Purchase Time. Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to give such Current Employees credit under such employee benefit plans for copayments made and deductibles satisfied prior to the Purchase Time.

 

 (c) Section 6.4(a) and (b) shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in Section 6.4(a) or (b), express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of Section 6.4(a) or (b) or is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or modification of any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or limit in any way the right of Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any of its respective employee benefit plans or arrangements.

 

 (d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period commencing on the Purchase Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Purchase Time, to maintain without amendment adverse to participants, and to honor, the Companys Severance Pay Plan, as amended, as described on Section 6.4(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Severance Program_ "). In respect of the annual cash bonus payable to the Current Employees for service rendered in fiscal year 2008, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to (i) each such employee who remains employed through December 31, 2008 a cash bonus that is not lower than (x) one hundred percent (100%) of such employees target annual cash bonus for fiscal year 2008 or (y) with respect to Current Employees who participate in annual cash incentive programs for employees outside of the United States, the annual cash bonus which would have otherwise been payable to such Current Employee under the applicable annual cash incentive program pursuant to the terms thereof, and (ii) each such employee whose employment is terminated without Cause (as defined in the Company 2005 Incentive Plan or in the case of a Company Employee who is party to a Relevant Agreement that is a change of control agreement or employment agreement, as defined in the applicable Relevant Agreement) or in the case of a Company Employee who is party to a Relevant Agreement that is a change of control agreement or employment agreement, who resigns for Good Reason (as defined in the applicable Relevant 

  Agreement), in each case, on or after the Purchase Date but prior to December
31, 2008 a cash bonus no lower than that which would have been determined
under clause (i) of this sentence, prorated to reflect the partial year of
service (such payments collectively, the " _Bonus_ _Obligations_ "). The
amount set forth in the previous sentence shall be offset, if applicable, by
any amount paid pursuant to the terms of the Companys annual cash incentive
compensation programs with respect to fiscal year 2008. As of the Closing,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation (i) to honor, assume
expressly and agree to perform the Company Plans set forth in Section 6.4(d)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Relevant Agreements_ ") without
amendment other than in accordance with the terms of the Relevant Agreements,
in the case of the Relevant Agreements that are change of control agreements
or employment agreements, and without amendment adverse to participants with
respect to benefits accrued through the Purchase Time, in the case of all
other Relevant Agreements and (ii) to guarantee the due, prompt and faithful
performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of the obligations,
covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of the Company under the
Relevant Agreements. This Section 6.4(d) shall survive the consummation of the
Offer and the Merger and be binding on Parent and its respective successors
and assigns. If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity resulting from such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the applicable obligations
set forth in this Section 6.4(d) .

 

 SECTION 6.5. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) Parent and Purchaser agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents or in any agreement disclosed in Section 6.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Offer and Merger, (x) in the case of any such certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational document, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, and (y) in the case of any such agreement, in accordance with its terms. From and after the Purchase Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in this Section 6.5, and shall guaranty and stand surety for all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.5, without limit as to time. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser agree that, the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification of (as of or prior to the Control Time) the current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company than are currently provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals until the expiration of the statutes of limitations applicable to such matters or unless such amendment, modification or repeal is required by applicable Law.

 

 (b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any agreement or Company Plan described in Section 4.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, from and after the Purchase Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Laws, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each current and former officer, director 

  or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each Continuing
Director and each person who served at the request or on behalf of the Company
as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise or other entity (whether or not such other entity
or enterprise is affiliated with the Company) (each, together with such
persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and
collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines, amounts paid in settlement
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees
and disbursements, incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, arbitration, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out, relating to or in
connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred
whether before, at or after the Purchase Time or the Effective Time (including
acts or omissions or alleged acts or omissions in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or in connection with such
persons serving in any such capacity, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time (and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance
expenses in connection with any of the foregoing as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Laws; _provided_ that any Person to whom
expenses are advanced shall have provided an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is finally determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification by a court of competent jurisdiction).

 

 (c) The Company shall purchase by the Effective Time prepaid tail policies to the current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained on the date of this Agreement by the Company, which tail policies (i) shall not have an aggregate premium in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof to maintain the existing policies (which amount is set forth in Section 6.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule), (ii) shall be effective for a period from the Effective Time through and including the date six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time (covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby), and (iii) shall contain coverage that is at least as protective to such directors and officers as the coverage provided by such existing policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying an aggregate premium in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of such amount, the Company shall only be required to obtain (and the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to maintain) as much tail coverage as can be obtained by paying an aggregate premium equal to three hundred percent (300%) of such amount. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and shall cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other indemnification agreement or arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. This Section 6.5 shall survive the consummation of the Offer and the Merger and is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, any Person or entity referred to in clause (a) or (b) of this Section 6.5 (whether or not parties to this Agreement), their respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and 

  their respective successors and assigns. If the Surviving Corporation or any
of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
resulting from such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the applicable obligations
set forth in this Section 6.5.

 

 (e) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.5.

 

 SECTION 6.6. _Further Action; Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, to the extent required under the HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust Laws, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, and any other required filing or application under Foreign Antitrust Laws, as applicable, as promptly as practicable, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, to supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or such Foreign Antitrust Laws, as applicable, and to take all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act or to obtain consents, approvals or authorizations under Foreign Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable, including by requesting early termination of the waiting period provided for in the HSR Act.

 

 (b) Each of Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.6(a) to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) to the extent not prohibited by a Governmental Entity, promptly inform the other party of any communication and supply to the other party any written communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other United States or foreign Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

  (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Sections 6.6(a) and (b), if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including in order to resolve such objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 (d) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding, including without limitation defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 (e) Without limiting the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, Parent, Purchaser and the Company, as applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall take any action necessary to avoid and eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act, other U.S. antitrust Laws, any Foreign Antitrust Laws, and the Exon-Florio Amendment (as defined below) so as to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably possible, including, without limitation, (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, mitigation agreement or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries and Affiliates or of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after consummation of the Offer would limit Parents or its Subsidiaries and Affiliates freedom of action with respect to, or its or their ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, Company and their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates and, if requested by Parent, Company should agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate, or otherwise take or commit to take any actions that limit its freedom of action with respect to, or Parents or Parents Subsidiaries and Affiliates ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), provided that any such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Offer and the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 

  in this Agreement, Parent and Purchaser shall not be obligated to take or
proffer to take any of the foregoing actions if such actions would be
reasonably likely in the aggregate to have (x) a material adverse effect on
the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 (f) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain all required regulatory approvals to be able to enter into an agreement to guaranty, effective on and after the Purchase Date, the Companys obligations under the Employment Agreements and, if such approvals are obtained, shall promptly enter into such a guaranty agreement.

 

 (g) Prior to the Purchase Time, the parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers of third parties with respect to any Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as may be necessary or appropriate for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or required by the terms of any Contract as a result of the execution, performance or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the Purchase Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party to obtain any consent, approval or waiver required with respect to any such Contract.

 

 (h) Subject to the provisions of the final sentence of this Section 6.6(h), the parties hereto agree to cooperate to promptly make all appropriate voluntary filings and other disclosures in respect of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under Section 721 of the United States Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the " _Exon-Florio Amendment_ ") with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (" _CFIUS_ "), to as promptly as practicable supply any additional information and documentary material that may be requested by CFIUS, and to take all other reasonably necessary, proper or advisable steps to seek expeditious conclusion of the CFIUS review process. In connection with any decision to make a voluntary filing and any subsequent CFIUS review process, each of Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any inquiries, (ii) to the extent not prohibited by a Governmental Entity, promptly inform the other party of any communication and supply to the other party any written communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, CFIUS or any other Governmental Entity, and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, CFIUS or any other Governmental Entity, and to the extent permissible, give the other party the opportunity to participate in such meetings and conferences. The parties hereto agree to take any action necessary to (A) address any objections concerning national security raised in the course of the CFIUS review process by CFIUS or any other Governmental Entity, and (B) if necessary in order to address any such objections, mitigate the concerns raised, provided that Parent and Purchaser shall not be obligated to take or proffer to take any of the foregoing actions if such actions would be reasonably likely in the aggregate to have (x) a material adverse effect on the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) a Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall determine whether to make a filing for CFIUS review pursuant to this Section 6.6(h), and notify the Company thereof, (I) at any time prior to the later of July 1, 2008 and the commencement of the Offer, or (II) at any time thereafter, but, in the case

  of this clause (II) only if, based on a communication from a Governmental
Entity, Parent reasonably believes that there is a substantial risk that, in
the absence of a voluntary notification, CFIUS may (before or after the
completion of the Offer) commence a review of the transaction under the Exon-
Florio Amendment.

 

 SECTION 6.7. _Takeover Laws_. The parties shall take all reasonable steps to exclude the applicability to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby of any Takeover Laws, and the Company shall, at the Parents request and expense, provide reasonable assistance in any challenge by Parent or Purchaser to the validity, or the applicability to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, of any Takeover Laws.

 

 SECTION 6.8. _Information Statement_. Unless the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as contemplated by Section 2.7, as soon as practicable after the consummation of the Offer, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Information Statement in preliminary form as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Company shall obtain and furnish the information required to be included in the Information Statement, shall provide Parent and Purchaser with, and consult with Parent and Purchaser regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, shall respond as promptly as practicable to any such comments made by the SEC or its staff with respect to the Information Statement, and shall cause the Information Statement in definitive form to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the SEC or its staff advises the Company that it has no further comments on the Information Statement. Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Information Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto and shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Information Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto prior to any filing thereof with the SEC or any mailing thereof to the Companys stockholders. If at any time prior to the Closing, any information relating to the Offer, the Merger, the Company, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Information Statement, so that the Information Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed as promptly as practicable with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

 

 SECTION 6.9. _Conduct by Parent Pending the Merger_. Parent agrees with the Company that, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to: (i) enter into or consummate any agreements or arrangements for an acquisition (via stock purchase, merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or otherwise) of any ownership interest or assets of any Person if such ownership interest or assets would reasonably be expected to result in any material delay in obtaining, or to result in the failure to obtain, any approval of any Governmental Entity required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) take or agree to take any other action (including entering into agreements with respect to any equity investments, joint ventures, acquisitions, mergers, 

  consolidations or business combinations) which would reasonably be expected to
result in any material delay in obtaining, or which would reasonably be
expected to result in the failure to obtain, any approvals of any Governmental
Entity required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, or
which would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the commencement or consummation of the Offer or the consummation of the
Merger or otherwise result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) acquire beneficial ownership (as defined in
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of any Shares in violation of Rule 14e-5
under the Exchange Act.

 

 SECTION 6.10. _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Change of Board Recommendation or any action taken by the Company or the Company Board pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 6.3, the Company and Parent will consult with and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such release or make such announcement prior to such consultation except as may be required by applicable Law or any rule or regulation of Nasdaq or any other stock exchange to which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated.

 

 SECTION 6.11. _Notification_. The Company shall give reasonably prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give reasonably prompt notice to the Company, upon obtaining knowledge of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, which would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any Offer Condition. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter or otherwise limit or otherwise affect the rights or remedies available hereunder to any party receiving such notice; _provided_ that any failure to so notify shall not be a breach of this Agreement by the Company or Parent unless the failure to so advise would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, respectively.

 

 SECTION 6.12. _Financing_. (a) After the date hereof the Parent may add to or replace the Existing Debt Financing Commitments with additional or replacement debt commitments (the " _New Debt Financing Commitments_ ," and together with Existing Debt Financing Commitments, the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which such lenders party thereto have committed, subject to terms thereof, to provide or cause to be provided the amounts set forth therein (the " _New Debt Financing_ ," and together with the Existing Debt Financing, the " _Debt Financing_ ") or equity financing commitments (the " _New Equity Financing_ _Commitments_ ," and together with the Debt Financing Commitments, the " _Financing_ _Commitments_ "), pursuant to which such parties have committed, subject to the terms thereof, to invest the cash amounts set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ ," and together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). Parent shall as promptly as practicable deliver to the Company true and complete copies of any commitment letters executed after the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall agree to or permit any replacement of, or amendment, supplement or other modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Financing Commitments if such replacement, amendment, supplement, modification, waiver or remedy, would result in the amount available thereunder, together with Parents available cash, cash equivalents, fully committed and available lines of credit and definitive financing commitments, being less than the aggregate amount that is 

  required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, adversely amends
or expands the conditions to drawdown the Financing in any respect that would
make such conditions materially less likely to be satisfied, that would
reasonably be expected to delay the Purchase Time or the Effective Time, or is
materially adverse to the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole prior to the Effective Time. Parent and Purchaser shall keep the
Company reasonably apprised of material developments relating to the
Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, failure to obtain all or any portion of
the Financing shall not in and of itself relieve or alter the obligations of
Parent and Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the respective officers, employees and advisors, including legal and accounting, of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and Purchaser reasonable cooperation reasonably requested in writing by Parent that is reasonably necessary or customary in connection with the Financing ( _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to assist with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, bank information memoranda and similar documents necessary or customary in connection with the Financing, (including using commercially reasonable efforts to assist with the preparation of a bank information memorandum related to the Existing Debt Financing Commitment from Bank of America, N.A. and Banc of America Securities LLC providing for $350 million of senior facilities for certain of the Companys Subsidiaries, twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date), (iii) providing Parent or Parent\'s representatives with (A) unaudited consolidated balance sheets, and related statements of income and cash flow of the Company, for each month and fiscal quarter of the current fiscal year in each case ended at least forty-five (45) days before the Closing Date to the extent not received prior to the date hereof, which balance sheet and statement of income shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP (without the requirement of footnote disclosures), and (B) consolidating financial information on a subsidiary or divisional basis, in each case with the same level of detail and in the same form as currently provided under the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of April 14, 2006, among Superior Essex Communications LP and Essex Group, Inc., as borrowers (the "Existing ABL Borrowers"), Bank of America, N.A. as agent, General Electric Capital Corporation, as syndication agent, Banc of America Securities LLC and GECC Capital Markets, Inc., as co-lead arrangers, and certain financial institutions as lenders party thereto from time to time (as amended to the date hereof, the "Existing ABL Loan Agreement"), (iv) assisting Parent or Parents representatives in preparing (A) with the same level of detail and in the same form as currently provided by the Existing ABL Borrowers under the Existing ABL Loan Agreement, a pro forma consolidated and consolidating balance sheet of the Company as of the date of the most recent consolidated balance sheet delivered pursuant to the preceding clause (iii) and a pro forma consolidated and consolidating statement of operations for the most recent fiscal year, interim period (if available) and 12-month period ending on the last day of such interim period (if available), in each case adjusted to give effect to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the other transactions related thereto and any other transactions that would be required to be given pro forma effect by Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 and (B) a financial model of the Existing ABL Borrowers and Essex Group Canada, Inc. to 

  include projected financial performance (including balance sheet and
availability projections and debt tranches) on a monthly basis for the first
loan year and on an annual basis thereafter, (v) using commercially reasonable
efforts, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, to permit the
prospective lenders and investors involved in the Financing to evaluate the
Companys current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and
procedures relating thereto during normal business hours and with reasonable
advance notice for the purposes of establishing collateral arrangements in
each case only the extent necessary to consummate the Financing; _provided_
that none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay
any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other cost or expense that is
not simultaneously reimbursed by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out of pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection
with such cooperation and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, expenses, interest, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than information provided by the Company or the Subsidiaries in accordance
with the terms hereof). For the avoidance of doubt, the Companys obligations
in this Section 6.12(b) are limited to reasonable cooperation, and obtaining
the Financing shall not in any event be deemed to be the responsibility of the
Company.

 

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, nothing herein shall obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver a notice of redemption with respect to the Notes prior to the Purchase Time.

 

 (d) In the event that at any time upon or following the Purchase Date, the amount of funds available to be borrowed (whether then drawn or undrawn) pursuant to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated as of April 14, 2006 (as amended, the " _Revolving Credit Agreement_ ") among Superior Essex Communications LP, Essex Group, Inc., the lenders party thereto from time to time, and Bank of America, N.A. is less than $75 million as a result of the occurrence of the transactions contemplated herein (including as a result of a default or a failure of a condition to borrowing, in each case, caused thereby), Parent shall make available to the Company and its Subsidiaries a revolving credit facility in the amount of $75 million less any amount then available to be borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement, on substantially the same terms as the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain an amendment or waiver from the requisite lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement to permit the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Credit_ _Agreement Amendment_ "); provided that (a) the Credit Agreement Amendment shall be effective only as of the Purchase Date or thereafter and (b) no fee or other payment in respect of the Credit Agreement Amendment shall be due and payable to the agent or lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement at any time prior to the Purchase Date.

 

 (e) Parent and Purchaser shall use, and shall cause its Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Financing as promptly as practicable, on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and finalize definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein or on other terms no less favorable to Parent and Purchaser, (ii) satisfy on a 

  timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent or Purchaser in such
definitive agreements, (iii) comply with their obligations under the Financing
Commitments and consummate the Financing no later than the Purchase Date or
the Closing Date (as applicable) and (iv) enforce its rights under the
Financing Commitments. In the event that all conditions to the Financing
Commitments (other than in connection with the Debt Financing, the
availability or funding of any of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied in
Parents good faith judgment, Parent and Purchaser shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons providing such
Financing to fund the Financing required to consummate the Share purchase
described in Section 1.1 hereof on the Purchase Date and to consummate the
Closing on the Closing Date (including by taking enforcement action to cause
such lenders and other Persons providing such Financing to fund such
Financing). In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Financing Commitments, Parent
shall promptly notify the Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources on terms that
will still enable Parent and Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, but no later than the Outside Date. Parent shall
deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to
which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent with
any portion of the Financing. Parent and Purchaser shall refrain (and shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause their Affiliates to refrain) from
taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected
to result in a failure of any of the conditions contained in the Financing
Commitments or in any definitive agreement related to the Financing.

 

 SECTION 6.13. _Dispositions_. Prior to the Purchase Time, Parent and the Company shall take all such actions as may be required (if any) to cause any dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with the SEC staff No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 with respect to such subject.

 

 SECTION 6.14. _Treatment of Series A Preferred Stock_. Pursuant to the terms of the Superior Essex Holding Corp. Certificate of Designation of Series A Preferred Stock (the " _Certificate of Designation_ ") the Company shall give holders of the Series A Preferred Stock notice that a change of control, as defined in the Certificate of Designation, will occur upon consummation of the Offer. The notice shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent. At the Purchase Time the Company shall redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designation.

 

 SECTION 6.15. _Treatment of Certain Notes_. (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to commence, as soon as reasonably practicable after the receipt of a written request from Parent to do so, one or more offers to purchase, and related consent solicitations with respect to, all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the notes identified in Section 6.15 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Notes_ ") on the terms and conditions specified by Parent and (except as to the offer price) reasonably acceptable to the Company (collectively, the " _Debt Offers_ "); _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to commence any Debt Offers until Parent shall

  have provided the Company with the necessary offer to purchase, related letter
of transmittal, supplemental indenture and other related documents
(collectively, the " _Debt Offer Documents_ "). The terms and conditions
specified by Parent for the Debt Offers shall be only such terms and such
conditions as are customarily included in offers to purchase debt securities
similar to the Notes and otherwise in compliance with applicable Laws. The
closing of the Debt Offers shall be expressly conditioned on the completion of
the Merger and shall be conducted in compliance with applicable Laws,
including SEC rules and regulations. None of the Notes shall be required to be
purchased, whether or not such repurchase is at option of the Company or at
the request of Parent, prior to the Effective Time. The Company and Parent
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, and shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective Representatives to,
provide cooperation and assistance reasonably requested by the other in
connection with the Debt Offers.

 

 (b) Following the commencement of the Debt Offers, Company shall not make any change to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offers or related consent solicitation, unless such change is previously approved by the Parent in writing.

 

 (c) Subject to Section 6.15(a), the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offers (other than that the Merger shall have been consummated and that there shall be no Law, injunction or other legal restraint prohibiting consummation of the Debt Offers) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and shall not, without the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offers or make any changes to the Debt Offers other than as agreed in writing between Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to make any change to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offers requested by Parent that decreases the price per Note payable in the Debt Offers or related consent solicitation as set forth in the Debt Offer Documents as of the commencement of each Debt Offer or imposes conditions to the Debt Offers or related consent solicitation in addition to those set forth in the Debt Offer Documents as of the commencement of each Debt Offer that are adverse to the holders of the Notes, unless such change is previously approved by the Company in writing.

 

 (d) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the consent solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consents are received, each of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries as is necessary shall (and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable trustee to) execute supplemental indentures to the indentures governing each series of Notes for which the requisite consent has been received, which supplemental indentures shall implement the amendments described in the Debt Offer Documents and shall become operative only concurrently with the consummation of the Debt Offers. Concurrently with the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, upon receipt of a written request from Parent, accept for payment and thereafter promptly pay for the Notes that have been properly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Debt Offers and in accordance with the Debt Offers using funds loaned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries bearing interest at the rate borne by the Notes.

 

 (e) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Offers, including the Debt Offer Documents. Parent and the Company 

  shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate
with each other in the preparation of the Debt Offer Documents (including all
amendments and supplements proposed by Parent). The Debt Offer Documents
(including all amendments or supplements thereto) and all mailings to the
holders of the Notes in connection with the Debt Offers shall be subject to
the prior review of, and comment by, the Company and Parent and shall be
reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion
of the Debt Offers, any information should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Debt
Offer Documents, so that the Debt Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
prepared by Parent describing such information shall be disseminated by or on
behalf of Company to the holders of the applicable Notes (which supplement or
amendment and dissemination may, at the reasonable direction of Parent, take
the form of a filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 6.15(e), the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-l under
the Exchange Act and any other applicable Law to the extent such Laws are
applicable in connection with the Debt Offers and such compliance will not be
deemed a breach hereof.

 

 (f) In connection with the Debt Offers, Parent may select one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and other agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements with such parties so selected. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to reasonably cooperate with such parties so selected. Parent shall pay the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection with the Debt Offers upon the incurrence of such fees and out-of-pocket expenses, and Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company and their Subsidiaries for all of their reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt Offers promptly following the incurrence thereof. In the event that Parent requests that the Company commence one or more Debt Offers pursuant to this Section 6.15, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective officers, directors and each Person that controls the Company within the meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange Act (each a " _Company_ _Person_ ") from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties (excluding the out-of-pocket costs and expenses referred to in the immediately preceding sentence) suffered or incurred by any Company Person, or to which any Company Person may become subject, that arises out of, or in any way in connection with, the Debt Offers, or any actions taken, or not taken by Company, or at the direction of Company, pursuant to this Section 6.15 or at the request of Purchaser or Parent. The Company shall be deemed to have satisfied each of its obligations set forth in this Section 6.15 if the Company shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such obligations, regardless of the actual outcome of the Debt Offer.

  (g) If, prior to the Purchase Time, this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VIII, the Company shall promptly terminate the Debt Offers without purchasing any Notes and shall return the Notes tendered promptly after such termination.

 

 SECTION 6.16. _Real Estate Matters_. (a) Parent, at its own discretion and sole expense, may order preliminary title reports from a nationally recognized title company (the " _Title Company_ ") with respect to any of the real property (the property covered by such reports being referred to herein as the " _Titled Property_ "). The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts in cooperating with Parent and the Title Company in connection with the compilation, review and examination of title to the Titled Property and in connection with Purchasers efforts to obtain title insurance policies pursuant thereto on behalf of itself and/or its lender, including, by providing on the Purchase Date customary affidavits (provided that such affidavits shall be based on the actual knowledge of the signatory without personal liability to such signatory), and corporate indemnities as are reasonably required by the Title Company for the deletion of any standard or printed exceptions reasonably required to be deleted by any lender that is insured under such title insurance policies.

 

 (b) All premiums, fees, costs and expenses in connection with the Companys compliance with this Section 6.16, including fees charged by the Title Company for any such title reports or title insurance policies, shall be borne wholly by Parent. The obligation of Parent to reimburse the Company and it Subsidiaries for such fees, costs and expenses shall survive the Closing or any termination of this Agreement.

 

 SECTION 6.17. _Approval of Compensation Actions_. The Compensation Committee of the Company Board has taken, or prior to June 30, 2008, shall take, all such actions as may be required to approve, as an employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto (i) the grant by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any present or former director, officer or employee of any increase in compensation or benefits in any form or of the right to receive any severance or termination compensation or benefit, or any approval, amendment or modification of any such grant; or (ii) the entry by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries into any employment, consulting, indemnification, termination, change of control, non-competition or severance agreement or arrangement with any present or former director, officer or employee, or any approval, amendment or modification of any such agreement or arrangement; or (iii) the approval, amendment to or adoption of any Company Plan.

 SECTION 9.6. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto) any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement except Section 6.5 and, following the Purchase Time, the provisions of Sections 3.2, and, following the Effective Time, the provisions of Section 3.1.

 SECTION 9.7. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the choice of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  SECTION 9.9. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

 SECTION 9.10. _Specific Performance; Jurisdiction_. (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder (whether brought by the parties hereto or any other Person), (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (iii) except as provided in the last sentence of this Section 9.10(a), agrees that it will not bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state court within the State of Delaware) or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (a) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (b) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Laws, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject mater hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent agrees that if the Company or any other Person obtains against Parent a judgment of a Delaware state or federal court relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company or such Person, respectively, may bring an action with respect to the recognition and enforcement thereof in a court in Korea, and Parent irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, any contention that such judgment of a Delaware state or federal court may not be recognized and/or enforced in whole or in part.

 

 (b) Each of Parent and Purchaser hereby irrevocably designates CT Corporation System (in such capacity, the " _Process Agent_ "), with an office at 111 Eighth 

  Avenue New York, NY 10011 as its designee, appointee and agent to receive, for
and on its behalf service of process in such jurisdiction in any legal action
or proceedings with respect to this agreement or any other agreement executed
in connection with this agreement, and such service shall be deemed complete
upon delivery thereof to the process agent; _provided_ that in the case of any
such service upon the process agent, the party effecting such service shall
also deliver a copy thereof to each of Parent and Purchaser in the manner
provided in Section 9.2 of this Agreement. Each of Parent and Purchaser shall
take all such action as may be necessary to continue said appointment in full
force and effect or to appoint another agent so that each of Parent and
Purchaser will at all times have an agent for service of process for the above
purposes in New York, NY. In the event of the transfer of all or substantially
all of the assets and business of the Process Agent to any other entity by
consolidation, merger, sale of assets or otherwise, such other entity shall be
substituted hereunder for the process agent with the same effect as if named
herein in place of CT Corporation System. Nothing herein shall affect the
right of any party to serve process in any manner permitted by applicable law.
Each of Parent and Purchaser expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver
is intended to be irrevocable under the laws of the state of Delaware and of
the United States of America.

 

 SECTION 9.11. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

 SECTION 9.12. _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

 _CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_

 

Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ and not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement to which it is
attached (the " _Merger Agreement_ ").

 

 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered in connection with the Offer, unless, immediately prior to the Expiration Date:

 

 (a) there shall have been validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn that number of Shares which, together with the number of Shares, if any, then owned beneficially by Parent and Purchaser (together with their wholly owned Subsidiaries), constitutes at least a majority of the total number of then-outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis (which shall mean, as of any time, the number of Shares outstanding, together with all Shares (if any) which the Company would be required to issue, after giving effect to Sections 3.2(a) and 3.2(b), pursuant to any then outstanding warrants, options, benefit plans or obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable into Shares or otherwise, whether or not then exercisable) (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_");

 

 (b) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have expired or been terminated, and any required approvals or consents in respect of the Offer shall have been obtained under any applicable Antitrust Laws of Germany and Spain and China (and any applicable waiting periods thereunder have expired or been terminated); and

 

 (c) if, in accordance with the Merger Agreement, Parent and the Company have filed notification of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the Exon-Florio Amendment, the period of time for any applicable review process by CFIUS relating to the determination of any threat to national security in respect of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the Exon-Florio Amendment shall have expired, the President of the United States shall not have taken action to block or prevent the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, and no requirements or conditions to mitigate any national security concerns have been imposed that would reasonably be expected to have an effect referred to in the last sentence of Section 6.6(e) of the Merger Agreement.

 

 2. Additionally, notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the termination or

  withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered in connection with
the Offer if any of the following conditions exist:

 

 (a) there shall be any Law, decree, judgment, order or injunction promulgated, enacted, entered, enforced, issued or amended after the date hereof by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction that (i) enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; or (ii) imposes material limitations on the ability of Parent or Purchaser to exercise voting rights over all Shares acquired in the Offer sufficient to consummate the Merger, _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt that the failure to obtain a clearance or approval under any Antitrust Law other than those of the countries listed in 1(b) of these Conditions shall not be deemed a Law, decree, judgment, order or injunction for purposes of this Section 2(a)(ii);

 

 (b) (i) the Company shall have failed to comply in all material respects with its obligations, covenants, or agreements under the Merger Agreement to be performed or complied with by it prior to the Expiration Date and such failure to perform shall not have been cured prior to the Expiration Date or

 

 (ii) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement shall not be true and correct; _provided_ , that, for purposes of this Paragraph 2(b):

 

 (A) all such representations and warranties (other than the representation and warranty contained in Section 4.8(b) of the Merger Agreement) shall be interpreted without giving effect to the words "materially" or "material" or to any qualification using such terms or using the defined term "Material Adverse Effect";

 

 (B) any such representation or warranty contained in Section 4.3 of the Merger Agreement with respect to the number of equity securities outstanding or issuable shall be deemed untrue if it shall fail to be true and correct in all but _de minimis_ respects, and any such representation or warranty contained in Section 4.8(b) of the Merger Agreement shall be deemed untrue if it shall fail to be true and correct in all respects; and

 

 (C) any such representation or warranty (other than any representation or warranty referred to in clause B above) shall be deemed true and correct unless the failure of all such representations and warranties to be true and correct has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;

 

in each case at any Expiration Date (except for any representation or warranty
that is expressly made as of a specified date, in which case as of such
specified date); or

  (c) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms or shall have been amended pursuant to its terms to provide for such termination or amendment of the Offer;

 

which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or Purchaser, in any case, makes
it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or with acceptance for payment or
payment for Shares.

 

Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the conditions set forth in
Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this _Exhibit A_ are for the benefit of Purchaser and,
regardless of the circumstances, may be asserted by Purchaser in whole or in
part at any applicable time or from time to time prior to the Expiration Date,
except that the conditions relating to receipt of any approvals from any
Governmental Entity may be asserted at any time prior to the acceptance for
payment of Shares, and all conditions (except for the Minimum Tender
Condition, which may only be waived with the prior written consent of the
Company) may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in its discretion in whole or in
part at any applicable time or from time to time, in each case subject to the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure of Parent or
Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
