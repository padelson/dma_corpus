effective as of the Closing, in the absence of fraud by EPC, the Seller or the Company (to the
extent determined by a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Buyer, on behalf
of itself and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties, waives any rights and claims any Buyer
Indemnified Party may have against the Seller, whether in law or equity, in contract or in tort,
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries and/or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The rights and claims waived by the Buyer, on behalf of itself and the other Buyer Indemnified
Parties, include claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to
any Environmental Laws, claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty,
negligent misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty. After the Closing, subject to
the foregoing, this Article&nbsp;VIII will provide the exclusive remedy against the Seller for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that nothing in this Section&nbsp;8.6
shall limit either party&#146;s right to claim or bring an Action against the other party based on fraud
of the other party and equitable remedies consisting of specific performance or injunctive relief
in respect of any breach of any covenant or agreement to be performed after Closing. The Seller has
specifically relied on this Section&nbsp;8.6, together with Section&nbsp;8.5 and the other provisions of this
Article&nbsp;VIII and Section&nbsp;10.17 in agreeing to the Purchase Price and in agreeing to provide the
specific representations and warranties set forth herein.
