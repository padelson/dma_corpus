 (d) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as follows: 

  

 (i) if the Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.5 exceeds the Reference Amount by at least $1,000,000, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to such excess, and the Buyer shall pay such amount to the Seller; and 

   #####

 (e) Amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.5(d) shall bear interest from the Closing Date to the date of such payment at a rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by J.P. Morgan Chase and Co. as its prime rate, calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed. Payments in respect of Section 2.5(d) shall be made within three Business Days of final determination of the Closing Working Capital pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.5 by wire transfer of United States dollars in immediately available funds to such account or accounts as may be designated in writing by the party entitled to such payment at least two Business Days prior to such payment date.

 Section 2.6 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The sale and purchase of the Equity Interests shall be treated for United States federal and state income tax purposes as the sale and purchase of the assets of the Company and no party hereto or any Affiliate thereof shall take any position inconsistent with such treatment. The Seller and the Buyer agree that the final Purchase Price (and any assumed liabilities as determined for United States federal income tax purposes) will be allocated among the assets of the Company for all United States Tax purposes in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. No later than one-hundred and twenty (120) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller for the Sellers review and approval, a copy of the Form 8594 and any required exhibits thereto (the " _Asset Acquisition Statement_ ") allocating the final Purchase Price (and any assumed liabilities as determined for United States federal income tax purposes) among the Companys assets. The Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller, from time to time, for the Sellers review and approval revised copies of the Asset Acquisition Statement (the " _Revised Statements_ ") so as to reflect any matters on the Asset Acquisition Statement that need updating (including purchase price adjustments, if any). If the Buyer and the Seller agree on the allocation of the final Purchase Price (and any assumed liabilities as determined for United States federal income tax purposes) within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Asset Acquisition 

   ##### 

  

 

Statement or the Revised Statements, as the case may be (which shall be
evidenced by an Asset Acquisition Statement or the Revised Statements signed
by each of the Buyer and the Seller), the Buyer, the Seller and their
Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns and information reports in a manner
consistent with such agreed allocation and shall take no position inconsistent
therewith. In the event that the Buyer and the Seller are unable to agree on
such allocation within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Asset
Acquisition Statement or the Revised Statements, as the case may be, such
disagreement shall be referred to the Independent Accounting Firm in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.5(c). The decision of
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be binding on the parties and the
Buyer, the Seller and their Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns and
information reports in a manner consistent with such agreed allocation and
shall take no position inconsistent therewith unless otherwise required by
Law.

   ##### 

  

 

domestic, currently effective or terminated) and any trust, escrow, or similar
agreement related thereto, whether or not funded, in respect of any present
or former employees, directors, officers, shareholders, consultants, or
independent contractors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that (i)
are sponsored or maintained by the Company, (ii) are sponsored or maintained
by or on behalf of a member of the Controlled Group of the Company or (iii)
with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made or is
required to make payments, transfers, or contributions (all of the above
being hereinafter individually or collectively referred to as an " _Employee
Plan_ " or " _Employee Plans_ ," respectively). Schedule 4.10(a) of
the Disclosure Schedules separately identifies each Employee Plan that is
sponsored, maintained or entered into solely by the Company or its
Subsidiaries (and not by EPC or its other Affiliates) (each, a " _Company
Employee Plan_ "), and each Employee Plan that is not a Company Employee Plan
(each, a " _Non-Company Employee Plan_ "). 

   

 (b) Copies of the following materials have been delivered or made available to the Buyer: (i) all plan documents for each Employee Plan or, in the case of an unwritten Employee Plan, a written description thereof, (ii) all determination or opinion letters from the IRS with respect to any of the Employee Plans, (iii) all summary plan descriptions, summaries of material modifications, annual reports, and summary annual reports with respect to any of the Employee Plans, and (iv) all trust agreements, insurance contracts, and other documents relating to the funding or payment of benefits under any Employee Plan. 

  

 (c) Each Employee Plan is being and has been maintained in all material respects in accordance with its terms, any applicable collective bargaining agreement and the requirements of all applicable Law. The Company has performed all material obligations required to be performed by it under any Employee Plan and is not in any material respect in default under or in violation of any Employee Plan. No Action (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) or investigation is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened (i) with respect to any Employee Plan that could result in liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (ii) with respect to any Company Employee Plan. There have been no prohibited transactions or breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the Employee Plans that could result in any material liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries. 

  

 (d) Each Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has been either determined by the IRS to be so qualified or submitted for such determination, and each trust created thereunder has been determined by the IRS to be exempt from tax under the provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of any such determination that could reasonably be expected to give the IRS grounds to revoke such determination. 

  

 (e) Neither the Company nor any member of the Controlled Group currently has, and at no time since August 1, 2006 has had, an obligation to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of the Code or a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 210(a) of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code. Any liability under Title IV of ERISA that the Company or any member of its Controlled Group 

   ##### 

  

 

has incurred with respect to any "multiemployer plan" or "multiple employer
plan" has been satisfied in full. 

   

 (f) Neither the Company nor any member of the Controlled Group has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than for premiums pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA which have been timely paid) or Section 4971 of the Code, and no condition exists that presents a risk to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of incurring any such liability or failure. Each Employee Plan to which Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA applies has satisfied the requirements of Sections 412, 430 and 436 of the Code and Sections 302 and 303 of ERISA. Schedule 4.10(f) of the Disclosure Schedules identifies the funded status of each EPT Pension Plan for financial accounting purposes (on a FAS 158 basis) as of October 31, 2009. No EPT Pension Plan currently is in "at-risk status" within the meaning of Section 430(i)(4) of the Code or Section 303(i)(4) of ERISA or currently subject to the limitations of Section 436 of the Code. No Employee Plan has or has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, nor has any waiver of the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code been requested of or granted by the IRS with respect to any Employee Plan, nor has any lien in favor of any Employee Plan arisen under Section 412(n) or 430(k) of the Code or Section 302(f) or 303(k) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any member of the Controlled Group has been required to provide security to any defined benefit pension plan pursuant to Section 412(c)(4) or 436 of the Code or Section 306 or 307 of ERISA. There has been no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations and interpretations thereunder which has not been fully and accurately reported in a timely fashion, as required, or which, whether or not reported, would to the Knowledge of the Company reasonably be expected to constitute grounds for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to institute termination proceedings with respect to any Employee Plan.

 (b) From and after the Closing, the Seller will not, directly or indirectly, for a period of two years thereafter, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, solicit (other than a solicitation by general advertisement not specifically targeted at any such person) any person who is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate his or her employment with the Company or such Subsidiary, or hire any such person, provided that this restriction shall not apply to any individuals who are no longer employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

EaglePicher Technologies Salaried Pension Plan and the EaglePicher
Technologies Hourly Pension Plan shall be transferred to the Company Trust in
cash. The assets of the EaglePicher Salaried and Closed Hourly Pension Plan

Trust in cash unless Buyer notifies Seller in writing no later than twenty
(20) days prior to the Closing Date, that Buyer desires the assets of both
such plans to be transferred in kind. Buyer shall notify Seller in writing
when the Company Trust has been established and the assets of the EPT Pension
Plans can be transferred to the Company Trust (which notice shall be
delivered no later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date), and the
Seller shall effect such transfer no later than seven (7) days after receipt
of such notice. No later than the earlier of (i) 30 days after the date
hereof or (ii) the Closing Date, the Company shall file or cause to be filed
a notice with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") in full

The Seller shall be responsible for compliance with any and all obligations under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notifications Act of 1988 or under any similar state, local or foreign law, (together with any similar state or local Law, " _WARN_ ") with respect to the Company Employees and Former Company Employees arising prior to the Closing Date. On and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall be responsible, with respect to the Company Employees, for compliance with any and all obligations under WARN. The Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates against or with respect to all Losses of Seller or any of its Affiliates under the WARN Act as a result of the termination by Buyer of any Company Employees employment occurring on or after the Closing Date.

Company Employee involved or impacted by a plant closing, layoff, or
employment loss (as those terms are defined in the WARN Act) in the 120 days
preceding the Closing. 

   

 (g) The Seller shall be responsible for all workers compensation claims and long-term disability (" _LTD_ ") claims of Company Employees and Former Company Employees incurred before the Closing.

Any amounts owed or payable under the EaglePicher 401(k) Restoration Plan and the Eagle Pension Restoration Plan shall be paid at the sole cost and expense of Seller at or promptly following the Closing. 

   

 (i) To the extent Company Employees participate in a dependent care or medical expense reimbursement account under an Employee Plan subject to Section 125 of the Code (" _Seller s Flexible Account Plan_") during the calendar year that includes the Closing, the Buyer or its Affiliates shall establish one or more comparable plans (" _Buyer s Flexible Account Plan_") that will recognize the elections that such Company Employees had in effect for purposes of the plan year in which the Closing occurs under the Sellers Flexible Account Plan. Buyers Flexible Account Plan shall (a) assume the obligations of Sellers Flexible Account Plan with respect to Company Employees as of the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the Closing, (i) if the total amount that Company Employees have contributed to Sellers Flexible Account Plan through the Closing Date for the calendar year that includes the Closing exceeds all amounts that have been paid from Sellers Flexible Account Plan through the Closing Date for medical expense and dependent care claims incurred by the Company Employees in the calendar year that includes the Closing, the Seller shall transfer to the Buyer such excess amount in cash, or (ii) if the total amounts that have been paid from Sellers Flexible Account Plan through the Closing Date for medical expense and dependent care claims incurred by the Company Employees in the calendar year that includes the Closing exceeds the amount that Company Employees have contributed to Sellers Flexible Account Plan through the Closing Date for the calendar year that includes the Closing, the Buyer shall transfer to the Seller such excess amount 

   ##### 

  

   

in cash. After the Closing Date, Buyers Flexible Account Plan will be
responsible for reimbursement of all previously unreimbursed
reimbursable medical expense and dependent care claims incurred by Company
Employees with respect to the calendar year that includes the Closing.

The Buyer and the Seller shall retain all schedules and workpapers and all material records or other documents relating to all Company Employee Plans until the expiration of the statute of limitations for the periods to which such documents relate, and each of the Buyer and the Seller shall maintain such schedules, workpapers, records and documents in the same manner and with the same care it uses in maintaining its schedules, workpapers, records and documents. Each of the Buyer, the Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall give the other parties reasonable written notice prior to destroying or discarding any such books or records that could impact the other partys administration of the Company Employee Plans and, if another party so requests, the other party shall take possession of such books and records. Any information obtained under this Section 6.11(k) shall be kept confidential.

 Section 6.16 _Tax Matters._  

  

 (a) For purposes of this Agreement, the portion of Tax, with respect to the income, property or operations of the Company or the Canadian Subsidiary that is attributable to any Tax period that begins on or before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") will be apportioned between the period of the Straddle Period that extends before the Closing Date through the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ ") and the period of the Straddle Period that extends from the day after the Closing Date to the end of the Straddle Period (the " _Post-Closing Straddle Period_ ") in accordance with this Section 6.16(a). The portion of such Tax attributable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period will (i) in the case of any Taxes other than sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any sales or use taxes, value-added taxes, employment taxes, withholding taxes, and any Tax based on or measured by income, receipts or profits earned during a Straddle Period, be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included the Closing Date. The portion of Tax attributable to a Post-Closing Straddle Period shall be calculated in a corresponding manner. To the extent that any Tax for a Straddle Period is based on the greater of a Tax on net income, on the one hand, and a Tax measured by net worth or some other basis not otherwise measured by income, on the other hand, the portion of such Tax related to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period 

    ##### 

  

    

and the Post-Closing Straddle Period will be determined based on the
foregoing and based on the manner in which the actual Tax liability for the
entire Straddle Period is determined. In the case of a Tax that is (i) paid
for the privilege of doing business during a period (a " _Privilege Period_
") and (ii) computed based on business activity occurring during an
accounting period ending prior to such Privilege Period, any reference to a
"Tax period," a "tax period," or a "taxable period" shall mean
such accounting period and not such Privilege Period. 

   

 (b) The Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are due with respect to any Straddle Period or Pre-Closing Tax Period other than Returns for which the due date (with applicable extensions) falls on or before the Closing Date. All such Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice, except to the extent required by applicable Law, and shall be subject to the prior review and approval of the Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries shown as due and owing on such Tax Returns subject to reimbursement by the Seller pursuant to Section 8.2(a) hereof. 

   

 (c) In connection with the preparation and filing of Returns, audit examinations, obtaining tax clearance certificates in connection with transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to any Tax liabilities imposed on the Buyer, the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Buyer and the Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries including, but not limited to, during normal business hours, the furnishing or making available of books and records, personnel (as reasonably required and at no cost to the other party) or other materials necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Returns, the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims by governmental authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. The Buyer and the Seller shall retain all Returns, schedules and workpapers and all material records or other documents relating to all Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for the Tax period first ending after the Closing Date and for all prior Tax periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the Tax periods to which such Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extension, except to the extent notified by another party in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax periods, or (ii) seven years following the due date (without extension) for such Returns, and each of the Buyer and the Seller shall maintain such Returns, schedules, workpapers, records and documents in the same manner and with the same care it uses in maintaining its Returns, schedules, workpapers, records and documents. Each of the Buyer, the Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall give the other parties reasonable written notice prior to destroying or discarding any such books or records and, if another party so requests, the other party shall take possession of such books and records. Any information obtained under this Section 6.16(c) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding. 

   

 (d) Subject to this Section 6.16, the Buyer has the right to represent the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries before the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to any inquiry, assessment, proceeding or other similar event relating to Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (a " _Tax Matter_ ") and has the right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such Tax Matter, including responding to 

   ##### 

  

 

inquiries, filing Returns and contesting, defending against and resolving any
assessment for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other
adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to, such Tax Matter. If the Seller would
be required to indemnify the Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) of this Agreement with respect to such Tax Matter
then: (i) the Seller has the right (but not the duty) to participate in the
defense of such Tax Matter and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from counsel employed by the Buyer, and (ii) the Buyer shall not
enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Tax Matter to
the extent that it adversely affects the Tax liability or indemnification
obligations of the Seller without the prior written consent of the Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. 

   

 (e) The Buyer will provide notice to the Seller of any inquiries made by, discussions with or representations or submissions proposed to be made to any Governmental Authority to the extent that the subject matter thereof relates to the Company or its Subsidiaries and relates to representations, covenants or obligations of the Seller hereunder or could reasonably give rise to a right of indemnity hereunder. The Buyer will forthwith advise the Seller of the substance of any such inquiries or discussions and provide the Seller with copies of any written communications from any Governmental Authority relating to such inquiries or discussions. The Buyer will provide the Seller a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such representations or submissions and to attend any meeting with any such Governmental Authority with respect to such matters. 

   

 (f) The Buyer will provide the reasonable assistance of the employees or personnel of the Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries and the accounting and legal and other representatives and advisors of the Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries and otherwise take such reasonable steps to cooperate with the Seller and render all reasonable assistance, as the Seller may reasonably request (including, to the extent requested by the Seller, dealing directly with any Governmental Authority in relation to audits, inquiries, discussions or disputes), with respect to all matters relating to any inquires, discussions or disputes where the subject matter thereof relates to representations, covenants or obligations of the Seller hereunder or could reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnity hereunder. 

   

 (g) The Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries will, upon reasonable request of the Seller, use all reasonable commercial efforts to take reasonable steps, including obtaining any certificate or other document from, or effect any filing with, any Governmental Authority as may be considered desirable to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Taxes that could be imposed on the Company or its Subsidiaries and that could reasonably give rise to a right of indemnity hereunder, provided that the Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries will not be required to expend more than nominal amounts of money to effect same, unless their reasonable costs of doing so are reimbursed by the Seller. 

   

 (h) The Buyer covenants that it will not, or cause or permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to, take any action on or after the Closing, make any election or deemed election or make or change any Tax election, amend any Tax Return or take any position on any Tax Return that results in any increased Tax liability or reduction of any deduction, credit or loss carry-over of the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of any period ending on or before, or 

     ##### 

  

    

which includes, the Closing Date, unless the Buyer agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates against any such Tax. 

   

 (i) The Buyer shall promptly pay to the Seller any refunds of Taxes paid with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries attributable to any periods ending on or before or which include the Closing Date (plus any interest received with respect thereto from any applicable Taxation Authority) to the extent not shown or reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet. 

   

 (j) Upon request of the Seller, the Buyer and the Canadian Subsidiary will effect the election described in subsection 256(9) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) 

   

 Section 6.17 _Insurance Matters._  

  

 (a) From and after the Closing, the Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not require conversion of any claims made policy to an occurrence based policy or acceptance of adverse changes in the existing Insurance Policies of the Seller or its Affiliates), subject to the terms of the Insurance Policies, to retain the right to make claims and receive recoveries, for the benefit of the Company and its Subsidiaries, under any of the Insurance Policies (except to the extent that any such policy provides for coverage only if the policy is in effect at the time such claim is made) maintained at any time prior to the Closing by either the Seller or its Affiliates covering any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense (to the full extent of the existing coverage) relating to the assets, business, operations, conduct, products and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries that relates to or arises out of occurrences prior to the Closing (each, a " _Claim_ "). The Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not require conversion of any claims made policy to an occurrence based policy or acceptance of adverse changes in the existing Insurance Policies of the Seller or its Affiliates) so that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have the right, power and authority to (i) make directly any Claims under the Insurance Policies, (ii) control the administration of any such Claims in accordance with the terms of the Insurance Policies, (iii) receive directly recoveries thereunder, and (iv) control the prosecution, defense and/or settlement of any litigation or other proceeding by or against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries underlying any such Claims in accordance with the terms of the Insurance Policies. Each of the parties understands and agrees that to the extent that any litigation or other proceeding underlying a Claim is by or against the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries), the Seller shall retain the right, power and authority to (i) make directly any Claims under the Insurance Policies, (ii) control the administration of any such Claims in accordance with the terms of the Insurance Policies, (iii) receive directly recoveries thereunder, and (iv) control the prosecution, defense and/or settlement of any litigation or other proceeding. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that certain of the Insurance Policies are claims made policies and the ability of the Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries to make post-Closing Claims with respect to such claims made policies may be limited by terms of such policies. In addition, from and after the Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to continue to pursue, for the benefit and on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, Claims that are pending under the existing Insurance Policies as of the Closing Date, and Seller shall consult with Buyer with respect to all such matters. 

   ##### 

  

    

 (b) The Buyer agrees, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries promptly, to reimburse, indemnify and hold the Seller and its Affiliates harmless for out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred (including any self-insured loss or deductible amounts paid by the Seller or its Affiliates, any administrative costs and any retrospective premiums imposed on the Seller or its Affiliates to the extent arising from Claims) to carry out any obligations pursuant to this Section 6.17. 

   

 Section 6.18 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification._ 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Buyer covenants, for itself and its successors and assigns, that it and they shall not institute any action or proceeding in any court or before any administrative agency or before any other tribunal against any of the current directors or officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in their capacity as such, with respect to any liabilities, actions or causes of action, judgments, claims or demands of any nature or description (consequential, compensatory, punitive, or otherwise), in each such case solely to the extent resulting from their approval of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) With respect to the Companys and its Subsidiaries directors and officers who will continue in such capacity after the Closing, the Buyer shall not take any action directly or indirectly to disaffirm or adversely affect the provisions of the Companys organizational documents and any other written agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries that provide indemnification of and expense reimbursement to such individuals. 

   

 Section 6.19 _Disposition of Assets_. 

  

 (a) For a period of 24 months after the Closing, the Buyer will not, and will not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its property or assets, other than any such sale, transfer or disposition (a) in the ordinary course of business (including sales of inventory) or (b) that is not, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (ii) make, or agree to make, any dividend or distribution of assets other than dividends and distribution of Cash. 

   

 Section 6.20 _Closing Payments_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Seller or EPC shall, at its sole cost and expense, pay the bonuses and payments described in clause (F) of the definition of "Transaction Expenses" to the individuals entitled thereto. 

  

 Section 6.21 _Software_. The Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense prior to the Closing, transfer to or obtain for the Company, licenses of all Software that is neither (A) owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor (B) licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a license that will remain in effect following the Closing, and is used or held for use in the current conduct of the Business by the Company or its Subsidiaries, which licenses will permit the use of such Software to the same extent and in the same manner as used by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. Within 15 days from the date of this Agreement, the Seller shall provide the Buyer a written list of licenses of Software and Information Systems used or held for use in the current conduct of the Business by the Company or its Subsidiaries that are due to expire or renew within 180 days from the date 

   ##### 

  

 

of this Agreement and the respective dates of such expirations or renewals
and copies of all such licenses. Other than as provided under the Transition
Services Agreement, the Seller shall not be responsible for the payment of
any renewal license fees for licenses on such list with respect to any such
licenses transferred to or obtained for the Company that become due post-
Closing in order to renew such licenses for periods that begin following the
Closing Date. 

   

 Section 6.22 _Bankruptcy Documentation._ Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense prior to the Closing, provide, with respect to the bankruptcy proceedings of EaglePicher Holdings, Inc. in 2005, true, correct and complete copy of the plan of reorganization, as confirmed by the bankruptcy court.

Each of EPC and OMG maintains cash management systems at PNC Bank and agrees to execute such documentation as may be reasonably requested by PNC Bank in order to effect such separation. Such separation is to be effective as of the Business Day immediately following the Closing Date such that the bank accounts of the Company and its Subsidiaries will then operate on a stand-alone basis. After the Closing, if Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) receives any refund or other amount which is an asset of, or is otherwise properly due and owing to, the Company or its Subsidiaries, Seller promptly shall remit, or cause to be remitted, such amount by check to Buyer at the address set forth in Section 10.4 or by wire transfer into an account or accounts of Buyer and/or the Company, as designed in writing by Buyer.

 (a) any breach of any representation or warranty set forth in the Agreement made by the Buyer; and 

   

 (b) any breach of any covenant set forth in this Agreement made by the Buyer or, after the Closing, the Company. 

   

 Section 8.4 _Procedures_. 

  

 (a) In order for a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement as a result of a Loss or a claim or demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim, describing in reasonable detail the facts available to the Indemnified Party giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim (if known) and such other information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure. 

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the 

    ##### 

  

    

commencement of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense thereof at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying
Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the Indemnifying Party has sufficient
financial resources to satisfy the amount of any adverse monetary judgment
that is reasonably likely to result (it being agreed that the Seller shall,
among other reasons, be deemed to have sufficient financial resources as
aforesaid as long as the Escrow Amount is sufficient to satisfy the amount of
the adverse monetary judgments reasonably likely to result from outstanding
Third Party Claim), (ii) the Third Party Claim solely seeks (and continues to
solely seek) monetary damages and (iii) the Indemnifying Party expressly
agrees in writing that as between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be solely obligated to satisfy and
discharge the Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms set forth in
this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses
of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party; _provided_
, that if in the reasonable opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Party,
there is a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the
reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to such Indemnified Party in
connection with such defense. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to employ separate counsel and to participate (but not control) in the
defense thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. The Party that
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim shall promptly inform the other
Party of material developments with respect to such Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent
records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or
under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the Indemnifying Party. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, neither the Indemnifying Party
nor the Indemnified Party shall admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise or discharge,
such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, as applicable. 

   

 (c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim promptly to the Indemnifying Party, describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of computation of the amount of such claim (if known) and such other information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to provide such notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, 

   ##### 

  

   

defense and resolution of such matters and providing legal and business
assistance with respect to such matters. 

   

 (d) The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after the giving of any notice of an indemnification claim pursuant to this Article VIII to provide the Indemnified Party with notice that it disagrees with the amount or method of determination set forth in the notice (the " _Disagreement Notice_ "). If a timely Disagreement Notice is not received or to the extent an item is not objected to in the Disagreement Notice, the claim notice shall be deemed to have been accepted and final and binding on the parties, absent manifest error. If the Indemnifying Party delivers a timely Disagreement Notice, the parties shall resolve such conflict in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 8.4(e) 

   

 (e) If the Indemnifying Party shall have provided a Disagreement Notice, the parties will attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the parties should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement will be prepared and signed by the parties. In the event the parties shall fail to reach an agreement within 30 days after the date on which the Indemnifying Party provided a Disagreement Notice, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.7.

The Buyer shall promptly provide copies to the Seller of all notices, correspondence, draft reports, submissions, work plans, and final reports and shall give the Seller a reasonable opportunity (at the Sellers own expense) to comment on any submissions the Buyer intends to deliver or submit to the appropriate regulatory body prior to said submission provided, however, the Buyer shall not make such submission to the appropriate regulatory body without a prior approval of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or unduly delayed). 

   

 Section 8.5 _Limits on Indemnification_. 

  

 (a) If a claim pursuant to Article VIII relates to a breach by a party of any representation or warranty set forth herein or Section 6.1, it must be received by such party on or prior to the date on which the representation, warranty or covenant on which such claim is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 8.1, in which case such representation, warranty or covenant shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no claim may be asserted against the Seller pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(iv) with respect to Taxes unless written notice of such claim is received by the Seller prior to the expiration of the 30 day period immediately following the expiration of the applicable statute of Tax limitations. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no claim may be asserted against the Seller pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(vii) with respect to the Indemnified Joplin Environmental Conditions 

    ##### 

  

    

unless written notice of such claim is received by the Seller prior to the
date that is 24 months after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no claim may be asserted against the Seller pursuant
to Section 8.2(a)(vi) with respect to Audit Claims unless written notice of
such claim is received by the Seller, prior to the 36 month anniversary of
the Closing Date. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: 

   

 (i) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from the Seller by Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Sections 8.2(a)(i), (ii), (vi) and (vii) shall in no event exceed $20,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ") and the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from the Seller by Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(vi) shall in no event exceed $3,700,000 (the " _Audit Claim Cap_ "); 

  

 (ii) the Seller shall not be liable to any Buyer Indemnified Party for any claim for indemnification under Sections 8.2(a)(i) and (vii) unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from the Seller equals or exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), in which case the Seller shall be liable only for the Losses in excess of the Basket Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such Losses may be claimed by any Buyer Indemnified Party or shall be reimbursable by the Seller or shall be included in calculating the aggregate Losses for purposes of this clause (ii) other than Losses in excess of $10,000 (the " _Minimum Loss Amount_ ") resulting from any single claim or aggregated claims arising out of the same facts, events, or circumstances; _provided_ , _further_ , that this clause (ii) shall not apply to Losses arising out of or relating to the untruth or breach of any representation or warranty made in any Core Representation; 

  

 (iii) the Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss or claim under (x) Section 8.2(a)(vii) to the extent of the specific accrual for such specific Loss as set forth on Schedule 8.5(b)(iii) of the Disclosure Schedules or (y) any other Section in Section 8.2(a) to the extent such Loss or claim was actually included in Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.5. 

  

 (iv) no party hereto shall have any liability under any provision of this Agreement for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special, or indirect damages, including business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or income, or loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement unless such punitive, incidental, consequential, special, or indirect damages are awarded and required to be paid to a third party pursuant to a Law or Order; and 

  

 (v) for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty under this Agreement (other than Section 4.18), such representations and warranties shall be interpreted without giving effect to any limitations or qualifications such as "materiality," "material," "in all material respects," or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth in any such representation or warranty. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) For all purposes of this Article VIII, "Losses" shall be net of (i) any insurance or other recoveries payable to the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification and (ii) any actual reduction in cash Taxes paid by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates directly resulting from the incurrence or payment of any such Losses. 

   

 (d) The Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim, liability, or Loss for which indemnification may be required hereunder. In the event that an Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnifying Party will, upon payment of such indemnity, be subrogated to all of the rights of the Indemnified Party with respect to the claims to which such indemnification relates. 

   

 (e) The Escrow Agreement shall have a two year term and shall contain other customary terms for similar escrows utilized in transactions of this nature, including terms providing that the fees, costs and expenses of the Escrow Agent thereunder, and the indemnification of the Escrow Agent pursuant thereto, shall be borne equally by the Buyer and the Seller. In addition, the Escrow Agreement shall provide that (i) the Escrow Amount and the Audit Escrow Amount shall only be released from the escrow under the Escrow Agreement upon written mutual agreement of Seller and Buyer or pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) any portion of the Escrow Amount and the Audit Escrow Amount in respect of claims made against the Escrow Agreement by a Buyer Indemnified Party in accordance with this Article VIII that are unresolved prior to the 24 month anniversary of the Closing Date shall continue to remain therein until released pursuant to the foregoing clause (i). 

   

 Section 8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, effective as of the Closing, in the absence of fraud by EPC, the Seller or the Company (to the extent determined by a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Buyer, on behalf of itself and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties, waives any rights and claims any Buyer Indemnified Party may have against the Seller, whether in law or equity, in contract or in tort, relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries and/or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The rights and claims waived by the Buyer, on behalf of itself and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties, include claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Laws, claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty. After the Closing, subject to the foregoing, this Article VIII will provide the exclusive remedy against the Seller for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that nothing in this Section 8.6 shall limit either partys right to claim or bring an Action against the other party based on fraud of the other party and equitable remedies consisting of specific performance or injunctive relief in respect of any breach of any covenant or agreement to be performed after Closing. The Seller has specifically relied on this Section 8.6, together with Section 8.5 and the other provisions of this Article VIII and Section 10.17 in agreeing to the Purchase Price and in agreeing to provide the specific representations and warranties set forth herein. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 8.7 _Dispute Resolution_. Each party agrees to submit monetary claims, disputes, controversies, or other matters in question arising out of the matters covered by  _Article VIII_ (" _Disputes_ "), to an independent expert appointed in accordance with this Section 8.7 (the " _Independent Expert_ "), who shall serve as sole mediator for non-binding mediation. The Independent Expert shall be appointed by mutual agreement of the Seller and the Buyer from among candidates with experience and expertise in the area that is the subject of such Dispute. If Disputes to be resolved by the parties with assistance of the Independent Expert are not resolved within 45 days after appointment of the Independent Expert to the satisfaction of either party, then either party shall be entitled to immediately terminate such non-binding mediation and may seek relief in accordance with Article X with respect to such Disputes. The fees and expenses of the Independent Expert shall be borne equally by the parties. For the avoidance of doubt, any Disputes resolved in writing between the Seller and the Buyer within such 45 day period shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder, however, the Independent Expert shall not be authorized to resolve any Disputes between the parties and no determination of the Independent Expert shall resolve any Dispute, be binding on the parties or be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
