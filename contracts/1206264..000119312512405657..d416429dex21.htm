hereto as _Exhibit A_; and

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of Parent and Sub, by unanimous vote of those

this Agreement, (i) determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective companies and stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and

bound, hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the

of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place as soon as possible after,
but in any event no later than the second Business Day after, satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by applicable Law and this Agreement) waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by applicable Law and this Agreement) waiver of
those conditions); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Marketing Period has
not ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and this Agreement) waiver of those
conditions), the Closing shall occur on the date following the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions that is the earliest to occur of (a) a date during

such other date as Parent and the Company may agree in writing; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in no event shall the Closing occur prior to the Written

Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." The Closing shall be held at the offices
of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York

unless another place or time is agreed to by Parent and the Company. Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in such form as
required by, and executed and acknowledged by the parties in accordance with,
the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time (or subsequent date and time) as
Parent and the Company may agree and may specify in the Certificate of Merger
(the date and time the Merger becomes effective being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all claims,
obligations, debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall become

shall be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit
B_, and as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with its
terms and the terms hereof and as provided by applicable Law.

(b) The bylaws of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
applicable Law.

Section 1.6. _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors
and assigns are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death,

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

Section 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or
any holder of any of the securities of the Company or Sub:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.

(i) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (A) shares of Company Common Stock described in
Section 2.1(b) and (B) Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive $2.20 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") payable to the holder
thereof, without interest, in the manner provided in Section 2.3.

(ii) At the Effective Time, all issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (x) a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) (a " _Certificate_ ") or (y)
any shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) that are represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to

 



2  which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.1(a), in each case
without any interest thereon, in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.3, in the case of certificated
shares, and automatically, in the case of Book-Entry Shares.

(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each issued and
outstanding share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the
Company or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. Each issued and outstanding share of Company
Common Stock that is directly owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries of the Company or Parent shall not represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and shall, at the election of Parent, either
(i) convert into shares of a class of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation designated by Parent in connection with the Merger or (ii) be
cancelled.

(c) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock
of Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Treatment of Stock Options; Equity Share Units; RSUs_.

 

(i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding option to

Option Plan for Key Employees Sealy Corporation and its Subsidiaries, the
Amended and Restated Equity Plan for Key Employees of Sealy Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, the Second Amended and Restated Equity Plan for Key

greater than the Merger Consideration to be cancelled without further payment.

(ii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding equity
share unit issued under the Sealy Directors Deferred Compensation Plan (each,

agreement) if applicable, of a given RSU and, the Surviving Corporation shall
pay to each grantee of each such vested RSU, at or promptly after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration for each
such RSU; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything herein to
the 

 



3  contrary, all amounts payable in respect of a RSU will be paid in accordance

") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
at or after the Effective Time, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to
only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or
shall effectively waive, withdraw or lose such stockholders rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, such stockholders Dissenting Shares in respect of
which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive payment under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into

Section 2.1(a)) to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.1(a) (payable without any interest thereon). 

(ii) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and any written withdrawals of
such notices and any other instruments or notices delivered to the Company

shall have the right to direct negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the
right to participate in such negotiations and proceedings. Prior to the

Indenture), each holder of the Convertible Notes, to the extent such holder
has not exercised its right to require the Surviving Corporation to
repurchase such holders Convertible Notes in accordance with the terms of the
Convertible Notes and the Convertible Notes Indenture, will be entitled to
convert such holders Convertible Notes into the right to receive an amount
in cash for each $25.00 principal amount of Convertible Notes held by such
holder as set forth in (and to be calculated in accordance with the terms of)
the Convertible Notes Indenture (such amount, the " _Convertible Note

conversion in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Notes Indenture.

Section 2.3. _Exchange of Shares and Convertible Notes_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Sub shall enter into an agreement
(in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with a paying agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ")
of the stockholders of the Company and the holders of Convertible Notes for
(i) the payment of the Merger Consideration to which the stockholders of the
Company shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1 and (ii) the payment of
the Convertible Note Consideration to which Convertible Note holders shall
become 

 



4  entitled pursuant to Section 2.2 and pursuant to the terms of the
Convertible Notes Indenture. At or immediately following the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent an
amount in cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.1 and
Section 2.2 (collectively, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not
be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due pursuant to this
Article II (or otherwise due to a holder of Convertible Notes in respect of
such holders Convertible Notes), but the Payment Fund may be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent or Sub,  _provided_ that (i) no such
investment or losses thereon shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this Article II or
affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company
Common Stock or the amount of Convertible Note Consideration payable to
Convertible Note holders, and following any losses Parent or Sub shall
promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent to add to the Payment
Fund for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company and Convertible Note
holders in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such investments shall be in
short term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no
more than thirty calendar days, short term obligations guaranteed by the
United States of America, commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or money market funds having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
investment or in one or more other investment categories proposed by Parent
and approved by the Company prior to the Effective Time. Any interest or
income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
third Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of
an outstanding Certificate or outstanding Certificates which have converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 2.1, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in
customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates. Upon surrender to the Paying
Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate and such Certificate shall then be
cancelled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than
the third Business Day following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall
issue and deliver to each holder of Book-Entry Shares a check or wire transfer
for the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant
to Section 2.1 of this Agreement in respect of such Book-Entry Shares,
without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall
then be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, it shall be a condition of
payment that any Certificate surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall
be otherwise in proper form for transfer or any Book-Entry Share shall be
properly transferred and that the Person requesting payment shall have paid
any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction
of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Article II.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company ("
_DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.
(New York City time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately
available funds equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock held of
record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "),
and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the
Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the
first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately
available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

 



5 (d) At any time following the date that is (i) forty Business Days after the
Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it or its designees any funds (including any interest received with
respect thereto) that have been made available to the Paying Agent for payment
of the Convertible Note Consideration and that have not been disbursed to
holders of Convertible Notes and (ii) twelve months after the Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it or its
designee any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto)
that have been made available to the Paying Agent for payment of the Merger
Consideration and that have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares
of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of the parties hereto, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. All cash paid upon the surrender
of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates.

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for transfer, subject to applicable Law in the case
of Dissenting Shares, such Certificates shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth in, this Article II.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

(g) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement requirements
established by the Paying Agent, including making an affidavit to that effect
and, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in
exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Article II.

Code or Section 4001(b) of ERISA.

 

(b) With respect to each Company Plan listed in Section 3.15(a) and Section
3.15(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company has provided to Parent

benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened relating to or otherwise in connection with any Company
Plan, including, to the knowledge of the Company, concerning or related to any
fiduciary or service provider thereof and, to the knowledge of the Company,
there is no basis for any such legal action, proceeding or investigation, and
(iii) no Company Plan nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any person who is
a party in interest in respect of an Company Plan within the meaning of
Section 3(14) of ERISA with respect thereof, has engaged in a prohibited
transaction which could subject the Company directly or indirectly to
liability under Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and
no Company Plan has engaged in any similar transaction which could subject

the knowledge of the Company, each multiemployer plan), which is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination
letter to that effect and nothing has occurred, whether by action or failure
to act, that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,

or any of its Subsidiaries, including in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and further including on account of a
discontinuance or reduction in contributions thereto; (D) the PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any such plan or made any inquiry which
would reasonably be expected to lead to termination of any Company Plan, and,
no condition exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will be
instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for
the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such
plan; (E) no such Company Plan is, or is expected to be, in "at-risk" status
(as defined in Section 303(i)(4) of ERISA or Section 430(i)(4) of the Code);
and (F) neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has
incurred a reduction in contributions such that if the current rate
of contributions continues, a seventy-percent decline in contributions (as
defined in Section 4205 of ERISA) will occur within the next three plan years.
With respect to any multiemployer plan to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has any material liability or contributes
(or has within the last six years at any time contributed or had an obligation
to contribute): (A) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA
Affiliates has incurred any material withdrawal and/or partial withdrawal
liability under Title IV of ERISA which remains unsatisfied; and (B) to the

insolvent (as those terms are defined in Sections 4241 and 4245 of ERISA,

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.2 (including Section
5.2(b)), at all times during the period commencing with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time,
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall they authorize or
knowingly permit any of their respective Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or induce the making, submission or
announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, a Takeover
Proposal, (ii) furnish or otherwise make available to any Person (other than
Parent, Sub or any designees of Parent or Sub) any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person
(other than Parent, Sub or any designees of Parent or Sub) access to the
business or to the properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
in any such case that would reasonably be expected to result in the making,
submission or announcement of, or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging,
facilitating or assisting, (A) a Takeover Proposal, or (B) any inquiries that
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, (iii) participate
or engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to a
Takeover Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend a Takeover Proposal, (v)
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other Contract
of any kind providing for, contemplating, intended to facilitate or otherwise
relating to, a Takeover Proposal or (vi) authorize, commit, publicly propose
or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if
at any time prior to 11:59 p.m. New York City time on the date that is thirty-
five calendar days after the date hereof, (i) the Company receives a bona
fide, written and unsolicited Takeover Proposal from any Person and (ii) the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel), that such Takeover Proposal constitutes
or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Company
may (A) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, or provide access to the Business or to the properties, assets,
books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the Person making such Takeover
Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (such a confidentiality agreement, an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and (B) participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , that, in the
case of any action taken pursuant to the preceding clauses (A) or (B), (1) the
Company gives Parent prompt (and in any event within three Business Days
following receipt) written notice of the identity of such Person and a
summary of the material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal
(including a copy, if made in writing) and of the Companys participation or
engagement in discussions or negotiations with, or furnishing of non-public
information to, such Person, and (2) promptly (and in any event within one
Business Day) upon furnishing any non-public information to such Person, the
Company furnishes such non-public information to Parent, to the extent such
information has not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent. For
the avoidance of doubt, in the event that a third party contacts the Company
or a Representative of the Company or its Affiliates orally or in
writing regarding a potential Takeover Proposal, the Company shall not be in
breach of this Agreement in any respect to the extent the Company or such
Representative responds to such third party that it is bound by the terms of
this Agreement and is unable to discuss or respond to such matters without
first complying with the procedures set forth herein with respect to any such
discussions provided that the Company provides written notice of such
communication to Parent within two (2) Business Days of such communication.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, Sub and the
Company acknowledge and hereby agree that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this Section 5.2 by any Representative of the

 



25  Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of any such Representative
who is an investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
advisor, to the extent that such Representative is or has been engaged by the
Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby) shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.2 by the Company.

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a),
(b) and (c) of this Section 5.2, the Company shall promptly (and in any event
within two Business Days following receipt) notify Parent orally and in
writing if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their
respective Representatives, receives (i) any Takeover Proposal, (ii) any
request for information that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Takeover Proposal or (iii) any inquiry with respect to, or which would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, such notice
to include a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Takeover
Proposal, request or inquiry (including copies of all documents and written
communications, and written summaries of all oral communications), and the
identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry.
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis on the status and terms of any such Takeover Proposal, request or
inquiry, any material modifications to the terms thereof and any other
material developments related thereto.

(e) The Company shall, and shall ensure that each Person that is a
Representative of the Company immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing solicitation of, or discussions or negotiations with, any Person
relating to any Takeover Proposal.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
(other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) to engage in any (i) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
securities of Subsidiaries) equal to 20% or more of the consolidated assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to which 20% or more
of the revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
are attributable, (ii) acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or (iv) merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture or similar transaction involving the Company (or
any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company that constitute 20% or more of
the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or that contribute 20% or more of the revenues of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis), in each case, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide, written Takeover Proposal made by a
third party, not obtained as a result of any material breach of this Section
5.2, to (A) acquire and/or cancel, directly or indirectly, a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or (B) acquire a majority of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, in the
case of each of clauses (A) and (B) (as applicable), if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that (i) such Takeover Proposal, if consummated, would
be more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point
of view than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) such Takeover Proposal is reasonably likely to be
consummated on the terms so proposed, taking into account all relevant
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal, including any
conditions to closing.

 

Section 5.3. _Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) Subject to Section 5.3(b) and Section 5.3(c), neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii)
adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable, or publicly
propose to adopt, approve, 

 



26  recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable, the adoption of any
Takeover Proposal (it being understood that a "stop-look-and-listen"
communication made in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act with respect to any Takeover Proposal that is a tender offer or
exchange offer shall not be considered a breach of this clause (ii)), (iii)
approve or recommend, or cause or permit the Company to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar document or
contract constituting or relating directly or indirectly to, or that
contemplates or is intended or could reasonably be expected to result directly
or indirectly in, a Takeover Proposal or (iv) authorize, commit or agree to
take any such actions (each such foregoing action or failure to act in
clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to herein as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ").

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the time at which the Stockholder Written
Consent is executed and delivered to Parent in accordance with Section 6.1(a)
(the " _Written Consent Date_ "), the Company Board may effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change:

(i) if the Company Board (A) receives a Takeover Proposal that it determines
in good faith (after having consulted with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) to be a Superior Proposal, (B) concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the
failure to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the directors of
the Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law and (C)
approves or recommends such Superior Proposal; or

(ii) in response to a fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances
that affects the business, assets or operations of the Company that is unknown
to the Company Board at and prior to the execution of this Agreement (such
fact, event, change, development or set of circumstances, an " _Intervening
Event_ ," it being understood that in no event shall the receipt, existence or
terms of a Takeover Proposal constitute an Intervening Event), if the Company
Board has concluded in good faith (to the extent applicable, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that, in
light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of the directors of the Company to
the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company (i) from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Companys stockholders that the Company Board determines to make in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) in order to fulfill
its fiduciary duties or satisfy applicable state or federal securities Laws;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure of a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) of the Exchange Act other than a rejection of any applicable
Takeover Proposal, a reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation or a
"stop-look-and-listen" communication made in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and may be made only in compliance with this Section
5.3.

electronic image scan transmission) thereof is not delivered by the Company to
Parent pursuant to Section 6.1(a), in each case within 48 hours after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties hereto (a "
_Written Consent Failure_ "), Parent shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in Section 8.4(b).

 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery of
the Stockholder Written Consent pursuant to Section 6.1(a), the Company shall

228(e) of the DGCL and (ii), with the assistance of Parent, prepare and file
with the SEC an information statement of the type contemplated by Rule 14c-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act related to the Merger and this Agreement
(such information statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto,
the " _Information Statement_ "). The Information Statement shall also contain
the notice of availability of appraisal rights and related disclosure required
by Section 262 of the DGCL. Parent, Sub and the Company will cooperate with
each other in the preparation of the Information Statement. Without limiting

forth in the Information Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Information Statement
as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof and to have
the Information Statement cleared by the staff of the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such filing. Each of Parent, Sub and the Company
agrees to correct any information provided by it for use in the Information
Statement which shall have become false or misleading. The Company shall as
soon as reasonably practicable notify Parent and Sub of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC with respect to the Information Statement and any
request by the SEC for any amendment to the Information Statement or for
additional information and shall provide Parent with copies of all such
comments and correspondence. Prior to filing or mailing the Information
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to
any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments on such document or response and shall, in good faith, consider and
incorporate the reasonable comments of Parent. Promptly after the Information
Statement has been cleared by the SEC or after 10 calendar days have passed
since the date of filing of the preliminary Information Statement with the SEC
without notice from the SEC of its intent to review the Information
Statement, the Company shall promptly file with the SEC the Information

its stockholders.

shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents and its Subsidiaries
officers, employees and other authorized Representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours from the date of this Agreement through to the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, to its employees,
properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, the Company
shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent such
information concerning the Business and the properties and personnel of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may from time to time reasonably
request, including, without limitation, the monthly "Executive Business
Review" report and other similar monthly financial reports of the Company and
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
require the Company to (i) provide access to any information or documents
that, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, would (A) constitute a waiver
of the attorney-client privilege held by the Company, or (B) violate any
applicable Laws;  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that the Company will
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents for the
disclosure of such information or documents and

 



28  take such other action (such as entering into a joint defense agreement or
other arrangement to avoid loss of the attorney-client privilege) with respect
to such information or documents as is necessary to permit disclosure to
Parent and Parents Representatives or (ii) provide access to any minutes and
resolutions of the Company Board (or any authorized committee thereof) adopted
after the date hereof, to the extent relating to the evaluation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or any alternative transactions, including
any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any investigation or
consultation taken pursuant to this Section 6.2(a) shall be conducted in such
a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant
interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries of their normal duties.

(b) Each of Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause their Representatives to,
hold all information furnished to Parent or Sub by or on behalf of the

Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.3. _Further Action; Efforts_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use (x) its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to

each of the parties, as applicable, agrees to prepare and file as promptly as
reasonably practicable any filings required to be made under any Antitrust Law

Business Days. Parent shall pay all filing fees for the filings required
under any Antitrust Law or Foreign Merger Control Law by the Company and
Parent. Each of Parent and the Company agrees to promptly comply with any
Request for Additional Information and Documentary Materials ( a " _Second
Request_ ") from the relevant Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR Act and
in any event within ninety calendar days of receipt of such Second Request.

 

(c) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of significant
matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining the approvals of
or clearances from each applicable Governmental Entity, including:

 

(i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings required to be made
by any party under any Antitrust Law or Foreign Merger Control Law and
coordinating with each other in relation to each step of the procedure before
the relevant Governmental Entities and as to the contents of all material

opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with the relevant
Governmental Entities, and such first party shall consider and take account of
all reasonable comments timely made by the other party in this respect;

 



29 (ii) furnishing, to the extent permitted by Law, to the other party
all necessary information that the other party may reasonably request in
connection with filings required to be made by such other party under
Antitrust Laws and Foreign Merger Control Laws; and

Section 6.4. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) indemnify and hold harmless, all past and present directors
and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case to the extent
they acted in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or other monetary
liabilities incurred by such individual in connection with any claim or
Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, based on or
arising out of, or pertaining to, in whole or in part, the fact that an
Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or
non-profit entity, including matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby) whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In the
event of any such claim or Action, (i) each Indemnified Party will be entitled
to advancement of expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of legal
counsel) incurred in the defense of any claim or Action from the
Surviving Corporation within ten Business Days following receipt by the
Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor;
_provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.4, (ii)
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of 

 



30  any judgment in any proceeding or threatened claim or Action (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes a release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability arising out of such claim or Action or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents and (iii) the Surviving Corporation and
the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such
matter and Parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof at its
expense with counsel selected by the independent directors of Parent and
Parent shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses
of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Parent elects not to assume such defense or counsel or the Indemnified Party
reasonably advises that there are issues which create conflicts of interest
between Parent, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the other hand,
the Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to them and Parent shall
pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Party promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be obligated pursuant to this
paragraph to pay for more than one law firm for all Indemnified Parties in
any jurisdiction unless the use of one law firm for such Indemnified Parties
would present the attorneys of such law firm with a conflict of interest, in
which case Parent shall only be obligated to pay for representation by the
fewest number of law firms necessary to avoid such conflicts of interest.

(b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall, to the extent permitted by Law, contain provisions no less favorable,
for a period of six years following the Effective Time, with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors and officers than are presently set forth in the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals; _provided_ that the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation may be
amended in any manner if Parent unconditionally assumes all obligations for
such indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation pursuant to the
provisions set forth in such certificate of incorporation and bylaws
immediately prior to such amendment.

(c) If Parent does not elect to purchase a directors and officers liability
"tail" or "runoff" insurance policy with an aggregate coverage limit over the
term of such program in an amount not to exceed the unimpaired annual
aggregate coverage limit under the Companys existing directors and officers
liability policy, and in all other respects substantially comparable to such
existing coverage, the Company may, at its option, prior to the Effective
Time, purchase a six year "tail" policy providing at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous to
the insured as the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not, without Parents consent, make a premium payment for such insurance
to the extent such premium exceeds 200% of the annual premiums paid as of the
date hereof by the Company for such insurance, which annual premiums paid are
set forth in Section 6.4(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (such 200%
amount, the " _Base Premium_ "); _provided however_ , if such insurance
coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at a premium in
excess of the Base Premium, the Company may purchase the most advantageous
"tail" policy of directors and officers insurance reasonably available for
an annual premium equal to the Base Premium

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim or Action
is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, the provisions and benefits of this Section 6.4 shall
continue in full force and effect with respect to such claim or Action until
the final disposition of such claim or Action.

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
legal representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.4; _provided_
that such Indemnified Parties make an undertaking to repay such expenses if it
is determined that they were not entitled to indemnification or expense
reimbursement under this Section 6.4. The indemnification provided for herein
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified
Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

 



31 (f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.4;  _provided_ , _however_ , that a successor or
assign of a Subsidiary of Parent including the Surviving Corporation, shall
not be required to assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.4 if
Parent unconditionally assumes all such obligations.

(g) This Section 6.4 is not intended to limit the rights of any Persons
pursuant to any indemnification agreement listed in Section 3.11 of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

Section 6.5. _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent will consult with
and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
any press release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance
of such press release or other public statement or comment relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such
press release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation
except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange. Parent and the
Company agree that the initial press release announcing the execution and
delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of Parent and
the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.5 shall
limit the Companys or the Company Boards rights to make public statements
about its actions under Section 5.3 without prior consultation.

 

Section 6.6. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company shall take all steps reasonably necessary to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each Person (including any Person who is deemed to be a

this Agreement, including this Section 6.12.

Section 6.13. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on

generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt notice (x)

Financing or (2) dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any
of the Commitment Letter or definitive financing agreements related to the
Financing with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount
of the Financing to be funded at Closing, and (z) if at any time management of
Parent believes it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Commitment Letter or definitive financing agreements
related to the Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent shall
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately
preceding sentence; provided, that Parent need not provide any information
believed to be privileged, that is requested for purposes of litigation or
that is related to fees and other economic information redacted from such
agreements that is consistent with the information redacted from the
Fee Letters executed in connection with the Commitment Letter and consistent
with Section 4.8. Parent shall have the right from time to time to amend,
replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the
Commitment Letter, Fee Letters or definitive financing agreements, and/or
substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the
Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources, _provided_ that
Parent shall not permit any such amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any material provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter or
replace all or a portion of the Financing with alternate financing
arrangements that, in each case, would reduce the aggregate amount of the
Financing (other than immaterial reductions or as otherwise proved in such
Commitment Letter or Fee Letters, including "flex provisions"), amend the
conditions to the drawdown of the Financing in a manner adverse to
the interests of the Company, or which would otherwise in any other respect
reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such
amendment, modification or replacement, provided that Parent shall 

 



36  not be obligated to deliver to the Company copies of any Fee Letters or
other information redacted from such agreements that is consistent with the
economic information redacted from the Fee Letters entered into in connection
with the Commitment Letter and consistent with Section 4.8.

(b) If all or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to promptly obtain such Financing from
alternative sources on terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate,
to Parent (including with respect to the conditionality thereof) in an amount
sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is available to
pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by Parent in connection with the
Merger (" _Alternative Financing_ "), and to obtain a new financing commitment
letter (the " _Alternative Commitment Letter_ "), fee letter and a new
definitive agreement with respect thereto (the " _Alternative Financing
Agreement_ ") that provides for financing on terms not materially less
favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and in an amount that is sufficient,
when added to the portion of the Financing that is available, to pay in cash
all amounts required to be paid by Parent and the Surviving Corporation in
connection with the Merger.

(c) References in this Agreement to (i) "Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated under the Commitment Letter and any Alternative
Commitment Letter as permitted by this Section 6.13 to be amended, modified,
supplemented or replaced (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
alternate financing transactions permitted hereunder), (ii) "Commitment
Letter" shall include such documents as permitted by this Section 6.13
(including any Alternative Commitment Letter) to be amended, modified or
replaced, in each case from and after such amendment, modification or
replacement and (ii) definitive financing agreements shall be deemed to
include any Alternative Financing Agreement.

permitted successors and assigns. This Agreement is the product of negotiation
by the parties having the assistance of counsel and other advisers. It is the
intention of the parties that this Agreement not be construed more strictly

Section 9.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile, ".pdf," or other electronic transmission) in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 9.6. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned (by operation
of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of each of the other
parties hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto
and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

Section 9.7. _Parties in Interest_. Except as provided in Section 6.4 and
Section 9.9(c), Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not,
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein other than, if the Effective Time occurs, the right of (a)
the Companys stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Article II and (b) the holders of Company Stock Options, RSUs and Equity Share
Units to receive the amounts specified in Section 2.1. The parties hereto
further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.4
shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The
representations and warranties in this

 



48  Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are
for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with Section 8.8 without notice or liability to any other Person.
In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

Section 9.8. _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CLAIMS ARISING UNDER OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE
PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

Section 9.9. _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction_. 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other
legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for such damage. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or any federal court of competent jurisdiction located in
the Borough of Manhattan in the State of New York without proof of actual
damages or otherwise (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy.

(b) Any Action arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may only be brought in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware or any federal court of competent jurisdiction located
in the Borough of Manhattan in the State of New York, and each party hereto
irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction and venue of the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York and the courts hearing
appeals therefrom unless no federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, in
which event, each party hereto irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction and
venue of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the courts hearing
appeals therefrom. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not
to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Action arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve process in accordance with this Section 9.9, that it or its property
is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, that the Action in any such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Action is improper, or that
this Agreement, or the subject matter of this Agreement, may not be enforced
in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder,
fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the
party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction. Each party shall take all such action as may be necessary to
continue said appointment in full force and effect or to appoint another agent
so that it will at all times have an agent for service of process for the
above purposes. Each party further irrevocably consents to the service
of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any Action arising out
of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
the mailing of copies thereof by registered airmail, postage prepaid, to such
party at its address set forth in this Agreement, such service of process to
be effective upon acknowledgement of receipt of such registered mail. Nothing
herein shall affect the right of any party to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed
against the

 



49  other party in any other jurisdiction in which the other party may be
subject to suit. Each party expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver
is intended to be irrevocable under the laws of the State of Delaware and of
the United States of America; _provided_ that each such partys consent to
jurisdiction and service contained in this Section 9.9 is solely for any
Action arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to said
courts other than for such purpose.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto
acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any Action, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing
Sources arising out of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby,
the Financing Commitments, the Financing or the performance of services
thereunder or related thereto shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
of any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York,
New York, and any appellate court thereof and each Party hereto submits for
itself and its property with respect to any such Action to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (ii) not to bring or permit any of
their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Action
in any other court, (iii) that service of process, summons, notice or document
by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided
in Section 9.2 shall be effective service of process against them for any such
Action brought in any such court, (iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which any of them may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such Action in any such court, (v) to waive
and hereby waive any right to trial by jury in respect of any such Action,
(vi) that a final judgment in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law, (vii) that any such Action shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State that would result in the
application of the laws of any other State, (viii) none of the Financing
Sources will have any liability to the Company or its Affiliates (excluding at
and after the Effective Time, Parent and its Subsidiaries) relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Financing or otherwise, whether at law, or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any of
its Affiliates (excluding at and after the Effective Time, Parent and its
Subsidiaries) will have any rights or claims against any of the Financing
Sources hereunder or thereunder, and in no event shall the Company be
entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against
the Financing Sources and (ix) that the Financing Sources are express third
party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any provisions in this Agreement
reflecting the foregoing agreements.

Section 9.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any Action,
seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the
other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among
other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 9.10.

Section 9.11. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the
extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the
provisions of Article VIII, including the remedies, and limitations thereon,
be construed as integral provisions of this Agreement and that such
provisions, remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner
that diminishes a partys rights hereunder or increases a partys liability or
obligations hereunder.
