and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled
to the extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the provisions of Article VIII, including the remedies, and limitations thereon, be construed as integral provisions of this Agreement and that such provisions, remedies
and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that diminishes a party&#146;s rights hereunder or increases a party&#146;s liability or obligations hereunder. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"><FONT
