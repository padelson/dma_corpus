ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later
than the tenth calendar day after the date of the first public announcement
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (including the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase for cash all Shares
at the Offer Price. The obligations of Merger Sub, and of Parent to cause
Merger Sub, to accept for payment and pay for any Shares tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to (i) the
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition (as defined in _Exhibit A_ hereto) and
(ii) the satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub of each of the other
conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto (together with the Minimum
Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). Each of Parent and Merger Sub
expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (A) increase the
Offer Price, (B) waive any Offer Condition or (C) modify any of the other
terms or conditions of the Offer, except that, unless otherwise provided by
this Agreement, without the consent of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall not (1) reduce the Offer Price, (2) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer (other than by adding consideration), (3) reduce the
number of Shares subject to the Offer, (4) impose additional conditions to
the Offer, (5) waive or change the Minimum Condition, (6) add to the Offer
Conditions, (7) extend or otherwise change the expiration time of the Offer
except as required or permitted by _Section 1.1(b)_ or (8) amend or modify
any Offer Condition or any term of the Offer in a manner that is, or would
reasonably be expected to be, adverse to the holders of Shares.

 

(b) The Offer shall expire at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date that
is 21 Business Days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the commencement of the Offer (the "
_Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Date has
been extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date and
time to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or
such later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has been so
extended, the " _Expiration Date_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless this Agreement has been terminated
in accordance with _Article VIII_ (and subject to each partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ ), the Offer shall
be extended from time to time as follows:

 

(i) If, on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, the Offer
Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by Parent or Merger Sub if
permitted hereunder and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, then Merger
Sub shall (and Parent shall

 



2  cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer for successive periods of up to ten
Business Days each until the Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived;
_provided_ _,_ _however_ , that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend
the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

(ii) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by
applicable Law, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (or its staff) (the " _SEC_ ") or the NASDAQ Capital Market ("
_NASDAQ_ ").

 

(d) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except in the event
that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_. In the
event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ ,
Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours of such termination), terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated prior to
the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and
shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all
tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

(e) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction
of all of the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub will accept for payment (the time
of such acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ ") and thereafter pay for all
Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as
soon as practicable after the Expiration Date or as soon as practicable
following the valid tender thereof.

 

Section 1.2 _Offer Documents_. As promptly as reasonably practicable on the
date of commencement of the Offer (subject to  _Section 1.1_), Parent and
Merger Sub shall (a) file a Schedule TO (together with all exhibits,
amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with respect to the
Offer, which shall contain or shall incorporate by reference an offer to
purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") and forms of the related letter

stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during
such period, merger or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration

earned portion determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
Company Stock Right, including the Companys Change in Control Plan, to the
extent applicable, or, in the case of Company Stock Rights earned on the basis
of the price of the Shares, to the extent the Merger Consideration results in
such Company Stock Right becoming earned.

 

(c) Immediately following the Acceptance Time, to the extent necessary, Parent
shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited with the Company cash in U.S.

thereto.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions as
may be reasonably required to effectuate the provisions of this  _Section
3.2_ and shall deliver all required notices to each holder of Company Stock

expire or be cancelled) shall be canceled effective as of the Effective Time,
without any liability on the part of the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or Omron (except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement).

 

Section 3.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall enter into an
agreement (in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with such bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the
stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") to receive the Merger Consideration to which stockholders of
the Company shall become entitled pursuant to this _Article III_. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited)
with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to make all payments
pursuant to this  _Article III_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than to fund payments due pursuant to this _Article III_, except as
provided in this Agreement. Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the

 



8  Paying Agent, incurred by it in connection with the exchange of Shares for
the Merger Consideration and other amounts contemplated by this _Article
III_.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
fifth Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
(" _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
held by such Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent) in customary form and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as the
Paying Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange for the Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) the Merger
Consideration for each such Share, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to issue and send to
each holder of uncertificated Shares represented by book entry (" _Book-
Entry Shares_ "), other than with respect to Excluded Shares and Dissenting
Shares, a check or wire transfer for the amount of cash that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ in respect of such Book-
Entry Shares, without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or
an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry
Shares shall then be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration.

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and shall
be properly transferred, and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Any other transfer or similar
Taxes incurred in connection with the Merger will be paid by Parent.

 

(d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.3_, each Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof,
pursuant to this _Article III_, without any interest thereon.

 

(e) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this  _Article II_ shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Shares that were
outstanding

 



9  immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 

(f) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis. If for any reason (including investment
losses) the cash in the Payment Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of
the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder (but
subject to _Section 3.4_), Parent shall promptly deposit cash into
the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and
shall be payable to, Parent.

(g) At any time following the date that is 12 months after the Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it or its
designee any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto)
which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof
with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of
their Certificate. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in
connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. None of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall
be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by the Companys
stockholders at such date as is immediately prior to the time at which such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of any claims or interests of any
such stockholders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives
previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
holders compliance with the replacement requirements established by the
Paying Agent, including, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(i) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon
the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. At or after the Effective
Time, the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, subject to compliance with
the provisions of this _Article III_ by the holder thereof and subject to 
_Section 3.4_, represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby.

 



10 Section 3.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, to the extent required by the DGCL, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to payment of
the fair value of such shares in accordance with the DGCL (and, at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to
perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holders right to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
loses any such right to appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall
thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to
receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right
to appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_, and Parent shall promptly
deposit (or cause to be deposited) in the Payment Fund additional cash in an
amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares
that are no longer Dissenting Shares. The Company shall serve prompt notice to
Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and control ( _provided_
that, prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall not have the right to control
such negotiations and proceedings where the interests of the Company or
any of its Affiliates are, or would reasonably be expected to be, adverse to
those of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates) all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, without the prior consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), make any payment with respect to, or
settle, any such demands.

 

Section 3.5 _Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such
amounts as the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "),
or any provision of any other Tax Law; _provided_ that a determination as to
whether such withholding is required shall be made in good faith
after consultation with the Company and provided further that Parent agrees
that, other than any Taxes required to be withheld in respect of compensatory
arrangements with any present or former employee or service provider of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (i) no Japanese Taxes shall be
deductible and withheld from such consideration paid to such holder and (ii)
no U.S. Taxes shall be deducted and withheld from such consideration paid to
such holder, _provided_  that (a) such holder timely provides a properly
completed IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8, as applicable, (b) the FIRPTA
Certificate is furnished by the Company to Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (c) there is no intervening change in Law. Any amounts so
withheld under this _Section 3.5_ and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be. The " _FIRPTA Certificate_ " means a properly completed
statement, in form and

 



11  substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and dated as of the Closing
Date, that the Company is not, and has not been during the applicable period,
a "United States real property holding corporation" for purposes of Sections
897 and 1445 of the Code.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

 

PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the
Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure

section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of this Agreement
to which the relevance of such information is reasonably apparent), Omron,
Parent and the Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

 

Section 5.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_.

 

(a) Each of Omron, Parent and Merger Sub (i) is a corporation duly organized,

its incorporation, (ii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or
the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, except for any such failures to be so organized,
existing and good standing, to have such power and authority or to be so
qualified or licensed or in good standing as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means
any event, change, circumstance, occurrence or effect that would prevent or
delay beyond the Outside Date the performance by Omron, Parent or Merger Sub
of its obligations under this Agreement necessary to consummate the Offer and
the Merger.

the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub, in each case, as

necessary corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its

consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by the Board of
Directors of each of Omron, Parent and Merger Sub, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Omron, Parent or Merger Sub are
necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in the case of
consummation of the Merger, to the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as required by the DGCL. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Omron, Parent and Merger Sub
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Omron, Parent and Merger
Sub, enforceable against each of Omron, Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms (except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy,

 



30  insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of
equity).

 

Section 5.3 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of
Omron, Parent and Merger Sub does not, and the consummation of the Offer, the

or violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Omron, Parent
or Merger Sub (or equivalent organizational documents), (ii) assuming that
all consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by _clauses (i)_
through _(v)_ of _subsection (b)_ below have been obtained and all filings
described in such clauses have been made, conflict with or violate any Law

properties are bound or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default), or result in the loss of a benefit under, or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of,
any Contract to which Omron, Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective properties are bound, except,
in the case of _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , for any such conflict, breach,
violation, default, loss, right or other occurrence that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Parent
and Merger Sub, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will not
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Entity, except for (i) such filings
as may be required under applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and under state securities,
takeover and "blue sky" laws, (ii) the filings required under the HSR Act and
any filings required under Foreign Antitrust Laws, (iii) such filings as

have a Parent Adverse Material Effect.

respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty

Documents based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by or on

consent, then Parent shall be deemed to have provided its consent.

 

Section 6.2 _Conduct of Omron, Parent and Merger Sub Pending the Closing_.
From and after the date hereof until the earliest to occur of the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, each
of Omron, Parent and Merger Sub agree that it shall not, directly or
indirectly, and shall not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to,
take, or agree or commit to take, any willful action or willfully refrain
from taking any action, which would (i) reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
(ii) result in any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Exhibit A_ or
any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article 7_ not being
satisfied prior to the Outside Date, in the case of each of _clause (i)_ and
_clause (ii)_ , except for any action or failure to take action (A) required

applicable, shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries
respective operations.

 

Section 6.4 _Solicitation of Transactions; Recommendation_.

 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.4_, the Company agrees that
neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives,
including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or encourage (including by
providing information, _provided_ that any communication undertaken by the
Company in the ordinary course of business 

 



36  and not related, directly or indirectly, to an Acquisition Proposal, the
Offer or the Merger or any other similar transaction shall not, in and of
itself, be deemed an action by the Company to encourage) any proposals or
offers with respect to, or the making or completion of, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations or discussions (other
than to state that they are not permitted to have discussions) concerning, or
provide or cause to be provided any non-public information or data relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with, an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) waive or provide any consent under any "standstill" or
similar restrictions contained in any confidentiality or other agreements to
which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party that restricts
the making of an Acquisition Proposal, unless the Company Board concludes in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failing to so
waive or provide consent would be inconsistent with the Company Boards
exercise of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Laws, and any waiver or consent so granted shall not be
deemed to be the encouragement, initiation or solicitation of an Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v)
approve, endorse or recommend, or execute or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in  _Section 6.4(b)(ii)(B)_) (each, a
" _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , it is
understood and agreed that any determination or action by the Company Board
permitted under  _Section 6.4(b)_ or _(c)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ shall
not be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.4(a)_. The Company agrees
that it, its Subsidiaries and its Representatives will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting this _Section 6.4_, it is agreed that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.4_ by any
Representative acting for, on behalf or at the direction of the Company, or
any Subsidiary of the Company shall constitute a breach of this _Section 6.4_
by the Company.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.4(a)_, at any time
prior to, but not after, the Acceptance Time, the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Representatives may participate in discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish or disclose non-public information with respect
to the Company and its Subsidiaries to, any Person in response to an
unsolicited,  _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to
the Company by such Person after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Acceptance Time if, and only if, (i) the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii) prior to participating in discussions or
negotiations with, or furnishing or disclosing any non-public information to,
such Person, the Company (A) notifies Parent of its receipt of such
Acquisition Proposal and its intent to take such action and (B) receives from
such Person an executed confidentiality agreement that is on terms not
materially less restrictive to such Person than the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent, and (iii) promptly after furnishing
or discussing any non-public information to such Person making
such Acquisition Proposal or its Representatives, the Company makes available
to Parent any such non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
or its Representatives to the extent such information was not previously
provided or made available to Parent.

 



37 (c) Subject to the permitted actions contemplated by _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold,
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw, modify
or qualify, the Recommendation, in each case, in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, (ii) except as permitted by this _Section 6.4_, fail to include
the Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9, (iii) if a tender or exchange offer
for shares of capital stock of the Company that constitutes an Acquisition
Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender or
exchange offer by the stockholders of the Company (including by taking no
position with respect to the acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by
the stockholders of the Company) within ten Business Days after commencement
thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act or (iv) approve,
authorize or recommend or otherwise declare advisable, or propose publicly to
approve, authorize or recommend or otherwise publicly declare advisable, any
Acquisition Proposal or Company Acquisition Agreement (any of such actions, an
" _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 6.4_, at any time prior to, but not after, the Acceptance
Time, the Company Board may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal if, and only if, (A) such Acquisition
Proposal was not solicited by the Company or caused by the Company to have
been solicited, in each case, following the date of this Agreement in
violation of _Section 6.4_, (B) the Company provides Parent with a written
notice indicating that the Company, acting in good faith, believes that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and, therefore, plans to
conduct a meeting of the Company Board for the purpose of considering whether
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, which notice shall
be delivered to Parent at least three Business Days prior to the date of such
meeting of the Company Board and shall also include a copy of such Acquisition
Proposal (or, if made orally, a reasonable description of the material terms
of such Acquisition Proposal) and the other information required by _Section
6.4(d)_, (C) during such three Business Day period the Company shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to
the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal shall cease
to constitute a Superior Proposal, (D) the Company Board makes the
determination that such Acquisition Proposal (after taking into account any
adjustment to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to such proposal) constitutes a Superior Proposal and (E) the Company
Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel)
that failing to make an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company Boards exercise
of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Laws.
Upon any amendment to the financial terms or any other material amendment of
an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within
24 hours) provide a new notice to Parent describing such amendment and the
obligations set forth in _clauses (C)_ and _(D)_ of this _Section 6.4(c)_
shall continue for at least two Business Days after delivery to Parent of such
notice (and, if necessary, the Company Board meeting shall be postponed to
accommodate such additional negotiation period).

(d) The Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of (i) any written Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any
written request for non-public information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to
be related to an Acquisition Proposal and (iii) any written inquiry or request
for discussion or negotiation regarding an Acquisition Proposal, including, in
each case, the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request

 



38  and a copy of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request (or, if made
orally, a reasonable description of the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request).

 

(e) Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication
to shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer
or exchange offer) or from (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys
stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, failure to disclose such information
would violate its obligations under applicable Law; _provided_ , that any
disclosure permitted under this _Section 6.4(e)_ shall be deemed, subject to
the last sentence of this _Section 6.4(e)_, an Adverse Recommendation Change
unless it includes either an express rejection of the Acquisition Proposal or
an express reaffirmation of the Recommendation. A "stop, look and listen" or
similar public communication contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement.

(f) As used in this Agreement:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or group of Persons other than Parent or one of its Subsidiaries for
(A) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving an acquisition of the Company or
any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 15%
or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (for the 12-month period ending on the last day
of the Companys most recently completed fiscal quarter) or (B) the
acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, of over 15% of the equity
securities or consolidated total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
in each case other than the Offer, Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ , written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company did not solicit or cause to be solicited following
the date of this Agreement in violation of this _Section 6.4_ (A) on terms
which the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to the holders of Shares than the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent in response to
such proposal), taking into account all the terms and conditions and legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person making
the proposal, and (B) that the Company Board believes is reasonably likely
to be completed in accordance with its terms, taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; _provided_ ,
that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references
to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "50%."

 



39 Section 6.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries, officers,
directors and Representatives to, afford to Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, consistent with applicable
Law, to its officers, employees, properties, offices, other facilities and
books and records, and shall furnish Parent and its Representatives with all
financial, operating and other data and information as Parent shall reasonably
request in writing (it being agreed that the foregoing shall require the
Company, its Subsidiaries, officers, directors and Representatives to permit
Parent and its officers, employees or Representatives to conduct any Phase I
environmental assessment; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company, its
Subsidiaries, officers, directors and Representatives shall have no obligation
in respect of any environmental testing or sampling, including, but not
limited to, facility surface and subsurface soils and water, air or building
materials). All requests for such information pursuant to this _Section 6.5_
shall be made through the Chief Financial Officer of the Company or such
Person as he shall delegate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
such investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not
to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would (i) breach any agreement with any
third-party, (ii) constitute a waiver of or jeopardize the attorney-client or
other privilege held by the Company or (iii) otherwise violate any applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall provide notice to Parent
of the fact that it is withholding access to information pursuant to _clause
(i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iii)_ of this _Section 6.5(a)_ and use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such information to be made available in a manner
that would not reasonably be expected to cause such breach, waiver or
violation.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, dated May 29, 2015, between
Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

 

Section 6.6 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and cooperate with each
other in order to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law (including under any Antitrust Law) to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the earliest practicable date
(subject to the terms of this Agreement), including: (i) causing the
preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be
filed to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain
any requisite consent or expiration of any applicable waiting period under the
HSR Act and Foreign Antitrust 

 



40  Laws; (ii) using reasonable best efforts to defend all lawsuits and other
proceedings by or before any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; and (iii) using reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objection asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement under any Antitrust Law raised by any Governmental Entity and to
prevent the entry of any court order, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any injunction, decree, ruling, order or other action of any
Governmental Entity that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay
the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In clarification of the foregoing, such
reasonable best efforts of Omron, Parent and Merger Sub shall exclude, to the
extent such actions would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on the business of Omron, Parent or, after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation, any obligation of Omron, Parent or Merger Sub to
hold separate, divest or enter into a consent agreement or assume any
obligation (whether structural or behavioral) with regard to (A) any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of Omron or Parent, (B) after the
Effective Time, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries acquired pursuant to
this Agreement and/or (C) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries. To the extent such reasonable best efforts of
Omron, Parent and/or Merger Sub would require Omron, Parent and/or Merger Sub
to hold separate, divest or enter into a consent agreement or assume any
obligation (whether structural or behavioral) with regard to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, product lines
or assets, Parents, Omrons and/or the Companys effectuation of such actions
shall be contingent upon the consummation of the Offer and the Merger.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no action taken
by Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall entitle Parent to any
reduction of the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of _Section
6.6(a)_, each of the parties, as applicable, agrees to prepare and file as
promptly as practicable, and in any event by no later than ten Business Days
from the date of this Agreement an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act. Parent shall pay all filing fees for
the filings required under the HSR Act by the Company and Parent; each of the
parties shall otherwise bear their own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with such filings.

 

(c) If a party receives a request for information or documentary material from
any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, a Second
Request for Information under the HSR Act, then such party shall in good faith
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, a response which is, at a minimum, in
substantial compliance with such request, to the extent substantial compliance
with such request is reasonably necessary to any requisite consent or
expiration of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.

(d) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining the approvals of or
clearances from each applicable Governmental Entity, including:

 



41 (i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings required to be made
by any party under any Antitrust Law and liaising with each other in relation
to each step of the procedure before the relevant Governmental Entities and as
to the contents of all communications with such Governmental Entities. In
particular, to the extent permitted by Law or Governmental Entity, no party
will make any notification in relation to the transactions contemplated
hereunder without first providing the other party with a copy of such
notification in draft form and giving such other party a reasonable
opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with the relevant
Governmental Entities, except that no party shall be obligated to provide to
the other party any portion of its HSR Act notification filing not customarily
furnished to another party in connection with HSR Act filings, and such first
party shall consider and take account of all reasonable comments timely made
by the other party in this respect;

 

(ii) furnishing to the other party all information within its possession that
is required for any application or other filing to be made by the other party
pursuant to the applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) promptly notifying each other of any communications from or with any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and ensuring to the extent permitted by Law or Governmental Entity
that each of the parties is entitled to attend any meetings with or other
appearances before any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(iv) consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with all
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to the Antitrust Laws; and

 

(v) without prejudice to any rights of the parties hereunder, consulting and
cooperating in all respects with the other in defending all lawsuits and
other proceedings by or before any Governmental Entity challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(e) In addition, Omron and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all other action and to do, or cause to be done, all
other things necessary, proper or advisable under all Antitrust Laws to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to obtain the
expiration of all waiting periods and obtain all other approvals and any
other consents required to be obtained in order for the parties to consummate
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, commercially and/or competitively sensitive
information and materials of a party will be provided to the other party on
an outside counsel-only basis, where such information is customarily furnished
to another party on an outside-only counsel basis in connection with HSR Act

Section 6.7 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, each of the Company, Omron and Parent and their
respective Board of Directors shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Law with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any Action commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Offer, the

solely for immaterial monetary relief or (c) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause or result in any of the
Offer Conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto or any of the conditions to
the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ not being satisfied or satisfaction of
those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any provision of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit
the remedies available to the party receiving such notice; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that failure to give prompt notice pursuant to _clause (c)_ shall
not constitute a failure of a condition to the Merger set forth in  _Article
VII_ or the Offer Conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto except to the
extent that the underlying fact or circumstance not so notified would standing
alone constitute such a failure.

 

Section 6.9 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Omron and Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer, director
or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_
"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries,
fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees and disbursements (collectively,

 



43  " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i)
the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in each case, to the fullest extent
and in the manner permitted by the DGCL and the Company Charter and Company
Bylaws as at the date hereof. In the event of any such Action, (A) each
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of any Action from Parent or the Surviving Corporation to the fullest
extent and in the manner permitted by the DGCL and the Company Charter
and Company Bylaws as at the date hereof; _provided_ , that any Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification, (B) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding
or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or claim or such Indemnified Party
otherwise consents, and (C) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense of any such matter.

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Omron, Parent and the
Company agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor
of any Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or in any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified
Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and
continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such directors or
officers arising out of such acts or omissions, except as otherwise required
by applicable Law, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party.

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance, fiduciary liability insurance and employee
practices liability insurance (to the extent applicable to directors of the
Company as of the date of this Agreement) maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies or purchase or cause
the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy," in either case of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are
not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay with respect to
such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant
hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount; _provided further_ , that if the Surviving
Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and the coverage thereunder costs more
than 300% (per coverage year) of such last annual premium, the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained
for

 



44  300% (per coverage year) of such last annual premium. At the Companys
option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year
prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope)
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance, fiduciary liability insurance
and employee practices liability insurance (to the extent applicable to
directors of the Company as of the date of this Agreement) maintained by the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions
contemplated hereby. If such tail prepaid policy has been obtained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, then (i) Parent shall not be required to
purchase or cause to be purchased any substitute policy or "tail policy," and
(b) Parent shall cause such policy to be paid and maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Surviving Corporation and any successor thereof.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Action.

 

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly
are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Omron or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Surviving Corporation or Parent or Omron, as the case may be, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.9_.

 

Section 6.10 _Employment and Employee Benefit Matters; Other Plans_.

 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any current or former employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Employee_ ")
may have under any Company Plan, except as otherwise agreed in writing between
Parent and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain the severance-related
provisions of any written employment Contract or Change in Control Severance
Agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement and to provide 100% of
the severance payments and benefits required thereunder to be provided to any
Company Employee party to any such written employment Contract or Change in
Control Severance Agreement whose employment with the Company is terminated
during that 12-month period.

 



45 (b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals (but not for purposes of benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plans), under any employee
compensation, incentive, and benefit (including vacation) plans, programs,
policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as
of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation for the Company Employees service with the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") to the
same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.
With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent and its Subsidiaries shall, to the fullest
extent reasonably practicable under the terms and conditions of such plan or
related insurance policies, (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing
condition or eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any
deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and
amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees under
similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing
between Parent and a Company Employee or as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, Parent will honor, and will cause its Subsidiaries to honor, in
accordance with its terms, (i) each existing employment, change in control,
severance and termination protection plan, policy or agreement (excluding any
equity-based plan, program or agreement) of or between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of that company, (ii)
all obligations in effect as of the Effective Time under any bonus or bonus
deferral plans, programs or agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries and
(iii) all obligations in effect as of the Effective Time pursuant to
outstanding restoration plans, programs or agreements (excluding any equity-
based plan, program or agreement), and all vested and accrued benefits under
any employee benefit, employment compensation or similar plans, programs,
agreements or arrangements of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(d) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries,
for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending 90 days thereafter,
not to effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are
defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988
(together with any similar state or local Law, " _WARN_ ") affecting in whole
or in part any site of employment, facility, operating unit or Company
Employee.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.10_ shall create any third-party beneficiary
right in any Person other than the parties to this Agreement, create any
right to continued employment, or modify or prevent, subject to Parents
obligations under _Section 6.10(a)_ and _Section 6.10(c)_, the termination
of any employment, severance, termination, consulting, retirement or other
compensation and benefit plans, programs, arrangements, agreements or
policies.

Section 6.11 _Public Announcements_. Each of Omron, Parent and Merger Sub, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each
other a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release
or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any

 



46  such press release or make any public announcement prior to such
consultation and review, except as may be required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.11_ shall not
apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made (a)
following a determination by the Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or (b) following an Adverse Recommendation
Change. Omron, Parent and the Company agree that the press release announcing
the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of Omron
or Parent and the Company.

 

Section 6.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such Shares) resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

Section 6.13 _Resignation of Directors; Appointment of Parent Designees_. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent
on or prior to the Acceptance Time the resignation of the Companys directors,
which resignations shall be subject to the appointment and due election of
directors designated by Parent in compliance with the Company Charter and
Company Bylaws. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent shall be entitled to
designate up to such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number,
on the Company Board as shall give Parent representation on the Company
Board equal to the product of (x) the total number of directors on the
Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this
sentence) multiplied by (y) the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares
beneficially owned by Merger Sub and any affiliate of Parent following such
acceptance for purchase bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding,

necessary to cause Parents designees to be elected as directors of the
Company.

appropriate to obtain at the Acceptance Time pay-off letters in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent evidencing the amount (the " _Pay-off
Amount_ ") necessary to pay-off, at the Acceptance Time, all existing
indebtedness and other obligations (excluding any letters of credit
outstanding as of the Effective Time and identified in writing by the Company
to Parent at least five Business Days prior to the Effective Time, which
Parent will, directly or indirectly, assume or otherwise provide
acceptable replacement letters of credit) under the Loan and Security
Agreement, dated as of June 9, 2014, by and between the Company and Comerica
Bank (as amended from time to time, the " _Credit Agreement_ "). At or prior
to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries
to, pay, on behalf of the Company, the Pay-off Amount to an account or
accounts designated by the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement and
take such reasonable action as necessary to replace such outstanding letters
of credit as of the Effective Time.

Section 6.18 _Stockholder Litigation_. Subject to any fiduciary duties of the
Company Board or the board of directors of any of the Companys Subsidiaries,
the Company shall consult with Parent in the Companys defense or settlement
of any stockholder litigation (other than any litigation or settlement where

be expected to be, adverse to those of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates) against the Company and/or any of its directors
or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
_provided_ that the Company shall not settle, compromise or enter into an
agreement (other than any settlement, compromise or agreement solely for

stockholder litigation relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement requiring (a) the payment of any amount in excess of the amount set
forth on _Section 6.18_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, (b) the acceptance

(acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board) shall take
all such actions as may be required to cause any agreements, arrangements or
understandings that have been or will be entered into by Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates with current or future directors,
officers or employees of the Company and its Affiliates pursuant to which
payments are made or to be made or benefits are granted or to be granted
according to such arrangements (including any amendment or modification
thereof) to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1)
under the Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive
safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act, provided that

amounts withheld by the Company on behalf of the participants in the Company
Employee Stock Purchase Plan as of such date (the " _ESPP Purchased Rights_

warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement or fraud, in
which case the non-breaching party shall be entitled to all rights and

known to the stockholders of the Company, and not withdrawn prior to such
termination under  _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ and (B) within 12 months after such
termination, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or shall have consummated, an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ ,
that for purposes this _Section 8.3(b)(i)_, the references to "15% or more"
in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"more than 50%");

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)(ii)_; or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_

 

then, in any such case, the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee, it
being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) Payment of the Termination Fee, if applicable, shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated
by Parent (i) on the earlier of the execution of a definitive agreement with
respect to or consummation of, any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition

_Section 8.3(b)(i),_ (ii) concurrently with such termination, in the case of
a termination by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ or  _(iii)_
as promptly as reasonably practicable after termination (but in no event later
than two Business Days after termination), in the case of termination by
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_.

 

(d) Payment of the Termination Fee from or on behalf of the Company shall (i)
be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered
or incurred by Omron, Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates
or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination
hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the 

 



52  abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for the termination
giving rise to payment of such Termination Fee and (ii) subject to the rights
and remedies available to Omron, Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to and under
each of the circumstances described in _Section 8.2(b)_, be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Omron, Parent and Merger Sub against the Company, its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents, general and limited partners, managers, members, stockholders and
Affiliates (each, a " _Company Party_ ") for any loss or damage suffered as a
result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder, and no Company Party shall have any other
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amounts
due pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amounts set forth in this _Section 8.3_, the Company shall pay to Parent its
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant
to this _Section 8.3_ from the date such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment, compounded quarterly, at the prime lending rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.

Section 8.4  _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented by the parties by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after Merger Sub has accepted for payment and
paid for Shares pursuant to the Offer, no amendment may be made which
decreases the Merger Consideration. This Agreement may not be amended,
modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or
otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an
amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the
time of the amendment.

 

Section 8.5 _Extension of Time; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties may, by action taken or authorized by their respective
Boards of Directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the
time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other
parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other parties set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered
pursuant hereto or (c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions of the other parties contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly
authorized officer on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party
in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power,
or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power,
or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.

period under the HSR Act in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not have expired or been terminated, or (ii) any approvals or
consents required in respect of the transactions contemplated by this

continuing at the Expiration Date:

(i) any Governmental Entity or court of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued an order, decree, injunction or ruling or taken any other action
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent in nature) restraining,
enjoining, making illegal or otherwise prohibiting the Offer, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; _provided_ that
none of Omron, Parent or Merger Sub shall have committed a willful and
material breach of its obligations set forth in _Section 6.6(a)_ to contest,
appeal or seek to have removed such order, decree, injunction, ruling or
other action;

(ii) any Law shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated, enforced or
deemed applicable by any Governmental Entity that, in any such case, prohibits
or makes illegal the making of the Offer, the acceptance for payment of any

that, individually or in the aggregate, are immaterial in nature and amount;
or (2) any other representation or warranty of the Company contained in the
Merger Agreement (without giving effect to any references to any Material
Adverse Effect or materiality qualifications and other qualifications based
upon the concept of materiality or similar phrases contained therein) shall
fail to be true and correct in any respect as of the date of the Merger

date, in which case as of such earlier date), except as has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate with all
other failures to be true or correct, a Material Adverse Effect (and, in the
case of  _Section 4.15(a)(ii)_, a material adverse effect on the assets
(taken as a whole), business, results of operations or financial condition of
Omron or Parent and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
excluding, for purposes of this parenthetical, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries)); or (C) Parent and Merger Sub shall not have received a
certificate of an executive officer of the Company, dated as of the scheduled
Expiration Date, to the effect set forth in the foregoing _clauses (A)_ and
_(B)_ ;

to extend, terminate or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Merger Agreement. All conditions (except for the Minimum Condition) may
be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in their sole discretion in whole or in part
at any applicable time or from time to time, in each case subject to the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC. The failure of Parent or Merger Sub at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

 

Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ and not otherwise defined shall
have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Agreement and Plan of
Merger to which this _Exhibit A_ is attached (the " _Merger Agreement_ ").
