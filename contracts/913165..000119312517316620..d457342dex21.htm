approving this Agreement and the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held prior to the

WHEREAS, certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
Section 9.03. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein and intending to be legally
bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _The Merger_

 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the FBCA, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ").
At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger
(the " _Surviving Company_ ").

 

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger
shall take place at the offices of Ropes and Gray LLP, Three Embarcadero
Center, San Francisco, California at 7:00 a.m., Pacific time, on a date to be
specified by the Company and Parent, which shall be no later than the second
Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law)
waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions at
the Closing). By agreement of the parties, the Closing may take place by
delivery of the documents to be delivered at Closing by facsimile or
other electronic transmission. All deliveries by one party to any other party
at the Closing shall be deemed to have occurred simultaneously and none shall
be effective until and unless all have occurred, unless the parties agree
otherwise. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file
with the Department of State the articles of merger relating to the Merger
(the " _Articles of Merger_ "), containing the provisions required by, and
executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the FBCA. The Merger
shall become effective at the time that the Articles of Merger have been duly
filed with the Department of State, or at such later time as the Company and
Parent shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.04 _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the FBCA.

Section 1.05 _Articles of Incorporation and  By-Laws_. The articles of
incorporation of the Company shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action, be amended and restated to read in
their entirety as set forth on  _Exhibit B_ and, as so amended and restated,
shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Company until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein and by applicable Law. The
by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein, by the articles of incorporation and
by applicable Law, except that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be
replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Company.

 

Section 1.06 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Company_. The directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors
of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their death, resignation or
removal and until their respective successors are duly elected

 



2  and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company
until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case
may be.

ARTICLE II

 

 _Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_

 

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") or any shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub ( " _Merger Sub Common Stock_
"):

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of Merger Sub
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger
Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted
in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Stock; Conversion of Subsidiary-Owned
Stock_.

 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned directly by Parent or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company as
treasury stock or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other
than Merger Sub) or of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor. For the avoidance of doubt, all shares of
Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted Shares, if any) contributed
to Parent by the Rollover Investors (collectively, the " _Rollover Shares_ ")
prior to the Effective Time shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than Rollover Shares, shares to be canceled or converted into shares of the
Surviving Company in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_ and Dissenting Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive $42.00 in cash, without interest
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such shares of Company

 



3  Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason
of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have
occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be proportionately adjusted to
reflect such change.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment Fund; Deliverables_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, at its sole
cost and expense, appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment
and delivery of the Merger Consideration. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock, for payment in accordance with this _Article
II_ through the Paying Agent, cash sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration.
All such cash deposited with the Paying Agent is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Payment Fund_." Subject to Section 2.02(e), the Payment Fund shall be
used solely for purposes of paying the Merger Consideration and shall not be
used to satisfy any other obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As reasonably promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
a Certificate a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_
") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent, shall be in such form and have such other
provisions (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to shares held in book-entry form) as Parent
may specify subject to the Companys reasonable approval, and shall be
prepared prior to the Closing), together with instructions thereto.

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i)
in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a physical
Certificate, the surrender of such physical Certificate for cancellation to
the Paying Agent together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or (ii) in
the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form, the
receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent, in each case together
with such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration into which such shares of
Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.01_, without
interest thereon. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Company Common Stock (or, if such Company Common Stock is
held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that

 



4  any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.02(c)_, each share of Company Common Stock,
and any Certificate with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from
and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue
on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or shares of Company
Common Stock held in book-entry form).

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon
conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock
(or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) are presented to
Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one year immediately
following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of
Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this  _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon.

 

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
in the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such
investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of
a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Ratings Service, respectively, or
in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in
mutual funds investing in such assets. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to, and be the property of, Parent. No
investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish
the rights of any of the Companys shareholders to receive the Merger
Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To the extent there
are losses with respect to such investments or the Payment Fund diminishes
for any other reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of
the aggregate funds required to be paid pursuant to the terms hereof, Parent
shall reasonably promptly (and in any event within 10 Business Days) replace
or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.

 



5 (h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Company and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder
of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Shares or Company Stock Options
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law.
Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Shares or Company Stock Options,
as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, all compensatory amounts
subject to payroll reporting and withholding payable pursuant to or as
contemplated by this Agreement shall be payable as promptly as possible
through the payroll system of the Surviving Company (or an Affiliate thereof)
in accordance with applicable payroll procedures.

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and if reasonably
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, pay the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

(j) _Payoff Letters; Customary KYC Material_. The Company shall (i)
deliver to Parent, no later than the third Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, customary pay-off letters relating to the repayment on the Closing Date
of the Existing Company Debt and the release of related Liens and (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Parent no later than the fifth
Business Day prior to the Closing Date any Customary KYC Material.

 

(k) _Company Equity and Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(i) _Company Stock Options_. Each Company Stock Option, to the extent
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and in consideration for such cancellation, the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the product of (A) the excess, if any, of (y) the Merger Consideration over
(z) the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option multiplied by
(B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option (less any applicable withholding under _Section 2.02(h)_) (the "
_Option Consideration_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, each Company Stock
Option with a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration shall be cancelled as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time with no consideration payable to the holder thereof. As of the
Effective Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and each holder

 



6  thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, other than the
right to receive the Option Consideration. Immediately after the Effective
Time, Parent shall deliver to the Company, for the benefit of holders of
Company Stock Options entitled to receive the Option Consideration in
accordance with this _Section 2.02(k)(i)_, cash sufficient to pay the Option
Consideration in accordance with  _Section 2.02(k)(iv)_.

(ii) _Company Restricted Shares_. Each Company Restricted Share that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully
vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be treated as
an outstanding share of Company Common Stock for purposes of this Agreement
and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect thereto, less applicable withholdings in accordance with _Section
2.02(h)_.

 

(iii) _Company ESPP_. From and after the date of this Agreement, (i) no
new Offering Period or Exercise Period (in each case, as defined in the
Company ESPP) shall commence under the Company ESPP, (ii) no new participant
may begin to participate in the Company ESPP, and (iii) no participant may
increase his or her rate of payroll deductions under the ESPP. If the
Effective Time is scheduled to occur prior to the end of the Offering Period
in existence under the Company ESPP on the date of this Agreement, the Company
will take such action necessary to cause the Exercise Date (as defined in the
ESPP) for such Offering Period to occur, and all outstanding options to
purchase Company Common Stock under the Company ESPP to be exercised, prior to
the Effective Time and, after providing for such early exercise, any
remaining balance in any participants account to be returned to such
participant. Each share of Company Common Stock received under the Company
ESPP shall be treated as an outstanding share of Company Common Stock for
purposes of this Agreement and the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto, less applicable
withholdings in accordance with _Section 2.02(h)_.

 

(iv) _Payments_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Surviving Company shall make, or cause to be made, all payments required
under this _Section 2.02(k)_, less applicable withholdings in accordance with
_Section 2.02(h)_, through the payroll system of the Surviving Company (or an
Affiliate thereof).

 

(v) _Company Actions_. The Company Board, or the applicable committee
thereof, shall take all necessary actions to terminate, as of the Effective
Time, all Company Stock Plans and the Company ESPP and all rights thereunder,
in each case, without liability to Parent or any of its Affiliates (including,
following the Closing, the Surviving Company), other than the obligation to
pay the amounts contemplated by this _Section 2.02(k)_. Not later than two
(2) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide
Parent with drafts of all resolutions and other written actions or
communications as may be required to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section 2.02(k)_ for Parents reasonable review and comment.

 



7 Section 2.03 _Dissenters  Rights_. Holders of Company Common Stock who
are entitled to appraisal rights pursuant to Section 607.1302 of the FBCA, and
who dissent from the Merger pursuant to Section 607.1321 of the FBCA, may be
entitled, if they comply with the provisions of the FBCA
regarding dissenters rights, to be paid the fair value of their respective
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with such provisions of the FBCA.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, including 
_Section 2.01(c)_, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
holders who have properly demanded and perfected their rights to be paid the
fair value of such shares in accordance with Section 607.1302 of the FBCA
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only
such rights as are granted by the FBCA. If any such holder of Company Common
Stock shall fail to perfect or effectively shall withdraw or lose such
holders right to be paid fair value under Sections 607.1321 and 607.1323 of
the FBCA, then such holder shall have the rights set forth in the FBCA. The
Company or the Surviving Corporation shall promptly give Parent (i) notice of
any notice received by the Company of intent to demand the fair value of any
shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such notices and any other
notices served pursuant to Section 607.1321 of the FBCA and received by the
Company (or the Surviving Corporation) and (ii) the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of such
dissenters rights under Section 607.1302 of the FBCA. The Company (or the
Surviving Corporation) shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent (which may be given or withheld in its sole and absolute discretion)
or as otherwise required by applicable Law, make any payment with respect to
any such exercise of dissenters rights or offer to settle, or settle, any
such rights. The Company agrees to timely comply with the applicable
provisions of Sections 607.1320 and 607.1322 of the FBCA.

 _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_

 

Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the
Company that the statements contained in this _Article III_ are true and
correct except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to
the Company at or before the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub
of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "). The Parent Disclosure
Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to
the numbered and lettered sections contained in this _Article III_ , and the
disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify any other section in
this  _Article III_ to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face
of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such
other section.

 

Section 3.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has all organizational power
and authority required to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to perform each
of its obligations hereunder. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified
or licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its
business or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to
be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



8 Section 3.02 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite organizational power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder, and
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The general partner of Parent has adopted resolutions (i) approving
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and (ii) determining
that entering into this Agreement is in the best interests of Parent and its
equityholders. Such resolutions have not been amended or withdrawn. The Merger
Sub Board has unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement; (ii) determining that the terms
of this Agreement are in the best interests of Merger Sub and the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub; (iii) declaring this Agreement advisable; and (iv)
recommending that the sole shareholder of Merger Sub adopt this Agreement and
directing that this Agreement be submitted to the sole shareholder of Merger
Sub for adoption. Such resolutions have not been amended or withdrawn. The
sole shareholder of Merger Sub has adopted and approved this Agreement. No
other proceedings (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any shareholder
approval) on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize,
adopt or approve, as applicable, this Agreement or to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for the
filing of the Articles of Merger as required by the FBCA). Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this
Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms except, in each case, as enforcement
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity.

Section 3.03 _No Conflicts; Consents_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement does not, and the performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of
its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result
in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation, any obligation to make an offer to purchase or
redeem any Indebtedness or capital stock or any loss of a material benefit,
require a consent or waiver under, require the payment of a penalty or change
in control payment under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub under, any provision of (i)
the governing or organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) any
written or oral contract, lease, sublease, license, indenture, note, bond,
agreement, understanding, undertaking, concession, franchise or other
instrument (in each case, to the extent legally binding on the parties
thereto) (a " _Contract_ ") to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by
which any of their respective properties or assets is bound; or (iii) subject
to the filings and other matters referred to in  _Section 3.03(b)_, as of
the date hereof, any judgment, order or decree (" _Judgment_ "), any federal,
state, local or municipal, whether foreign, multinational or domestic,
statute, law (including common law), ordinance, rule, regulation, code,
constitution, treaty or other requirement of law of any Governmental Entity ("
_Law_ ") or Permit, in each case, applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clause (ii)
above, any matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and

instrumentality, whether domestic, foreign or supranational (a " _Governmental
Entity_ "), is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
its performance of its obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than (i) (A)

be made or obtained under foreign antitrust, competition, trade regulation or
similar Laws, as set forth on _Section 3.03(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Department of State
and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of the other
jurisdictions in which Parent and the Company are qualified to do business and
(iii) such other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 3.04 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or
to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3 will, at the respective
times that the applicable document is filed with the SEC and first mailed
or otherwise disseminated to the Companys shareholders, at the date it or
any amendment or supplement thereto is mailed to the Companys shareholders
and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading;
_provided_ , that no representation is made by Parent or Merger Sub with
respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on
information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.

 

Section 3.05 _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, threatened in writing against Parent or Merger Sub that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any Judgment outstanding
against or, to the Knowledge of Parent, investigation by any Governmental
Entity involving Parent or Merger Sub that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 3.06 _Brokers  Fees and Expenses_. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders,
financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent for which the Company could
have any liability prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 3.07 _Merger Sub_. Parent, or a direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary thereof, is the sole shareholder of Merger Sub. Since its date of
incorporation, Merger Sub has not carried on any business nor conducted any
operations other than the execution of this Agreement, the performance of its
obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.

 



10 Section 3.08 _Florida Business Corporation Act_. Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub, nor any affiliate or associate of either of the foregoing, is, nor
at any time during the last four years has been, an "interested shareholder"
of the Company as defined in Section 607.0901 of the FBCA. As of the date of
this Agreement, none of Parent, its Subsidiaries, affiliates or associates
beneficially own (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities of the
Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Common
Stock or other securities of, or any other economic interest (through
derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Company.

 

Section 3.09 _Financing_.

 

(a) Attached as _Exhibit C_ is a true, correct and complete copy of the
executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, among Parent, the
Fund and the Company (the " _Financing Letter_ "), pursuant to which the Fund
has committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest, or
cause to be invested, in Parent, directly or indirectly through one or more
intermediate entities, the cash amounts set forth therein (the " _Financing_
").

 

(b) Assuming the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the Financing
Letter, the amount of funds to be provided pursuant to the Financing Letter,
together with any cash on hand or other sources of financing immediately
available to Parent, Merger Sub and/or the Fund, is at the date hereof and at
the Closing will be sufficient in the aggregate to pay at the Effective Time
(i) the Required Amounts and (ii) any and all fees and expenses, and satisfy
all other payment obligations, required to be paid or satisfied by Parent,
Merger Sub and, to the extent disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub prior to the
date hereof, the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger and the
Financing.

(c) As of the date hereof, the Financing Letter is in full force and
effect and has not been terminated, amended or modified in any respect, no
such termination, amendment or modification is contemplated and the respective
commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise
modified in any respect. There are no conditions precedent, or other
contractual contingencies as between Parent and the Fund, related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in the
Financing Letter. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred or circumstance
exists which, with or without notice or lapse of time, or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent
or Fund under the Financing Letter. As of the date hereof, Parent has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated in
the Financing Letter will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be
made available to Parent at or prior to the time contemplated hereunder for
Closing. There are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements related
to the Financing other than the Financing Letter. As of the date hereof,
Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any and
all commitment or other fees which are due and payable on or prior to the date
hereof pursuant to the terms of the Financing Letter. Without limiting the
foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company acknowledges that Parent
and Merger Sub may finance payments contemplated by this Agreement through
third party debt financing sources or otherwise (including pursuant to
agreements or commitment letters that Parent or its Affiliates 

 



11  have entered into or may enter into prior to, concurrently with or after the
execution of this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of
any doubt, the parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledge and agree that,
subject to the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII, irrespective of
any other provision of this Agreement (express or implied), including without
limitation, the provisions of  _Section 5.06_, any such financing activities
and the unavailability for any reason of the Financing contemplated by the
Financing Letter shall not, in and of itself, in any way, affect, delay or
alter the performance and payment obligations of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Fund under this Agreement or the Financing Letter and, if all conditions to
Closing set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by Law), waived (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of those conditions at the Closing), Parent, Merger Sub and the Fund thereupon
shall be obligated to consummate the Merger and all of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with _Section
1.02_.

Section 3.10 _Solvency of the Surviving Company Following the Merger_. As
of the Effective Time, assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Parents
obligation to consummate the Merger, or waiver of such conditions, (ii) the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in this
Agreement (without giving effect to any limitations as to "Company Material
Adverse Effect") and material compliance by the Company with the covenants
contained in this Agreement and (iii) the most recent financial forecasts of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries delivered to Parent have been
prepared in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue to be
reasonable, immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, payment of all amounts to be paid on the Closing Date,
including the aggregate Merger Consideration, repayment or refinancing of any
Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing Letter, if any,
and payment of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, will be Solvent. For the purposes of
this _Section 3.10_, the term " _Solvent_ ," when used with respect to any
Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" (determined on a going concern basis) of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, exceed the value of all "liabilities of
such Person, including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as
such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors (including
a reasonable estimate of the amount of contingent liabilities); (b) such
Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date; and (c) such Person will be able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature
(including a reasonable estimate of the amount of contingent liabilities).
For purposes of this definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of
capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed
to be engaged" and "able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will be able to
generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or lines of credit,
or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

 

Section 3.11 _Certain Arrangements_. Except as set forth in _Section
3.11_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement,
there are no Contracts or other agreements, arrangements or understandings
(whether oral or written) or commitments to enter into agreements,
arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) (i) between Parent,
Merger

 



12  Sub, the Fund or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of
the Companys management or directors, on the other hand, that relate in any
way to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) pursuant to which any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock would be entitled to receive consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which
any shareholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the
Merger or agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

 

Section 3.12 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge that (i) the Company has not made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the Company or its
Subsidiaries furnished or made available to Parent or Merger Sub, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto, and (ii) other than in the case of actual fraud, no Person shall have
or be subject to any liability to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person
resulting from the distribution to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person, or
Parents, Merger Subs or any other Persons use, of any information,
documents or materials made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person in any physical or electronic form (including in any "data room"),
management presentations, memoranda or in any other form in expectation of the
Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that
none of the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any other Person
has made any representation or warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or
achievement of any financial projections, forecasts, cost estimates, capital
budgets, business plans or other similar information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_

 

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the
statements contained in this _Article IV_ are true and correct except (i) as
set forth in the Company SEC Documents furnished or filed and publicly
available after December 31, 2016 and prior to the date of this Agreement (the
" _Filed Company SEC Documents_ ") (provided that nothing disclosed in such
Filed Company SEC Documents shall be deemed to be a qualification of or
modification to the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
4.03(a)_, _Section 4.03(b)_,  _Section 4.04_, the first sentence of
_Section 4.08_ and _Section 4.20_), excluding any disclosures in the Filed
Company SEC Documents under the headings "Risk Factors" or "Forward-
Looking Statements" or any other disclosures in the Filed Company SEC
Documents which are similarly cautionary, predictive or forward looking in
nature, or (ii) as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company
to Parent at or before the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "). The Company Disclosure Letter
shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections contained in this _Article IV_ , and the
disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify any other section in this
_Article IV_ (other than the second sentence of _Section 4.04_ and the first
sentence of  _Section 4.08_) to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to
such other section.

 



13 Section 4.01 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and
each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized (in
the case of good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes
such concept), except in the case of the Company Subsidiaries where the
failure to be so organized, exist or be in good standing has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as presently
conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in
each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent, prior to
execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of the amended and
restated articles of incorporation of the Company in effect as of the date of
this Agreement (the " _Company Charter_ ") and the amended and restated by-
laws of the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Company
By-laws_").

Section 4.02 _Company Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) _Section 4.02(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of
the date of this Agreement, the name and jurisdiction of each Company
Subsidiary.

(b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, each Company Subsidiary have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable
and are owned, of record and beneficially, by the Company, by a Company
Subsidiary or by the Company and a Company Subsidiary, free and clear of all
Liens, excluding Permitted Liens, and free of any other material pre-emptive
right or material restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock, voting securities or other
equity interests), except for restrictions imposed by applicable securities
laws.

 

(c) Except for the capital stock and voting securities of, and other equity
interests in, the Company Subsidiaries, none of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity participation or similar interests in, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any capital
stock or voting securities of, or other equity participation or similar
interests in, any Person.

 

Section 4.03 _Capital Structure_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 30,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock. At the close of business on October 18, 2017,
(i) 14,529,710 shares of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted
Shares) were issued and outstanding; (ii) 1,500,000 shares of Company Common
Stock were reserved and available for issuance pursuant to the Company Stock

exercise of outstanding Company Stock Options with a weighted average exercise
price of $18.58 per share); (iii) 106,971 shares of Company Common Stock
were reserved for

 



14  issuance under the Company ESPP (of which an estimated 11,358 shares were
subject to outstanding options granted under the Company ESPP, based on
assumed aggregate employee contributions for the current Exercise Period (as
defined in the Company ESPP) equal to $266,000 and assuming no terminations or
withdrawals). _Section 4.03(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
complete and accurate list, at the close of business on October 18, 2017, of
all outstanding Company Stock Options, indicating with respect to each such
Company Stock Option the name of the holder thereof, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, the exercise
price, the date of grant, the vesting provisions dates and any accelerated
vesting provisions. There are no outstanding Company Stock Awards other than
the Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares issued under the
Company Stock Plans set forth on _Section 4.03(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter. The Company has made available to Parent complete and accurate copies
of all Company Stock Plans and the forms of all agreements evidencing Company
Stock Awards. Except as set forth in this _Section 4.03(a)_, at the close of
business on October 20, 2017, no shares of capital stock or voting securities
of, or other equity interests in, the Company were issued, reserved for

violation of, any purchase option, call option, right of first refusal,

Awards or other rights with respect to shares of Company Common Stock to any
current or former employee, director, consultant or independent contractor of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary have been made in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan and award agreements thereunder and
any policy of the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company (the "
_Company Board_ ") (including any committee thereof) relating to the grant of
such awards or rights. Each Company Stock Award and purchase right under the
Company ESPP qualifies for the Tax and accounting treatment afforded to such
Company Stock Award or purchase right, as applicable, in the Companys Tax
returns and financial statements, respectively. Except as set forth above in
this _Section 4.03_, there are not issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding, and there are not any outstanding obligations of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, (x) any capital stock of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock or
voting securities of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, (y) any warrants, calls, options or other rights to acquire from
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any other obligation of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, any capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity
interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (z) any rights issued
by, or other obligations of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary that are
linked in any way to the price of any class of Company Capital Stock or any
shares of capital stock of any Company Subsidiary, the value of the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any part of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
any dividends or other distributions declared or paid on any shares of
capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Except for
acquisitions, or deemed acquisitions, of Company Common Stock or other equity
securities of the Company in connection with (i) the 

 



15  payment of the exercise price of Company Stock Options with Company Common
Stock (including in connection with "net exercises"), (ii) required tax
withholding in connection with the exercise of, vesting or settlement of
Company Stock Awards, and (iii) forfeitures of Company Stock Awards, there are

Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital
stock or voting securities or other equity interests of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or any securities, interests, warrants, calls, options or
other rights referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the
immediately preceding sentence. There are no debentures, bonds, notes or
other Indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible
into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters
on which the Companys shareholders may vote (" _Company Voting Debt_ ").
None of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to or is
bound by any voting agreement, shareholder agreement or other instrument with
respect to the voting, sale or transfer of any capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, the Company. None of the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement pursuant to
which any Person is entitled to elect, designate or nominate any director of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

(c) Except as set forth in  _Section 4.03(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, there is no outstanding Indebtedness
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary other than as reflected in the

Section 4.04 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_.
The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject,
in the case of the Merger, to the receipt of the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by all shares of
Company Common Stock at the Company Shareholders Meeting approving the Merger
(the " _Company Shareholder Approval_ "). The Company Common Stock is the
only class or series of capital stock or other security entitled to vote on
the Merger, and the Company Shareholder Approval is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of the Companys capital stock or other
securities necessary for the adoption of this Agreement. The Company Board or
a duly appointed committee has adopted resolutions, by vote of the directors
present at a meeting duly called at which a quorum of directors of the
Company was present, (i) approving the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement, (ii) determining that entering into this Agreement is fair to
and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders (other than the
Rollover Investors) and that this Agreement is advisable, (iii) recommending
that the Companys shareholders approve and adopt this Agreement and directing
that this Agreement be submitted to the Companys shareholders for approval
at a duly held meeting of such shareholders for such purpose (the " _Company
Shareholders Meeting_ ") and (iv) to the extent necessary, having the effect
of causing the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not to be subject to any state takeover Law or similar Law that
might otherwise apply to such execution, delivery, performance or
consummation. Subject to _Section 5.04(d)_, such resolutions have not been
amended or withdrawn. Except for the Company Shareholder Approval, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are 

 



16  necessary to authorize or adopt this Agreement or to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for the
filing of the Articles of Merger as required by the FBCA). The Company has
duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms except, in each case, as enforcement may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity.

 

Section 4.05 _No Conflicts; Consents_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not,
and the performance by it of its obligations hereunder and the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, any obligation to
make an offer to purchase or redeem any Indebtedness or capital stock or any
loss of a material benefit under, require a consent or waiver under, require
the payment of a penalty or change in control payment under, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary under, any provision of (i) the Company Charter, the
Company By-laws or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any
Company Subsidiary (assuming that the Company Shareholder Approval is
obtained), (ii) any Contract to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their respective properties or

each case, applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their
respective properties or assets (assuming that the Company Shareholder
Approval is obtained), other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any
matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) No Consent of or from, or registration, declaration, notice or filing
made to or with any Governmental Entity, Union or any stock market or stock
exchange on which shares of Company Common Stock are listed for trading is
required to be obtained or made by or with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or its performance of its obligations hereunder or the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

Company Material Adverse Effect.

the Company Shareholder Approval (but not thereafter), the Company or any of
its Representatives receives a written Alternative Proposal from any Person or
group of Persons, which Alternative Proposal did not result from any breach
of this _Section 5.04_, (A) if the Company Board determines that the failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under Florida Law and (B) if the Company Board
determines in good faith, After Consultation, that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,

Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public
information) with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or
group of Persons who has made such Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that the
Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide to Parent

Representatives, an unredacted copy of the transaction documents for any such
Alternative Proposal provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

"Confidential Information" under, and subject to the terms of, the

(including any tender or exchange offer) within 10 Business Days after the
announcement or commencement thereof, or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend to the shareholders of the Company an
Alternative Proposal (actions described in this clause (i) being referred to
as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii) authorize, cause or permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent,

terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the

Alternative Proposal that did not result from a violation of _Section 5.04_,
the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ if the Company Board has determined
in good faith, After Consultation, (x) that failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under Florida Law and (y) that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to making any such
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement (1) the Company
has given Parent at least four Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action (which notice shall include, to the extent in
the possession of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives, an unredacted copy of the Superior Proposal, an unredacted
copy of the most recent draft of the relevant proposed transaction agreements
and an unredacted copy of any proposal letter, side letter, other ancillary
document and/or financing commitments (including fee letters) relating thereto
and a written summary of the material terms of any Superior Proposal not made
in writing, including any financing commitments relating thereto), (2)

in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent has
notified the Company that it wishes to so negotiate, to enable Parent to
submit to the Company prior to the expiration of the aforementioned notice
period a proposed definitive amendment to this Agreement (in such form which,
if accepted and approved by the Company Board and entered into, would
constitute a binding definitive agreement among the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub) (and, if applicable, the Financing Letter and/or any other
material transaction documents), and (3) if Parent shall have submitted to the
Company prior to the expiration of such notice period the proposed definitive
amendments described in clause (2), the Company Board shall have determined in
good faith, After Consultation, that after giving effect to such proposed
amendments and entering into the definitive amendment to this Agreement (and,
if applicable, the Financing Letter and/or any other material transaction
documents) proposed by Parent that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , (i) that
any change to the price or other material change to the material terms of
such Superior Proposal will require a new written notice to be delivered by
the Company to Parent consistent with the content requirements described in
clause (1) above and a new two Business Day period and negotiation period
shall commence under this _Section 5.04(d)_, (ii) the Company has complied in
all material respects with its obligations under this _Section 5.04_, and

Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 8.03_ prior to or concurrently
with such termination.

 



41 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time
the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, but not after, solely in
response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board may effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of the Company has determined
in good faith, After Consultation, that failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under Florida Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to taking such action,
(x) the Company Board has given Parent at least four Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action and a description of the
reasons for taking such action, (y) the Company has negotiated, and has caused
its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such
notice period, to the extent Parent has notified the Company that it wishes to
so negotiate, to enable Parent to submit to the Company prior to the
expiration of the aforementioned notice period a proposed definitive
amendment to this Agreement (in such form which, if accepted and approved by
the Company Board and entered into, would constitute a binding definitive
agreement among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub) (and, if applicable,
the Financing Letter and/or any other material transaction documents) and (z)
if Parent shall have submitted to the Company prior to the expiration of such
notice period the proposed definitive amendments described in clause (y), the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith, After Consultation, that
after giving effect to such proposed amendments and entering into the
definitive amendment to this Agreement (and, if applicable, the Financing
Letter and/or any other material transaction documents) proposed by Parent,
that failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Florida
Law.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.04_ shall prohibit the Company
from (x) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012 of Regulation M-A under the Exchange
Act or (y) making any disclosure to its shareholders if the Company Board
determines in good faith, After Consultation, that making such disclosure
would be required by applicable Law (and, in the case of the Company Boards
fiduciary duties, not making such disclosure would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Florida Law) or (ii) making
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to its shareholders pursuant to
Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
shareholders of the Company whether or not in the context of a tender offer or
exchange offer that discloses the occurrence of any state of facts, events,
conditions or developments but does not include an Adverse Recommendation
Change); _provided_ that, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that a
factually accurate public or other statement made by the Company (including in
response to any unsolicited inquiry, proposal or expression of interest made
by any Person to the Company not in violation of this _Section 5.04_) that
describes the operations of the provisions of this _Section 5.04_ and of
_Section 8.01(d)_ will not, in and of itself, constitute an
Adverse Recommendation Change for any purpose of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , in any of the foregoing, so long as any such statement includes an
express reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation.

(i) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal or offer

financial point of view, than the Merger, and is reasonably capable of being
consummated, taking into account all financial, legal, financing, regulatory
and other aspects of such Alternative Proposal that are reasonably relevant
to a determination of the likelihood of consummation of such Alternative
Proposal (including the reputation of the Person or Group making the

understood and hereby agreed that such confidentiality agreement need not
contain a "standstill" or similar provision that prohibits the counterparty
thereto or any of its Affiliates or Representatives from submitting an
Alternative Proposal to the Company Board); _provided_ , _however_ , that such
confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit compliance by the Company with

Section 5.05 _Financing Commitments_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Letter and (ii) not permit any amendment
or modification to be made to, or consent to any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Financing Letter without the written consent of the Company.

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to
maintain in effect the Financing Letter in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, (ii) satisfy all conditions to the
Financing Letter that are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub that are within
their control in order to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing
Date required by _Section 1.02_, (iii) comply with their obligations under
the Financing Letter and (iv) enforce their rights under the Financing Letter
in the event of a breach by any other party thereto. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
prompt notice (x) of any breach or default by any party to the Financing
Letter of which Parent and Merger Sub become aware and (y) of the receipt by
Parent or Merger Sub of any notice or other communication from any Financing
source with respect to any (A) breach, default, termination or repudiation by
any party to the Financing Letter of any provisions of the Financing Letter or
(B) dispute or disagreement between the parties to the Financing Letter that
could cause the Financing to become unavailable. As soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business Days of the date the
Company delivers Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to
any circumstance referred to in clause (x) or (y) of the immediately
preceding sentence; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger
Sub shall be under any obligation to provide any information that, if
provided, would, in accordance with advice provided to Parent and Merger Sub
by their outside legal counsel, adversely affect the ability of Parent or
Merger Sub to assert attorney-client or attorney work product privilege or a
similar privilege.

 

(c) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Financing Letter for
any reason and such portion is reasonably required to fund the Required
Amounts, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use best efforts to arrange to
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
debt financing from debt financing sources (the " _Alternative Financing_ ")
in an amount sufficient to pay the Required Amounts. In the event that
Alternative Financing shall be obtained pursuant to this  _Section 5.05(c)_,
each of Parent and Merger Sub shall comply with its covenants in _Section
5.05(a)_ and _Section 5.05(b)_ with respect to such Alternative Financing.

 



44 (d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither
the availability nor the terms of the Financing or any Alternative Financing
are conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger.

 

Section 5.06 _Debt Financing_.

 

(a) It is acknowledged that (x) Parent intends to, either directly or
indirectly through an Affiliate of Parent, obtain certain senior debt
financing(s) (collectively, the " _Debt Financing_ ") in connection with the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement on the Closing Date and (y) on
and after the date of this Agreement, in connection with any such Debt
Financing, Parent and/or its Affiliates may obtain commitments for such Debt
Financing and enter into certain commitment letters in respect thereof (each
such commitment letter, together with all exhibits, schedules and annexes
thereto, and fee letters executed in connection therewith, in each case, as
amended, restated, modified or otherwise supplemented from time to time, a "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ "). The terms and conditions of any Debt
Financing and any Debt Commitments Letters shall be solely determined by the
parties to the applicable Debt Financing and/or Debt Commitment Letters, as
applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not have any right of consent with respect thereto (and such terms and
conditions need not be acceptable to the Company and its Subsidiaries).
Nothing in this Agreement restricts Parents or Merger Subs ability to enter
into any such Debt Commitment Letters, or other documentation, with respect
to any Debt Financing. Parent and Merger Sub may amend, restate, supplement or
otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letters or the documentation related to
the Debt Financing at any time without limitation. Notwithstanding anything
else provided in this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall have no
obligation to provide any updates, notice or other information with respect to
the Debt Financing and/or the Debt Commitment Letters, as applicable, to
the Company or its Subsidiaries. If all or any portion of any Debt Financing
becomes unavailable (including, without limitation, on the terms and
conditions contemplated in a Debt Commitment Letter) the Parent may, but shall
in no way be obligated or required under this Agreement to, arrange
replacement debt financing in respect thereof and obtain any new debt
financing commitment letter(s) with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub expressly
acknowledges and agrees that neither the availability nor terms of the Debt
Financing are conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger.

 

(b) Prior to Closing, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to provide (and to cause the Company Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to provide) Parent
and Merger Sub with such cooperation that is reasonably necessary or customary
in connection with the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by
Parent. Such cooperation shall include reasonable best efforts in respect of
the following:

 

(i) participation in, and assistance with, as applicable, the Marketing
Efforts related to the Debt Financing;

(ii) delivery to Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Sources of the
Debt Financing Information and all Debt Financing Deliverables as promptly as

45 (iii) customary assistance to Parent in the preparation of the Debt
Financing Documents (in each case, including any exhibits and schedules
thereto);

 

(iv) taking such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent or Merger
Sub to facilitate the satisfaction on a timely basis of all conditions
precedent to obtaining the Debt Financing that are within the Companys or any
Company Subsidiarys control;

 

(v) upon reasonable request, to identify any material non-
public information contained in the Marketing Materials and comply with
Regulation FD to the extent applicable to such material non-public information
(provided, that the Company shall be under no obligation to publicly disclose
any material non-public information if, in the reasonable discretion of the
Company, it determines that it is inappropriate to do so); and

 

(vi) deliver such due diligence materials as is reasonably available to it
and as is reasonably requested by Parent and customarily delivered in
connection with procuring and entering into any Debt Commitment Letters, any
documentation and agreements with respect to the Debt Financing and in
connection with the Marketing Materials;

 

(vii) _provided_ that (A) no agreement executed by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries shall be effective until the Effective Time and none
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to take
any action under any such agreement that is not contingent upon the Closing or
that would be effective prior to the Effective Time ( _provided_ that the
Company will execute customary authorization letters required by the Debt
Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing) and (B) the foregoing
provisions shall not require cooperation to the extent it would (i) interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, (ii) result in the Company or the Company Subsidiaries paying
any commitment or other fee prior to the Effective Time, (iii) cause any
condition to Closing set forth in _Sections 7.01_ or _7.03_ to not be
satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement (including any
representations or warranties thereunder), (iv) cause the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries to incur liability in connection with the Debt Financing
prior to the Effective Time, (v) cause any director, officer or employee of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to incur any personal
liability (including that none of the boards of directors (or equivalent
bodies) of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as constituted prior to
the Effective Time shall be required to enter into any resolutions or take
similar action approving the Financing), (vi) result in the contravention of,
or that could reasonably be expected to result in a violation or breach of, or
a default under, any Laws or under any material Contract to which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is a party in effect on the date hereof, (vi)
require the Company to provide access to or disclose information that the
Company determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries or would otherwise be restricted from
disclosure in accordance with the proviso in _Section 6.02_ or (vii)

 



46  require the Company to prepare separate financial statements or any other
information of the type required by Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of
Regulation S-X prior to the Effective Time for any Company Subsidiary or any
subsidiary or other investment that is not consolidated or any other
affiliate of the Company.

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of all of its and the Company
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing, in accordance with
customary practice and subject to any reasonable restrictions that the Company
may impose; _provided_ that the logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries or the reputation or the goodwill of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries.

 

(d) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company obtained by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.06_ shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that the Company
agrees that Parent and Merger Sub may share non-public or otherwise
confidential information with the Debt Financing Sources (including potential
Debt Financing Sources) and ratings agencies in connection with the
Marketing Efforts relating to the Debt Financing if the recipients of such
information agree to customary confidentiality arrangements, including "click
through" confidentiality agreements and confidentially provisions contained in
customary bank books, provided that the Company has, prior to any such
disclosure by Parent and Merger Sub, had an opportunity to review such
confidentiality agreements and confidentiality provisions and such agreements
or provisions provide confidentiality obligations under Regulation FD.

(e) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with
the cooperation contemplated by _Section 5.06(b)_.

(f) Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, its Affiliates and its Representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and the
provision of any information utilized in connection therewith and the delivery

any written information, including financial statements, provided by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for use in connection with the Debt

Shareholders Meeting (the " _Record Date_ "), the Company shall not change the
Record Date or establish a different record date for the Company Shareholders
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event that the date

interfere in any material respect with the normal business operations of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be required to permit such access or make such disclosure, to
the extent it determines, After Consultation, that such disclosure or access
would reasonably be likely to (i) violate the terms of any confidentiality
agreement or other Contract with a third party entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent of such third party to such
access or disclosure); (ii) result in the loss of any attorney-client
privilege; or (iii) violate any Law ( _provided_ that the Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access or make such
disclosure in a manner that does not violate Law). All information exchanged
pursuant to this _Section 6.02_ shall be subject to the confidentiality
agreement, dated as of August 7, 2017, between TPG Global, LLC and the Company

only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the

of action with respect to, or its or their ability to operate and/or retain,
one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent, the Company

the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer or
employee of another Person (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_
"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries,
fines and fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements, incurred in connection with any Action, arising out of or
pertaining to (i) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the decision of the Company Board to enter into this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement and the pendency and consummation of
the transactions and actions contemplated 

 



53  hereby) or (ii) the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or is
or was serving at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a
director, officer or employee of another Person, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time. In the event of any such Action, (A)
each Company Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses
incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation from the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of
receipt by the Surviving Corporation from the Company Indemnified Party of a
request therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that any person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by
the FBCA or the Company Charter or Company By-laws (in each case as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time), to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Surviving Corporation as authorized by the FBCA, (B) without limiting the
foregoing, each Company Indemnified Party may retain the Companys regularly
engaged independent legal counsel (provided that such engagement would not
create a conflict of interest under applicable rules of ethics) or other
counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Company
Indemnified Party as promptly as statements therefor are received, (C) the
Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Company Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Company Indemnified Party
from all liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation
or claim or such Company Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (D) Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall use their reasonable best efforts to
assist in the defense of any such matter.

 

(b) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Company
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Company assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.04_.

 

(c) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies for the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective current and former directors and officers who are currently covered
by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company, in either case, of not less than the
existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured
persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time (with insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M.
Best with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance), except that in no event shall the Surviving
Company be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect
of any one policy year more than 350% of the aggregate annual premium most
recently paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Company is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this _Section 6.04(c)_

 



54  for the Maximum Amount, then it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as
possible for the years within such six-year period for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Amount, in respect of each policy year within such
period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may,
at its option (following reasonable consultation with Parent), purchase a
"tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy and fiduciary
liability insurance policy for the Company and its current and former
directors, officers and employees who are currently covered by the directors
and officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained
by the Company, such tail to provide coverage in an amount not less than the
existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured
persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall the cost of any such tail
policy in respect of any one policy year exceed the Maximum Amount. The
Surviving Company shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the respective
articles of incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational or governing
documents of the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of Company Indemnified Parties for
periods prior to and including the Effective Time than are currently set forth
in the Company Charter and Company By-laws and the articles of incorporation,
bylaws, or similar organizational and governing documents of the Company
Subsidiaries.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.04_ (i) shall survive consummation
of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives,
and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract
or otherwise.

 

(f) From and after the Effective Time, Parent (i) shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their
respective terms, the covenants contained in this _Section 6.04_ and (ii)
shall guarantee the prompt payment of the obligations of the Surviving Company
and the Company Subsidiaries under this _Section 6.04_.

Section 6.05 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors, officers or
significant shareholders relating to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any Representative of
the Company shall compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any
such shareholder litigation, in each case unless Parent shall have consented
in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

Section 6.06 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions
of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
Company Common Stock) resulting from the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



55 Section 6.07 _Public Announcements_. Subject to  _Section 5.04_, and
unless and until an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred and has not
been rescinded, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing, and give each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall
not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to
such consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system. The Company and Parent agree that the initial press release
to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Nothing in this
_Section 6.07_ shall limit the ability of any party hereto to make internal
announcements to their respective employees that are consistent in all
material respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 6.08 _SEC Documents_. After the date of this Agreement and through
the Closing, the Company will promptly notify Parent of, and promptly provide
to Parent, any comment letters it receives from the SEC or its staff in
respect of any reports, schedules, forms statements and other documents
furnished or filed by the Company with the SEC.

ARTICLE VIII

_Termination, Amendment and Waiver_

Section 8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

 

(i) if the Merger is not consummated on or before April 30, 2018 (the "
_End Date_ ");  _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 8.01(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of
any provision of this Agreement shall have proximately caused the failure of
the Closing to be consummated by the End Date;

(ii) if the condition set forth in _Section 7.01(c)_ is not satisfied and
the Legal Restraint giving rise to such non-satisfaction shall have become
final and non-appealable; or

 

(iii) if the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at
the Company Shareholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof
at which the vote was taken.

(c) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub has breached any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement,
or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub has become
untrue, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in  _Section
7.02(a)_ or _Section 7.02(b)_, as the case may be, could not be satisfied as
of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this 

 



58   _Section 8.01(c)_ unless any such breach or failure to be true has not
been cured within 30 days after written notice by the Company to Parent
informing Parent of such breach or failure to be true, except that no cure
period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured
prior to the End Date; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.01(c)_ if the Company
is then in breach of this Agreement in a manner that would cause the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_ or _Section 7.03(b)_ not to be
satisfied;

 

(d) by the Company prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
but not after, in order to accept a Superior Proposal or in the event that an
Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred, in each case provided the Company
has complied in all material respects with its obligations set forth in
_Section 5.04(d)_ and _Section 5.04(e)_ and provided that the Company pays
the Termination Fee prior to or simultaneously with such termination (it being
understood that the Company may enter into a definitive written agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal simultaneously with such termination of this
Agreement);

(e) by the Company, if (i) all of the conditions set forth in  _Section
7.01_ and _Section 7.03_ have been and remain satisfied or waived (other than
delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than satisfaction
of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken
at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of being
satisfied at the time of such termination), (ii) the Company has irrevocably
notified Parent in writing that the Company is ready and willing to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the conditions in
_Section 7.02_ are satisfied or waived (other than satisfaction of those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of being satisfied at
the time of such termination), and (iii) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within two Business
Days following the Companys delivery of such notice;

(f) by Parent, if the Company has breached any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Company has become untrue, in each case,
such that the conditions set forth in _Section 7.03(a)_ or _Section
7.03(b)_, as the case may be, could not be satisfied as of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 8.01(f)_ unless any such breach or failure to be true has
not been cured within 30 days after written notice by Parent to the Company
informing the Company of such breach or failure to be true, except that no
cure period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured
prior to the End Date; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that Parent may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(f)_ if Parent is then
in breach of this Agreement in a manner that would cause the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.02(a)_ or  _Section 7.02(b)_ not to be satisfied; or

(g) by Parent, in the event that an Adverse Recommendation Change shall
have occurred.

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of
this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in _Section
8.01_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without
any liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
other than the final sentence of _Section 6.02_, the indemnification and
reimbursement obligations under _Section 5.06_, this _Section 8.02_,
_Section 8.03_ and _Article IX_ , which provisions 

 



59  shall survive such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.03(c), Section 9.07 and Section 9.12, that
no such termination shall relieve any party from any liability or damages for
fraud, willful misconduct or any willful breach of this Agreement (no such
termination shall relieve any party from liability for any damages (including
in the case (and for the benefit) of the Company, damages based on the
consideration that would have otherwise been payable to the Companys
shareholders if the Merger were consummated). For purposes of this Agreement,
"willful breach" means a breach that is a consequence of an act or omission
undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of, or
failure to take, such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or
constitute a material breach of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that
the failure of any party to consummate the Merger on the date required by
_Section 1.02_ after the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and
which are capable of being satisfied on the Closing Date, assuming for
purposes hereof that the date of termination is the Closing Date) have been
satisfied or waived shall constitute a willful breach by such party.

 

Section 8.03 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as specifically provided for
herein, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions are
consummated.

 

(a) The Company shall pay to Parent (or an Affiliate thereof designated by
Parent in writing) the Termination Fee if: 

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_
(Company Enters into Definitive Agreement for Superior Proposal or Company
Makes Adverse Recommendation Change) or Parent terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(g)_ (Company Makes Adverse Recommendation Change)
or pursuant to  _Section 8.01(f)_ in respect of the Companys failure to
have complied in all material respects with any of its agreements contained in
_Section 5.04_ (Company Breaches No Solicitation Provision); or

 

(ii) (A) after the date hereof an Alternative Proposal shall have been made
by a Person or Group and publicly disclosed or announced, or shall otherwise
become publicly known, or any Person or Group shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn) to make an
Alternative Proposal; (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.01(b)(i)_ (Lapse of Outside Date), _Section 8.01(b)(iii)_
(Failure to Obtain Company Shareholder Approval) or _Section 8.01(f)_ (other
than in respect of the Companys failure to have complied in all material
respects with any of its agreements contained in _Section 5.04_ (Company
Breaches No Solicitation Provision)); and (C) within 12 months of such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for any
Alternative Proposal, or consummates any Alternative Proposal; provided,
however, that for purposes of this _Section 8.03(a)(ii)_, the references to
"25%" in the definition of "Alternative Proposal" shall be deemed to be
references to "a majority".

 



60 Any Termination Fee due under this _Section 8.03(a)_ shall be paid by wire
transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of clause (i) above simultaneously
with any such termination and (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, on the
earlier of the date of entering into a definitive agreement providing for any
Alternative Proposal or the date of consummation of any Alternative Proposal.

 

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree (i) that the agreements contained in
this  _Section 8.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) that, without these agreements, the Parties would not
enter into this Agreement and (iii) as of the date of this Agreement, it
is difficult to estimate or ascertain the actual amount of damages Parent
would suffer as a result of any termination of this Agreement by the Company
in circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable pursuant to _Section
8.03(a)_, and the parties intend in such circumstances that the Termination
Fee would serve to compensate Parent for damages incurred in any such event,
and not to serve as punishment or penalty. If the Company fails to timely pay
the amount due pursuant to  _Section 8.03(a)_, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit, action or other proceeding that results in a
Judgment in its favor, the Company shall pay to Parent (x) its reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, action or other proceeding,
and (y) interest on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was
required to be made until the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the
prime interest rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such
interest begins accruing;  _provided_ that the maximum aggregate amount that
the Company shall be required to pay pursuant to clauses (x) and (y) (but, for
the avoidance of doubt, not pursuant to _Section 8.03(a)_ ), shall be
$5,000,000.

 

(c) The parties agree that, in the event that the Agreement is terminated
pursuant to and in accordance with  _Section 8.01_ and the Termination Fee
is payable and paid to Parent in accordance with this _Section 8.03_, the
receipt by Parent of the Termination Fee (together with any reimbursement owed
pursuant to  _Section 8.03(b)_), as applicable, shall be deemed to be the
sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and, upon payment of
the Termination Fee (together with any reimbursement owed pursuant to
_Section 8.03(b)_), as applicable, the Company (and the Company Related
Parties) shall have no further liability to Parent and Merger Sub under this
Agreement; including for any liability or damages for willful misconduct or
any willful breach of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this Agreement shall relieve any party from liability for fraud. In no event
shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

(d) The Company and the Company Related Parties shall have no
further remedy (monetary or otherwise) against any Parent Related Party
following any termination of this Agreement (apart from claims (i) against any
Parent Related Party that is party to, and solely pursuant to the terms of,
the Confidentiality Agreement, (ii) for indemnification or reimbursement
pursuant to _Section 5.06_ of this Agreement, (iii) as set forth in Section
9.12(c)(iv). The provisions of this _Section 8.03(d)_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Parent Related Party.

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at
any time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) after receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Law

 



61  requires further approval by the Companys shareholders without the further
approval of such shareholders, and (ii) except as provided above, no amendment
of this Agreement shall be submitted to be approved by the Companys
shareholders unless required by Law. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
8.04_, any amendment to this _Section 8.04_, _Section 9.09(b)_, _Section
9.11_ or _Section 9.13_ shall require prior written consent of the Debt
Financing Sources.

 

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties; (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement; (c) waive compliance with any
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement; or (d) waive the
satisfaction of any of the conditions contained in this Agreement. No
extension or waiver by the Company shall require the approval of
the Companys shareholders unless such approval is required by Law. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument

obligation pursuant to, in accordance with, and subject to the limitations
set forth in _Section 5_ of the Financing Letter and _Section 9.12(b)(ii)_
of this Agreement (or, solely in the case of _Section 9.12(c)(iv)_, in
connection with Parents obligation to pay money damages, subject to the
Parent Liability Cap), (iii) against the Fund with respect to the Funds
obligation to specifically perform its obligation to make an equity
contribution to Parent pursuant to the Financing Letter in accordance with
the terms thereunder when and if the conditions thereto have been satisfied
and the conditions in Section 7.01 and 7.02 of this Agreement are and remain
satisfied (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be
satisfied at Closing, but subject to such conditions being capable of being
satisfied at such time) and (iv) against certain Parent Related Parties with
respect to their obligations under, and pursuant to the terms of, the
Confidentiality Agreement (the claims described in clauses (i) through (iv)
against any of the Persons specified in clauses (i) through (iv) or any of
their respective permitted successors or assigns, collectively, the "
_Retained Claims_ "). The Parent Related Parties are intended third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 9.07(c)_.

Section 9.08 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, including all matters of
construction, validity and performance and any action or proceeding (whether
in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) arising out of this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Florida, without giving
effect to the rules of conflict of laws of such State or other jurisdiction
that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than
Florida.

Section 9.09 _Jurisdiction; Venue_.

 

(a) each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court located within
the State of Florida for the purpose of any suit, action or proceeding
(whether, in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) relating to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; and (c)
agrees that it will not bring any suit, action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts.

 



73 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each
of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or nature (whether in law or in equity)
(each, a " _Financing Source Action_ ") against any Debt Financing Source
(and/or any of their Affiliates, or their Affiliates officers, directors,
employees, controlling persons, advisors, agents, attorneys or
representatives) relating to this Agreement or the Debt Financing other than
in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the
appellate courts thereof). Any such Financing Source Action shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York,
without regard to the conflicts of law rules of the State of New York that
would result in the application of the laws of any other state.

Section 9.10 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST A
DEBT FINANCING SOURCE AND/OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
EMPLOYEES, CONTROLLING PERSONS, ADVISORS, AGENTS, ATTORNEYS
AND REPRESENTATIVES). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE
OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.10_.

 

Section 9.11 _Assignment_. No party hereto may assign, transfer or
encumber this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations
hereunder (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
approval of the other parties hereto, and any attempted assignment without
such prior written approval shall be void and without legal effect;
_provided_ that prior to the Closing, Parent or Merger Sub may assign (a) all
or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to an Affiliate or (b) all or
any of its rights, but not its obligations, to any parties providing the
Proposed Debt Financing pursuant to the terms hereof for the sole purpose of
creating a security interest herein or otherwise assigning as collateral in
respect of such Proposed Debt Financing, in the case of each of clauses (a)
and (b), if such assignment does not (i) affect the obligations of the Fund
under the Financing Letter or (ii) prevent, impair or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise impede the rights of the
shareholders of the Company under this Agreement. No assignment by any party
shall relieve such party of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
two immediately preceding sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and permitted assigns.

 



74 Section 9.12 _Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement, including the right of a party to cause the other parties
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. It
is agreed that the parties are entitled to enforce specifically the
performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to
in _Section 9.09_ without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby
waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert
that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to
Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary
damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is acknowledged and agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to specific performance of Parents and Merger
Subs obligations pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to (i) prevent
breaches of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub other than as it relates
to the right to cause the Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger
and (ii) cause the Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger, only
in the event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (A) all
of the conditions set forth in  _Section 7.01_ and _Section 7.03_ have been
satisfied and remain satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to their being capable
of satisfaction at the Closing), (B) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete
the Closing in accordance with _Section 1.02_ and (C) the Company has
irrevocably notified Parent in writing that it stands ready, willing and able
to consummate the Closing and that all of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.02_ have been satisfied or waived and remain satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to their being capable of satisfaction or waiver at the
Closing).

(c) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company hereby agrees (subject in each case to _Section 9.12(c)(iv)_ below)
that (apart from claims (i) against any Parent Related Party that is party to,
and solely pursuant to the terms of, the Confidentiality Agreement, (ii)
against the Fund for specific performance of its obligations under the
Financing Letter to fund its commitment thereunder in accordance with and
pursuant to the Financing Letter and (iii) for indemnification or
reimbursement pursuant to _Section 5.06_ or _Section 6.04_ of this
Agreement):

(i) Except as otherwise provided in  _Section 9.12(c)(iv)_, specific
performance shall be its (and any Company Related Partys) sole and exclusive
remedy against any Parent Related Party for any loss suffered as a result of
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the
failure of the Merger to be consummated or otherwise related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby;

 

(ii) [Reserved];

 



75 (iii) _Limitations on Liabilities_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein but subject to Section 9.12(c)(iv):

(A) The maximum aggregate liability of the Parent Related Parties for
damages or otherwise shall be limited to $624,704,000 (the " _Parent Liability
Cap_ "). In no event shall the Company or its Affiliates seek or permit to be
sought on behalf of the Company any damages or any other recovery, judgment
or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive
damages, from any Parent Related Party other than Parent in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that the
parties agree that subject to the terms and conditions of the Financing
Letter, the Fund shall, and the Company may cause the Fund to, provide funds
to Parent to the extent provided in the Financing Letter which shall in no
event exceed the Parent Liability Cap. The Company acknowledges and agrees
that it has no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall
attach to, in each case with respect to damages, any Parent Related Party
(other than Parent or Merger Sub to the extent provided in this Agreement),
through Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise, whether by or through attempted
piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company
veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub against
the Fund or any other Parent Related Party, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise, except for its rights to cause
the Fund (but not any other Parent Related Party (including any general
partner or managing member)) to fund to Parent its commitment to the extent
provided in the Financing Letter, subject to the terms and conditions thereof
including the Parent Liability Cap and the other limitations described
therein. Recourse against the Fund under the Financing Letter, subject to the
amount of the Parent Liability Cap shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
the Company and its Affiliates against the Fund and any other Parent Related
Party (other than Parent or Merger Sub to the extent provided in this
Agreement) in respect of any liabilities or obligations arising under, or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Company acknowledges that both Parent and Merger Sub are newly formed
companies and do not have any material assets except in connection with this
Agreement and the Financing Letter;

 

(B) The provisions of this _Section 9.12(c)(iii)_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Parent Related Party; and

(iv) Only if a court of competent jurisdiction referred to in Section 9.09
has declined, for any reason, to specifically enforce the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger pursuant to a claim for
specific performance brought against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, the Company may pursue a monetary damages remedy,
but in any

 



76  event subject to the Parent Liability Cap and _Section 9.12(c)(iii)_. If
such a court has granted an award of damages for such alleged breach against
Parent, the Company may enforce such award and accept damages for such
alleged breach, subject to the Parent Liability Cap and _Section
9.12(c)(iii)_, only if, within three (3) Business Days following such award,
Parent and Merger Sub have not consummated the Merger in accordance with the
terms set forth herein. If the Company pursues such an enforcement suit,
action or other proceeding that results in a Judgment in its favor, Parent
shall pay to the Company, (x) its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, action or other proceeding, and (y) interest
on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime interest
rate published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such interest begins
accruing;  _provided_ that the maximum aggregate amount that Parent shall be
required to pay pursuant to clauses (x) and (y), shall be $5,000,000. In
addition, the Company agrees to cause any legal action or proceeding still
pending to be dismissed with prejudice at such time as Parent and Merger Sub
consummate the Merger.

Section 9.13 _Exculpation of Debt Financing Sources_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Company Related
Party shall have any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise; _provided_ , that the foregoing will not limit the rights of
Parent or Merger Sub or any Parent Related Party in respect of the Debt
Financing (including under any commitment letter related thereto).

 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, no Debt Financing Source shall be
subject to any special, consequential, punitive or indirect damages or
damages of a tortious nature.

(c) Solely for purposes of _Section 9.13(a)_, "Company Related Party"
shall be deemed to include the Company and any Company Related Partys
respective affiliates and their and their respective affiliates stockholders,
partners, members, officers, directors, employees, controlling persons,
agents and representatives.
