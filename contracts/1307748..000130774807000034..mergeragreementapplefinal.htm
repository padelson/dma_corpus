among Apple Hospitality Five, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the "Company"),
Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Buyer") and
Inland American Orchard Hotels, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Acquisition
Sub") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Inland American Lodging Corporation, a
Delaware corporation which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Inland American
Lodging Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation which is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Buyer. Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the Company are each sometimes referred
to herein as a "Party" and collectively as the "Parties."

 

RECITALS

 

The Boards of Directors of Buyer and the Company have determined that it is
advisable and in the best interest of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the transactions described herein, pursuant to
which Acquisition Sub will merge with the Company and Acquisition Sub will be
the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") in such merger and
each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of the Company will be
converted into the right to receive cash as provided herein. As an inducement
to Buyer to enter this Agreement, each of the holders of Series B Convertible
Shares has entered into a voting agreement (the "Voting Agreement") pursuant
to which such Person has agreed, among other things, to vote the Series B
Convertible Shares held by such Person to approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Certain terms used herein shall have the
meanings assigned to them in Article IX.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1

 

 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and in accordance with the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the
"VSCA") and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Acquisition Sub
shall be merged (the "Merger") with the Company at the Effective Time (as
defined herein) in accordance with this Agreement and the Plan of Merger (the
"Plan of Merger") attached hereto as Exhibit A. Following the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Acquisition Sub
shall continue as the surviving corporation and shall succeed to and assume
all the rights and obligations of the Company in accordance with the VSCA and
DGCL.

 

Section 1.2

 

 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger will take place at a mutually agreeable

Section 1.3

 

 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, the Parties shall file
articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") executed in accordance with
Section 13.1-720 of the VSCA and a certificate of merger executed in
accordance with Section 252 of the DGCL, respectively, and shall make all
other filings or recordings required under the VSCA and the DGCL,
respectively, to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as a Certificate of Merger for the Merger has been issued by the State
Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia and a certification
page has been issued by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at
such later time as Acquisition Sub and the Company shall specify in the
Articles of Merger (the time and the day the Merger becomes effective being,
respectively, the "Effective Time" and the "Effective Date"), it being
understood that the Parties shall cause the Effective Time to occur on the
Closing Date. 

 

Section 1.4

 

 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
VSCA and DGCL.

 

Section 1.5

 

 _Charter and By-Laws_. The Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of
Acquisition Sub, in each case as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall become the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time of the Merger. 

 

Section 1.6

 

 _Directors_. The directors of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

Section 1.7

 

 _Officers_. The officers of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

ARTICLE II 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
 OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 

Section 2.1

 

 _Effect on Capital Stock_. 

 

(a)

 

By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of
any outstanding capital stock of the Company, at the Effective Time:

 

(i)

 

each Share (other than Shares which are Dissenting Shares (as defined herein))
shall be converted into the right to receive $14.05 in cash (the "Merger
Consideration") per Share without any interest thereon; and

 

(ii)

 

all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired.

 


  

 



 

2

 



 



 



 



 

(b)

 

By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of
any Company Option, each such option shall be cancelled at the Effective Time
in exchange for a cash payment by the Company to be made on the Closing Date
of an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the number of Units subject
to such option and (ii) the difference between $14.05 and the per Unit
exercise price set forth in such option. 

 

(c)

 

By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each share of common stock, $.01 par value, of Acquisition Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
converted into and thereafter represent one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable common share, $.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation, so
that thereafter Buyer will be the sole and exclusive owner of the outstanding
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.2

 

 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a)

 

 _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall enter into a Paying
Agent Agreement, in form and reasonably satisfactory to the Company, with
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, or such other bank or trust company
that Buyer and the Company agree to (the "Paying Agent"), pursuant to which
the Paying Agent shall act as paying agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration for the issued and outstanding Shares.

 

(b)

 

 _Provision of Shares_. Buyer shall provide (i) to the Paying Agent on or
before the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Shares,
sufficient cash to be paid for the issued and outstanding Shares pursuant to
Section 2.1 and (ii) to the Company on or before the Effective Time sufficient
cash to enable the Company to pay all amounts payable pursuant to Section
2.1(b) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation
Fund").

 

(c)

 

 _Exchange Procedures_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall mail
to each holder of record of outstanding Shares a letter of transmittal (which
shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Buyer and the Company may
reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time) to be used for surrendering
Shares for payment of the Merger Consideration.

 

(d)

 

 _No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Capital Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid upon surrender of each Share in accordance with the terms
of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to Shares, subject, however, to the obligation of Buyer
to pay, without interest and not more than 60 days following the Effective
Time, any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior
to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the Company on
such shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the
date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time and have
not been paid prior to such surrender, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Shares
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(e)

 

 _No Liability_. None of Buyer, Acquisition Sub, the Company or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. Any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to
the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement that remains unclaimed for 12
months after the Effective Time shall be redelivered by the Paying Agent to
Buyer, upon demand, and any holders of Shares which have not been surrendered
as contemplated by Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to Buyer for
delivery of the Merger Consideration, subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat and other similar laws. Any portion of the Surviving
Corporation Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date that is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Body shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
None of Buyer, the Company, Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of Shares for any such Shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

(f)

 

 _Withholding Rights_. Buyer or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as Buyer or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Buyer or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Shares, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Buyer or the Paying Agent.

 

(g)

 

 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, holders of Shares who have properly exercised, perfected and not
subsequently withdrawn or lost their dissenters rights with respect thereto
in accordance with Article 15 of the VSCA (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not
have any of such Shares converted into the right to receive, or become
exchangeable for, the Merger Consideration. The holders of such Shares shall
be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of such Article 15 of the VSCA unless and until such
holders fail to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their
dissenters rights under Article 15 of the VSCA. If, after the Effective
Time, any such holder fails to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such right, each of such holders Shares shall thereupon be treated as if
it had been converted into the right to receive, and become exchangeable for,
at the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, as
provided in Section 2.1 hereof. Buyer shall be responsible for all payments
to be made under such Article 15 of the VSCA in respect of Dissenting Shares.

ARTICLE III 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

Section 3.1

 

 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. The Company represents and
warrants to Buyer as follows:

 

(a)

 

 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power of the Company_. The Company is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of Virginia and has the requisite corporate power and authority to carry
on its business as now being conducted. The Company is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business or the ownership, operations or leasing of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually
or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as
defined herein). For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Material Adverse
Effect" shall mean, any circumstances, developments, effect, event, or change
that is materially adverse to the business, properties, assets, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
(as defined herein), on a consolidated basis taken as a whole, other than
circumstance, development, effects, events or changes arising out of or
resulting from (a) changes in conditions in the United States or global
economy or capital or financial markets generally, including changes in
interest or exchange rates, (b) changes in general legal, regulatory,
political, economic or business conditions or changes in GAAP (as defined
herein) that, in each case, generally affect the hospitality industry, (c) the
negotiation, execution, announcement or performance of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
impact thereof on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with customers,
suppliers, licensors, distributors, lenders, partners or employees, (d) acts
of war, sabotage or terrorism, or any escalation or worsening of any such acts
of war, sabotage or terrorism threatened or underway as of the date of this
Agreement or (e) earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural disasters. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Company Subsidiary" shall mean any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture or other legal entity of
which the Company (either directly or through or together with another Company
Subsidiary) owns any capital stock or other equity interests of such entity.

 

(b)

 

 _The Company Subsidiaries_. Schedule 3.1(b) to the Company Disclosure Letter
(as defined herein) sets forth each Company Subsidiary and the ownership
interest therein of the Company. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(b) to
the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) all the outstanding shares of capital stock
of each Company Subsidiary that is a corporation have been validly issued, are
fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company, by another Company
Subsidiary or by the Company and another Company Subsidiary, free and clear of
all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests of
any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens") and (ii) all equity
interests in each Company Subsidiary that is a partnership or limited
liability company are owned by the Company, by another Company Subsidiary or
by the Company and another Company Subsidiary, free and clear

of all Liens. Each Company Subsidiary that is a corporation is duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on its business as now being conducted and each Company
Subsidiary that is a partnership or limited liability company is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite power and authority to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Each Company Subsidiary is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership, operation
or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except for interests in the Company Subsidiaries, neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns directly or indirectly any capital
stock or other equity interest in any Person.

 

(c)

 

 _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
200,000,000 common shares, no par value (the "Common Shares"), 200,000,000
Series A Preferred Shares, no par value (the "Series A Preferred Shares" and
together with the Common Shares, the "Units"), 240,000 Series B Convertible
Preferred Shares, no par value (the "Series B Convertible Shares") and
15,000,000 other preferred shares (the "Other Preferred Shares"). On the date
hereof, (i) 45,320,278 Common Shares, 45,320,278 Series A Preferred Shares,
240,000 Series B Convertible Shares and no Other Preferred Shares were issued
and outstanding, (ii) 2,708,409 Units were available for issuance under the

2,907,415 Common Shares for a total of 48,227,693 Shares outstanding.
Schedule 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter is a true and complete list,
as of the date hereof, of all outstanding options under the Stock Incentive
Plans, the number of Units subject to each such option, the exercise price,
date of grant and the names and addresses of holders thereof. On the date of
this Agreement, except as set forth above in this Section 3.1(c), no shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of the Company were issued, reserved
for issuance or outstanding. All outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
not subject to preemptive rights. Except (A) for the Series A Preferred
Shares, the Series B Convertible Shares and the Company Options, (B) as set
forth in Schedule 3.1(c) to the Company Disclosure Letter, and (C) as
otherwise permitted under Section 4.1, there are no outstanding securities,
options, stock appreciation rights, warrants, calls, rights, commitments,
agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which such entity is bound, obligating
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to
be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock, voting
securities or other ownership interests of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue,
grant, extend or enter into any such

security, option, warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or
undertaking.

 

(d)

 

 _Authority; Noncontravention; Consents_. 

 

(i)

 

The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and, subject to approval of the Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby by the affirmative vote, in each case as a
separate voting group, of (i) a majority of the outstanding Common Shares,
(ii) more than two-thirds of the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares, (iii)
more than two-thirds of the outstanding Series B Convertible Shares, and (iv)
a majority of the total of the (x) outstanding Common Shares plus (y) Common
Shares represented by the Series B Convertible Shares voting on an as-
converted basis (the "Company Shareholder Approval"), to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate such transactions, subject to receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes valid and binding obligations of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws
relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity.

 

(ii)

 

Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(d) to the Company Disclosure Letter, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and compliance by the
Company with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration of any material obligation or loss of a material benefit under,
or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, (i) the Articles of Incorporation
or By-laws of the Company or the comparable charter or organizational
documents or partnership or similar agreement (as the case may be) of any
Company Subsidiary, each as amended or supplemented to the date of this
Agreement, (ii) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
lease, franchise agreement, license agreement or other agreement or instrument
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or their respective
properties or assets (it being understood that no representation is being
given as to whether the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary will be in
compliance with any financial covenants contained therein following the
Merger) or (iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters
referred to in the following sentence, any judgment, order, decree, statute,

 


  

 



 

7

 



 



 



 



 

law, ordinance, rule or regulation (collectively, "Laws") applicable to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or their respective properties or assets,
other than, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii), any such conflicts,
violations, defaults, rights or Liens that, individually or in the aggregate
would not (y) have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (z) reasonably be
expected to prevent the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(iii)

 

No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration
or filing with, any federal, state or local government or any court,
administrative or regulatory agency or commission or other governmental
authority or agency (a "Governmental Entity"), is required by or with respect
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company
of any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for (i) the
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of (y) the
preliminary and definitive proxy materials relating to the shareholders
meeting (the "Company Shareholders Meeting") for the Company Shareholder
Approval (such proxy materials, as amended or supplemented from time to time,
the "Proxy Statement"), and (z) such reports under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as may be required in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) the filing of Articles of Merger with the State
Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, (iii) such filings with Governmental Entities
to satisfy the applicable requirements of the laws of states in which the
Company and any Company Subsidiary are qualified or licensed to do business,
and (iv) such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations and filings (A) as are set forth in Schedule
3.1(d) to the Company Disclosure Letter or (B) which, if not obtained or made,
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e)

 

 _SEC Documents; Financial Statements_. 

 

(i)

 

The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1,
2003 (as amended through the date hereof, the "Company SEC Documents"). All
of the Company SEC Documents (other than preliminary material), as of their
respective filing dates, complied in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")
or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Documents. None of the Company
SEC Documents at the time of filing, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the

 


  

 



 

8

 



 



 



 



 

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent
such statements have been modified or superseded by later filed the Company
SEC Documents. 

 

(ii)

 

The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company
SEC Documents (including the related notes) complied as to form, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto (including, without limitation, Regulation S-X),
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States ("GAAP") (except, in the case of interim financial
statements, as permitted by Forms 10-Q or 8-K of the SEC) applied on a
consistent basis during the periods and at the dates involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented, in accordance with
the applicable requirements of GAAP, the consolidated financial condition of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, as of the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of interim financial statements, to
notes and normal year-end adjustments). The Company has no Company Subsidiary
which is not consolidated for accounting purposes. 

 

(f)

 

 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in the Company
SEC Documents or in Schedule 3.1(f) to the Company Disclosure Letter, since
December 31, 2006 (the "Company Financial Statement Date") and through the
date of this Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary course and there
has not been (a) any change in the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, that
has resulted or would result, individually or in the aggregate, in a Company
Material Adverse Effect, nor has there been any occurrence or circumstance

Documents or in Schedule 3.1(g) to the Company Disclosure Letter, and other
than personal injury and other routine tort litigation arising from the
ordinary course of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
which is covered by adequate insurance, there is no suit, action, Order or

affecting the Company or any Company Subsidiary that, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to (i) have a Company Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) prevent the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary having, or which, insofar as

(h)

 

 _Taxes_.

 

(i)

 

Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary has timely filed all material
Tax Returns (as defined herein) and reports required to be filed by it (after
giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental
Entity having authority to do so). Each such Tax Return is true, correct and
complete in all material respects. The Company and each Company Subsidiary
have paid (or the Company has paid on their behalf), within the time and
manner prescribed by law, all material Taxes (as defined herein) reflected on
each such Tax Return. For purposes of this Agreement, "Taxes" shall mean any
federal, state, local or foreign income, gross receipts, license, payroll,
employment withholding, property, sales, excise or other tax or governmental
charges of any nature whatsoever, together with any penalties, interest or
additions thereto and "Tax Return" shall mean any return, declaration, report,
claim for refund, or information return or statement relating to Taxes,
including any schedule or attachment thereto, and including any amendment
thereof. 

 

(ii)

 

The Company (A) for all of its taxable years commencing with the year ending
December 31, 2003 through the most recent December 31, has been subject to
taxation as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Code within the
meaning of Section 856 of the Code and has satisfied the requirements to
qualify as a REIT for such years, (B) has operated, and intends to continue to
operate, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for its tax year ending
December 31, 2007 or ending upon Closing if earlier, and (C) has not taken or
omitted to take any action which could reasonably be expected to result in a
challenge to its status as a REIT, and, to the Companys Knowledge, no such
challenge is pending or threatened. Each Company Subsidiary which is a
partnership or that files Tax Returns as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes has, since inception, been classified for federal income tax purposes
as a partnership and not as a corporation or as an association taxable as a
corporation.

been asserted against it.

 

(iv)

 

The Company does not have any earnings and profits attributable to the Company
or any other corporation for any non-REIT year within the meaning of Section
857 of the Code.

 

(v)

 

Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any payments, or is
obligated to make any payments, or is a party to an agreement that could

not been filed.

 

(vi)

 

Except as disclosed in Schedule 3.1(h)(vi) to the Company Disclosure Letter,
the most recent financial statements contained in the Company SEC Documents
filed prior to the date hereof reflect an adequate reserve (excluding any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) for all Taxes payable by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of
such financial statements, except for failures to reflect an adequate reserve
that would not cause a Company Material Adverse Effect. Taxes payable by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries on the Closing Date will not exceed such
reserve in any material respects as adjusted through the Closing Date in
accordance with the past custom and practice of any of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns. True and complete copies of
all federal Tax Returns that have been filed with the IRS by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary with respect to the taxable years commencing on or after
January 1, 2002, have been provided or made available to representatives of
Buyer prior to the date hereof. None of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries has executed or filed with the IRS or any other Taxing Authority
any agreement, waiver or other document or arrangement extending the period
for assessment or collection of material Taxes (including any applicable
statute of limitation), which waiver or extension is currently in effect, and,

Company Subsidiaries have been fully paid, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no other material audits, examinations or other proceedings
relating to any Taxes of the Company and the Company

 


  

 



 

11

 



 



 



 



 

Subsidiaries by any Taxing Authority in progress. Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.1(h)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any Taxing
Authority that it intends to conduct such an audit, examination or other
proceeding in respect of material Taxes or make any assessment for material
Taxes. To the Knowledge of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, no
audit, examination, or other proceeding is threatened. None of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries is a party to any material litigation or pending
litigation or administrative proceeding relating to Taxes.

jurisdiction, and to the Knowledge of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, no such claim is threatened.

 

(x)

 

None of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is a party to any Tax sharing
or similar agreement or arrangement pursuant to which it could have any
obligations after the Closing. There are no Encumbrances for Taxes (other
than Taxes not yet due and payable for which adequate reserves have been made
in accordance with GAAP) upon any of the assets of any of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. There is no Tax Protection Agreement currently in force
and, as of the date of this Agreement, no Person has raised in writing, or to
the Knowledge of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, threatened to
raise, a claim against any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any
breach of any Tax Protection Agreement. None of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries is a party to any understanding or arrangement described in
Section 6662(d)(2)(C)(ii) of the Code or Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b) or is a material advisor as defined in Section 6111(b) of the
Code. None of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has entered into any

the management companies for the Companys properties own and/or possess all
permits, licenses, variances, authorizations, exemptions, orders,
registrations and approvals of all Governmental Entities (the "Permits") which

referred to above is, and since January 1, 2004, has been, in compliance in
all material respects with the terms of the Permits and all such Permits are

tender offer or exchange offer for 35% or more of the outstanding shares of

obligations under Applicable Law:

the Company may, in response to an unsolicited request therefor, participate
in discussions or negotiations with, or furnish information with respect to
