Subsidiaries to waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with Debevoise&nbsp;&amp; Plimpton LLP representing Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer, the Transferred Companies or the
transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, all communications involving attorney-client confidences between Seller, its Subsidiaries, the Transferred Companies and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and such Outside Counsel or
internal counsel of Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, in the course of the negotiation, documentation, preparation, execution, delivery and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or any dispute or proceeding arising
under or in connection with this Agreement (including in any claim for indemnification brought by Buyer), shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Transferred Companies).
Accordingly, the Transferred Companies shall not have access to any such communications or to the files of such Outside Counsel or such internal counsel relating to such engagement from and after the Closing and none of Buyer, the Transferred
Companies or any Person acting or purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer or the Transferred Companies shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege attaching to such communications belongs to Buyer or the
Transferred Companies. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing, (<U>a</U>)&nbsp;Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Transferred Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and none of the Transferred Companies shall be a holder thereof, (<U>b</U>)&nbsp;to the extent that files of such Outside Counsel or such internal counsel in respect of such engagement constitute property of the client,
only Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Transferred Companies) shall hold such property rights and (<U>c</U>)&nbsp;such Outside Counsel or such internal counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to the Transferred Companies by reason of any attorney-client relationship between such Outside Counsel or such internal counsel and the Transferred Companies or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
