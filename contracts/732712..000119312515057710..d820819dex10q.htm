2.4 _Nonassignability of Assets_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to
the extent that the conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery or attempted

Companies, as the case may be, of any asset that would be a Transferred Asset
(including an Assigned Contract) or Excluded Asset, as applicable, or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom (and
the subsequent acquisition of Newco by Buyer) is prohibited by any applicable
Law or would result in a violation or breach of Contract, or would require any
Governmental Authorizations or third-party authorizations, approvals,
consents or waivers, and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers
have not been obtained, or such violation or breach has not been cured, prior
to the Closing (other than for Federal Government Contracts, which will
transfer at the Closing subject to a subsequent Federal Government Contract
novation) (the " _Unassigned Assets_ "), the Closing shall proceed without the
conveyance, transfer, assignment or delivery of such asset and there shall be
no adjustment to the Purchase Price. The parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts for six (6) months following the Closing (other than for
Federal Government Contracts, for which there will be no six (6) month limit
on the parties obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
Federal Government novation), and cooperate with each other, to obtain
promptly such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers or cure any such
violation or breach; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of Seller or its
Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any
consideration therefor, other than filing, recordation or similar fees and,
_provided_ , _further_ , that the parties shall not be required to seek any

 



24  authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers or cure any such violation or
breach under Non-Scheduled Contracts. Seller shall not authorize or enter into
any agreement or commitment with respect to obtaining any such
authorizations, approvals, consents, novations or waivers or curing any such
violation or breach that would impose an additional obligation or burden on
the Transferred Business without Buyers prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Pending such
authorization, approval, consent, novation or waiver, or the cure of any such
violation or breach, and subject to _Section 6.17_, the parties shall
cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable and lawful
arrangements designed to assert any rights under such Unassigned Asset or yet
to be novated Federal Government Contract (and Seller shall keep Buyer
reasonably informed with respect to material changes to any such Unassigned
Asset) and provide ( _a_ ) to the intended transferee the benefits of use,
burdens and obligations of such Unassigned Asset or yet to be novated Federal
Government Contract and ( _b_ ) to the intended transferor the benefits that
they would have obtained had the Unassigned Asset been conveyed at the Closing
and relief from all Liabilities associated with such Unassigned Asset or yet
to be novated Federal Government Contract. Once authorization, approval,
consent or waiver for the conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery of any
such Unassigned Asset not conveyed, transferred, assigned, or delivered at the
Closing is obtained, or such violation or breach is cured, Seller or Buyer,
as applicable, shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary or Subsidiaries
to, convey, transfer and deliver such Unassigned Asset to the intended
transferee for no additional cost (other than any applicable Transfer
Taxes for which Buyer shall be responsible in accordance with _Section
6.5(e)_ hereof), and such Unassigned Asset shall thereafter be deemed to be a
Transferred Asset or Excluded Asset, as applicable.

 

(b) To the extent that any such Unassigned Asset or unnovated Federal
Government Contract cannot be transferred or the full benefits of use of any
such Unassigned Asset or unnovated Federal Government Contract cannot be
provided to the intended transferee following the Closing pursuant to this
_Section 2.4_ (including with respect to Non-Scheduled Contracts), then Buyer
and Seller or the applicable Subsidiary shall enter into such arrangements
(including subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide to the
parties hereto the operational equivalent, to the extent permitted, of
obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or waiver, and the
performance by the intended transferee of the obligations thereunder. Seller
or Buyer, as applicable, shall hold in trust for and pay to the other party
promptly upon receipt thereof, all income, proceeds and other monies received
by such party or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with its use of any
Unassigned Asset or unnovated Federal Government Contract in connection with
the arrangements under this _Section 2.4_. Buyer or Seller, as applicable,

under this _Section 2.4_. Obligations pursuant to this _Section 2.4(b)_ with
respect to any such Unassigned Asset or unnovated Federal Government
Contract shall continue for the duration of the term of such Unassigned Asset
or unnovated Federal Government Contract and, for the avoidance of doubt,
neither party nor their Subsidiaries may extend or renew the term of an
Unassigned Asset or unnovated Federal Government Contract or exercise any
option for such extension or renewal. Further, to the extent a party is
required to give notice of intent not to renew or extend any term of an
Unassigned Asset or unnovated Federal Government Contract at the end of a
current term, such party may provide such notice in accordance with the terms
and conditions of such underlying asset. This _Section 2.4_ shall be subject
to the treatment of Contracts addressed in _Section 6.13_ and  _Section
6.17_.

 



25 2.5 _Transfer Documentation_. The transfers of Transferred Assets and Excluded
Assets, and the assumption of Assumed Liabilities and Excluded Liabilities,

attached as _Annex 2.5_ to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
transfer to Seller and its Affiliates of the Intellectual Property owned by
the Transferred Companies prior to the Closing, and the license to the
Transferred Companies from Seller and its Affiliates of certain Intellectual

applicable Subsidiaries) shall enter into a lease, sublease or other
occupancy agreement governing each Shared Location (each, a " _Shared Location
Lease_ ") in accordance with the terms of _Seller Schedule 2.6_. To the
extent that the consent of a third-party landlord is necessary for a Shared
Location Lease and such consent is not obtained, such Shared Location shall be
subject to _Section 2.4_. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to identify any
property that is used both in the Transferred Business and in the Seller

Reorganization) statement of Net Working Capital (" _Estimated Net Working
Capital_ ") and Net Debt (" _Estimated Net Debt_ "), which statement will be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied in a manner consistent with the
preparation of the Newco Financial Statements and in accordance with the
principles, policies and methodologies set forth in _Exhibit F_ attached
hereto (collectively, the " _Working Capital Principles_ "). If there is a
conflict between GAAP, applied in a manner consistent with the Newco Financial
Statements, and _Exhibit F_ , then _Exhibit F_ shall prevail. The process
described in this _Section 3.6_ is not intended to permit the introduction
of different accounting methodologies, classification, practices, estimation
techniques, assumptions and principles to the preparation of the Estimated
Closing Statement or the Final Closing Statement from those used in the
preparation of the balance sheet as of December 31, 2013 included in the
Newco Financial Statements, except as may be expressly provided for in the
definitions set forth herein and in _Exhibit F_ attached hereto. The statement
prepared in accordance with the foregoing is referred to as the " _Estimated
Closing Statement_ ". Seller shall also prepare and deliver to Buyer a
worksheet showing the difference, if any, between the Estimated Net Working
Capital and the Net Working Capital Threshold. The amount, if any, by which
the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Threshold is
referred to herein as the " _Estimated Buyer Working Capital Payment_ ". The
amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital Threshold exceeds the
Estimated Net Working Capital is referred to herein as the " _Estimated Seller
Working Capital Payment_ ".

 

(b) _Audit Adjustment Amount_. If upon delivery to Buyer of the Audited 2014
Financial Statements pursuant to  _Section 6.18(a)(i)_, the total revenues
of the Transferred Business reflected in the Audited 2014 Financial Statements
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014 (the " _Audited 2014 Revenue
Amount_ ") is less than the amount set forth on _Schedule 3.6(b)(1)_ , then
the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the dollar amount equal to the
product of (x) _5.9_ _multiplied_ by (y) 0.41 _multiplied_ by (z) the dollar
amount by which the Audited 2014 Revenue Amount is less than the amount set
forth on _Schedule 3.6(b)(2)_. The " _Audit_

 



28   _Adjustment Amount_ " shall be either: (i) such product, if the Audited
2014 Revenue Amount is less than the amount set forth on _Schedule 3.6(b)(1)_
; or (ii) zero dollars ($0), if the Audited 2014 Revenue Amount is not less
than the amount set forth on _Schedule 3.6(b)(1)_.

(c) Seller shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, no later than sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, a statement of Net Working Capital and Net Debt
of the Transferred Business as of the Effective Time, which statement (the "
_Final Closing Statement_ ") will be prepared in accordance with the Working
Capital Principles, together with a worksheet showing the difference, if any,
between ( _i_ ) the Net Working Capital shown on the Final Closing Statement
(the " _Final Net Working Capital_ ") and the Estimated Net Working Capital
and (ii) the Net Debt shown on the Final Closing Statement (the " _Final Net
Debt_ ") and the Estimated Net Debt. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall provide Seller and its authorized representatives with reasonable
access during business hours on reasonable notice to the Transferred Business,
including the Transferred Books and Records, and other information that may
reasonably relate to the Final Closing Statement as Seller shall from time to
time reasonably request in writing.

(d) For thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Final Closing
Statement, Buyer shall have the right to object thereto or any portion thereof
(it being agreed that the only permitted reasons for objections shall be
mathematical error or the failure to prepare the Final Closing Statement or
compute items set forth therein in accordance with this _Section 3.6_,
including any failure of the Final Closing Statement or any items set forth
therein to adhere to the Working Capital Principles). Any objection made by
Buyer shall be accompanied by materials showing in reasonable detail Buyers
support for its position or a reasonable basis for why it lacks sufficient
information on which to make such an objection. Buyer shall be deemed to have
waived any rights to object to the Final Closing Statement, unless Buyer
furnishes its written objections, together with supporting materials, to
Seller within such thirty (30) day period. Within thirty (30) days after
Sellers receipt of Buyers objection to the Final Closing Statement, Buyer
and Seller shall meet to resolve any differences in their respective positions
with respect to the Final Closing Statement. Each party shall provide the
other party supporting documentation and make their respective
representatives reasonably available to answer questions as to their
respective positions with respect to the Final Closing Statement. If Buyer and
Seller are unable to agree on the Final Closing Statement within ninety (90)
days after Sellers receipt of Buyers written objections, then
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be appointed to resolve any remaining
disagreements. If such mutually selected accounting firm is not willing and
able to serve in such capacity, then Seller shall deliver to Buyer a list of
three (3) other accounting firms of recognized national standing in the United
States and Buyer shall select one (1) of such three (3) accounting firms
(PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or such firm as is ultimately selected pursuant
to the aforementioned procedures being the " _Accountant_ "). Buyer and Seller
shall execute any agreement reasonably required by the Accountant for its
engagement hereunder. The Accountant, acting as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, shall be charged with determining as promptly as practicable, but
in any event within thirty (30) days after the date on which such dispute is
referred to the Accountant, whether Final Net Working Capital, Final Net Debt
and the Final Closing Statement were prepared in accordance with this
Agreement, including the Working Capital Principles, and (only with respect to
the disagreements as to the items set forth in the notice of disagreement and
submitted to the Accountant and any other items affected by the resolution of
those disputed items, and in all instances, the Accountants determinations
must be within the range of the amounts asserted by 

 



29  Buyer and Seller) whether and to what extent, if any, Final Net Working
Capital, Final Net Debt and the Final Closing Statement require adjustment.
The Accountant shall allocate its costs and expenses between Buyer and Seller
based upon the percentage of the contested amount submitted to the Accountant
that is ultimately awarded to Buyer on the one hand or Seller on the other
hand, such that Buyer bears a percentage of such costs and expenses equal to
the percentage of the contested amount awarded to Seller and Seller bears a
percentage of such costs and expenses equal to the percentage of the contested
amount awarded to Buyer. If there is no timely objection as provided
above, the Final Closing Statement as determined by Seller shall be binding
and final for purposes of this Agreement. If there is a timely objection as
provided above, the determination of the Accountant shall be binding and final
for purposes of this Agreement.

(e) The amount equal to the Final Net Working Capital minus the Estimated Net
Working Capital shall be referred to as the " _Working Capital Difference_ "
and the amount equal to the Final Net Debt minus the Estimated Net Debt shall
be referred to as the " _Net Debt Difference_ ". Within two (2) Business Days
following the final determination of the Final Closing Statement, whether by
agreement between Buyer and Seller or as set forth in _Section 3.6(b)_, ( _x_
) Buyer shall pay to GTE an amount equal to the Working Capital Difference, if
the Working Capital Difference is a positive number, and Seller shall pay (or
cause GTE to pay) to Buyer an amount equal to the absolute value of the
Working Capital Difference, if the Working Capital Difference is a negative
number, and ( _y_ ) Seller shall pay (or cause GTE to pay) to Buyer an amount
equal to the Net Debt Difference, if the Net Debt Difference is a positive
number, and Buyer shall pay to GTE an amount equal to the absolute value of
the Net Debt Difference, if the Net Debt Difference is a negative number.
Such amount shall be paid, in immediately available funds, together with
interest thereon calculated pursuant to the penultimate sentence of this
_Section 3.6(e)_, pursuant to the instructions previously delivered by Buyer
or GTE, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate of the
respective amounts to be paid (if any) by Seller or GTE, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, under the preceding two sentences shall, if
payable at the same time, be netted against each other and the party with the
positive net payment obligation shall pay such net obligation amount. Any
payment under this _Section 3.6(e)_ shall accrue interest at the rate of 200
basis points per annum above the "prime rate" as of the Closing Date as
announced by Bank of America, N.A. (or any successor thereto) from the Closing
Date to the date of payment. Any payment made pursuant to this _Section
3.6(e)_ shall, for tax purposes, be deemed to be an adjustment to the
consideration payable to GTE.

3.7 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The parties have agreed that the purchase
and sale of the limited liability company interests of Newco shall be treated
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as an acquisition by Buyer, and a sale by
Seller, of all of the assets of Newco and that the purchase and sale of the
limited liability company interests of Newco will be treated as an "applicable
asset acquisition" within the meaning of Section 1060 of the Code. Within
ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
draft allocation schedule, prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code, allocating the Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities (to the extent
treated as liabilities for federal income tax purposes) among the assets
of Newco (including, for purposes of this _Section 3.7_, the stock of the
Section 338(h)(10) Companies and the assets of any Subsidiary of Newco that is
treated as a flow-through-entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes) (the "
_Allocation Schedule_ "). If Seller believes that all or a portion of the
Allocation Schedule is incorrect and Seller notifies Buyer in a

 



30  writing including a description of the objection and basis supporting
Sellers objections and any calculations or documentation that support the
objection, within 30 (thirty) days after having received such Allocation
Schedule, Buyer and Seller agree to consult and resolve in good faith any such
disputed item. In the event the parties are unable to resolve any such dispute
within 30 (thirty) days following notice to Buyer of Sellers objection (in
the form and within the time set forth herein), the Accountant will be
retained to resolve solely any issue in dispute as promptly as possible and
the determination of the Accountant shall be final with respect to
such disputed issues. Buyer and Seller shall then be bound by the Allocation
Schedule, as adjusted to reflect the determination, if any, of the Accountant.
The costs of the Accountant shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. In the
event that Final Net Working Capital is determined, or another adjustment to
the Purchase Price for tax reporting purposes is made under this Agreement or
the Employee Matters Agreement, after delivery of the Allocation Schedule,
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to revise such schedule to take into account
the portion of such Final Net Working Capital or such other adjustment to the
Purchase Price allocable to the assets of Newco. The Allocation Schedule, as
finally determined, shall be used in preparing IRS Form 8883 and each of
Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer on the other hand, shall report the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and file all Tax Returns, in each
case, for federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes in accordance
with the Allocation Schedule, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section
3.7_.

3.8 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any
party making a payment under this Agreement shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable hereunder, or other payment otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement, the amounts required to be deducted and
withheld under the Code, or any provision of any U.S. federal, state, local or
foreign Tax law, _provided_ , _however_ , that if either party becomes aware
that any amount is required to be so withheld, it shall promptly notify the
other party of any such required withholding and the parties shall cooperate
with each other in good faith (including by taking all reasonable actions
requested by the other party to the extent such actions would not reasonably
be expected to have an adverse impact on the requested party) to minimize or
eliminate such withholding Taxes. Any amounts so withheld shall be paid over
to the appropriate Governmental Entity. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

4.10 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) As used in this Agreement, " _Seller Benefit Plans_ " means all ( _i_ )
"employee benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ") and ( _ii_ )
all other incentive, profit-sharing, stock option, stock purchase, other
equity-based compensation, employment, compensation, vacation or other leave,
change in control, retention, supplemental retirement, severance, health,
medical, disability, life insurance, welfare, deferred compensation, fringe
benefit and other employee compensation and benefit plans, programs,
practices and agreements, written or oral, in each case established,
maintained or contributed to, by Seller or any of its Affiliates and ( _x_ )
that will (or will be required to) be established, maintained or contributed
to, by Buyer on the Closing Date as provided herein, ( _y_ ) with respect to
which any Business Employee is (or will be) entitled to any benefit, or ( _z_
) with respect to which any Transferred Company has any liability. As used in
this 

 



37  Agreement, the term " _Business Employees_ " means ( _i_ ) all active Listed
Employees who are employees of the Transferred Companies immediately prior to
the Closing and ( _ii_ ) all Listed Employees who immediately prior to the
Closing are on maternity or paternity leave, educational leave, short-term
disability, military leave with veterans reemployment rights under federal
law, leave under the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, or any other approved
leave of absence, or are union represented employees who have been laid off
and have a right to recall that has not expired, but in either case, excluding
all Retained Employees. The Seller Benefit Plans are set forth on _Seller
Schedule 4.10(a)(i)_, and those Seller Benefit Plans that are currently
sponsored, maintained or contributed to solely by a Transferred Company (the "
_Company Plans_ ") are set forth on  _Seller Schedule 4.10(a)(ii)_. None of
the Seller Benefit Plans other than the Company Plans will be sponsored or
maintained by a Transferred Company as of immediately prior to the Closing
Date. With respect to each Seller Benefit Plan, Seller has made available to
Buyer true and complete copies of all plan documents, summary plan
descriptions, and any other documentation that is material to Buyers
obligations under _Section 6.6_ or the Employee Matters Agreement.

 

(b) Each Seller Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in compliance
with its terms and with applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, except
for any non-compliance that, individually and in the aggregate, would not
result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect. None of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Seller Benefit
Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the
date of this Agreement (in the case of a Tax or penalty imposed by Section
4975 of the Code), would reasonably be expected to subject the Transferred
Companies or any Seller Benefit Plan to a Tax or penalty imposed by Section
502(i) of ERISA or by Section 4975 of the Code, either individually or in the
aggregate, in an amount which could be material. Each Seller Benefit Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, and the trust (if
any) forming a part thereof, has received a favorable determination letter
from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ "), each trust maintained
under any Seller Benefit Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code has received recognition of exemption from the IRS, and,
to the Knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred and no condition exists that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualified or exempt
status.

(c) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is reasonably expected to
be incurred by the Transferred Companies or any ERISA Affiliate. None of the
Transferred Companies or any ERISA Affiliate have failed to make any
contribution when due to any Seller Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA. As used in this Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " means,
with respect to a Transferred Company, any Person or any trade or business,
whether or not incorporated, that, together with such Transferred Company,
would be deemed a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of
ERISA prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(d) No Seller Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA. None of the Transferred Companies or any ERISA Affiliate has
made or suffered or will as of the Closing Date (including as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) have made or
suffered a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" as such terms are
respectively defined in Section 4203 and 4205 of ERISA, the liability for
which has not been satisfied in full.

 



38 (e) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any material
Seller Benefit Plan have been timely made when due and any other current
obligations with respect thereto are appropriately reflected on the Newco
Financial Statements and, when delivered, the Financial Statements.

 

(f) None of the Transferred Companies has obligations for retiree welfare
benefits other than ( _i_ ) coverage mandated by applicable Law or ( _ii_ )
Transferred Company contributions toward such mandated coverage that continues
during a severance period that does not exceed 18 months.

 

(g) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened written
claims against Seller or its Affiliates under workers compensation law or
under the Seller Benefit Plans that ( _i_ ) could transfer to Buyer (in whole
or in part) in connection with an assumption of obligations required by
_Section 6.6_ or the Employee Matters Agreement, ( _ii_ ) are not accrued
under the applicable Seller Benefit Plan or reflected on the Newco Financial
Statements and ( _iii_ ) if adversely determined, would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability to
Buyer.

(h) Except as contemplated by this Agreement or the Employee Matters
Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents will not (either alone or together with
any other event) ( _i_ ) entitle any Business Employee to severance, change of
control or other similar pay or benefits under any Seller Benefit Plan, or (
_ii_ ) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits to
any Business Employee or beneficiary of any Business Employee under any
Seller Benefit Plan, or increase the amount payable or trigger any other
material obligation with respect to any Business Employee or beneficiary of
any Business Employee.

 

(i) _Seller Schedule 4.10(i)_ sets forth a list (as of the date set forth
therein) of the individuals whose primary duties immediately prior to the
date hereof have been (or whose primary duties immediately prior to their last
date of active employment prior to commencing maternity or paternity leave,
educational leave, short-term disability, military leave with
veterans reemployment rights under federal law, leave under the Family
Medical Leave Act of 1993, or any other approved leave of absence, or in the
case of individuals who were union represented employees who have been laid
off and have a right to recall that has not expired, were) in respect of the
Transferred Business or the Transferred Assets. Such _Seller Schedule
4.10(i)_ separately identifies each Retained Employee and identifies as to

identification number and job title. In addition, _Seller Schedule 4.10(i)_
identifies an estimate of the call center employees and other classifications
of employees who do not individually devote a majority of their time to, but
who currently support the Transferred Business and Transferred Assets, and who
will be allocated to the Transferred Business (the " _Allocated Support
Employees_ "). Seller will provide a list of the names, identification
numbers and job titles of such Allocated Support Employees not later than 90
days prior to the Closing Date, and such list shall be deemed to amend _Seller
Schedule 4.10(i)_. The individuals set forth on _Seller Schedule 4.10(i)_ ,
as the same may be amended in accordance herewith, shall be referred to as the
" _Listed Employees_ ". Within both twenty-five (25) and ten (10) Business
Days before the date that Seller reasonably anticipates 

 



39  will be the Closing, Seller shall further revise _Seller Schedule 4.10(i)_
in accordance with the terms of Section 4.1(a) of the Employee Matters
Agreement, with any final updates to such information to be provided to Buyer
no later than ten (10) Business Days after the Closing in accordance with the

social security and unemployment Taxes.

(c) Neither Seller nor its Subsidiaries have engaged in any reductions in
force or plant closings affecting Business Employees which triggered any
notice obligation under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
as of the one-year period preceding the date hereof that remain unsatisfied

(d) Except for such matters which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Liability to Buyer of more
than five million dollars ($5,000,000), there is no pending, or to the
Knowledge of Seller, threatened strike, lockout, walkout, other work
stoppage, or any adverse labor action such as picketing or boycott by any

required to purchase or sell, as applicable, any equity interests in
or assets of any Person, in the case of this clause (v), having a purchase
price for acquisition of assets in excess of $5 million, ( _vi_ ) is a
Material Transferred Lease or ( _vii_ ) is a material partnership or joint
venture agreement or similar Contract (any of the foregoing, together with
any Contract of a type described above that is entered into after the date of
this Agreement and prior to Closing, other than any portion of any Master
Agreement that is not a Transferred Asset, a " _Material Contract_ ").

(b) Seller has made available to Buyer complete and accurate copies of
each Material Contract as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Each
Material Contract is valid and binding on Seller or its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, each other party thereto, and is
in full force and effect, except for failures to be valid and binding or to
be in full force and effect as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to the Transferred Business. There is no
default under any such Material Contract by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, or, to the Knowledge of Seller, any other party thereto, and no
event has occurred that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
both, would constitute a default thereunder by Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, or, to the Knowledge of Seller, any other party thereto, in each
case except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Transferred Business.

 



44 4.16 _Absence of Changes_. Since December 31, 2013 and through the date of
this Agreement, ( _a_ ) Seller and its Subsidiaries have conducted the
Transferred Business only in the Ordinary Course, and have not taken any
actions which, if taken after the date hereof, would require Buyers consent
pursuant to  _Section 6.2(a)(i)_ (with respect to such actions taken after
September 30, 2014 and in all cases disregarding the proviso in _Section
6.2(a)(i)_), _Section 6.2(a)(v)_, _Section 6.2(a)(vi)_ and  _Section
6.2(a)(x)_ and ( _b_ ) the Transferred Business has not experienced any event
or condition, and no condition, change, event, occurrence or development has
occurred, that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

4.17 _Assets_.

 

(a) After giving effect to the Pre-Closing Reorganization, and subject to the
receipt of all applicable approvals and consents, including

(b) Subject to the immediately following sentence, the assets of the
Transferred Companies as of the Closing Date (assuming the consummation
of the Pre-Closing Reorganization), together with the assets, licenses and
services to be made available pursuant to the Ancillary Documents, will be
sufficient, and constitute all assets of Seller and its Subsidiaries that are
necessary, to permit Buyer and the Transferred Companies to operate the
Transferred Business substantially in the same manner as the operation of the
Transferred Business as of the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
understood and agreed that:

listed or described in _Seller Schedule 4.17(b)(i)_ , which are necessary for
the conduct of the Transferred Business;

(ii) the Transferred Companies are not being assigned the Retained Contracts

necessary for the conduct of the Transferred Business;

(iii) certain of the administrative and regional headquarters management
employees currently operating or advising the Transferred Business may not be
transferred to the Transferred Companies and the immediately preceding
sentence assumes that Buyer or the Transferred Companies after Closing will
provide such equivalent personnel as may be appropriate for the benefit of the
Transferred Business;

 

(iv) certain Intellectual Property that is not owned by or licensed to the
Transferred Companies or included in the Transferred Assets is needed to

Seller will not be obligated to procure or grant rights in or licenses to such
Intellectual Property on behalf of the Transferred Companies or
the Transferred Business;

 



45 (v) certain Seller Owned Software is needed to operate the Transferred
Business. Except for any such Seller Owned Software to be licensed to Buyer
pursuant to an Ancillary Document or a software license agreement agreed upon

obligated to license any other Seller Owned Software or to procure rights in
or licenses to any similar third party software after Closing;

relationships (including Contracts and terms and conditions with respect to
such relationships) and ( _ii_ ) those assets identified as exclusions in
clauses ( _v_ ), ( _vi_ ) and ( _x_ ) of the definition of Excluded Assets,
and Buyer or the Transferred Companies will need to procure all other assets
needed to undertake such activities;

(viii) the provisions of this _Section 4.17_ assume the receipt of all
necessary authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers required by Law, by
Governmental Entities or other third Persons pursuant to their Contract rights
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents; and

(ix) this _Section 4.17_ does not constitute a representation or warranty
regarding infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any
Intellectual Property of any Person by the conduct of the Transferred
Business, which is the subject of the representation and warranty set forth in
_Section 4.14(a)_.

 

4.18 _Communications Licenses_. Seller and its Subsidiaries are the authorized
legal holders or otherwise have rights to the Communications Licenses, which
licenses constitute all of the material licenses, from the FCC or the State
Commissions that are required for and/or used in the operation of the
Transferred Business as presently operated. All the Communications Licenses
were duly obtained and are valid and in full force and effect, unimpaired by
any condition, except those conditions that may be contained within the terms

particular class of Communications Licenses generally. Seller and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules, regulations and
policies of the FCC and all applicable State Commissions in respect of the
operation of the

 



46  Transferred Business. There is not pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened, any action by or before the FCC or any State Commissions in which
the requested remedy is the revocation, suspension, cancellation, rescission
or modification of any of the Communications Licenses. _Seller Schedule 4.18_
contains a complete and correct list of Sellers Communications Licenses.

accurate copies of each of the Material Transferred Leases, as in effect as of

Transferred Leased Real Property have not suffered any material damage by
fire or other casualty which has not heretofore been repaired and restored to
its condition prior to such damage in all material respects, except for damage
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
be material to the Transferred Business.

 



47 4.21 _Finders  Fees_. There is no investment banker, broker, finder or
other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on
behalf of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that might be entitled to any fee
or commission from any of the Transferred Companies in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.

Except as set forth in the applicable section or subsection of the disclosure

each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of its assets or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for failures to be

Buyers or its Subsidiaries ability to perform their respective obligations
under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

  



48 5.2 _Corporate Authorization_. Buyer has full corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents, to

Ancillary Documents to which it is a party, and the consummation by Buyer of
the transactions contemplated hereunder and thereunder, except for those
consents, approvals, waivers, authorizations, reports, notices or filings the

or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or
delay Buyers or its Subsidiaries ability to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

(b) Assuming the receipt of all consents, approvals, waivers and
authorizations and the making of all notices and filings listed in _Section

Business or obtain any required Governmental Authorization, or materially
delay the grant of any consent set forth on _Buyer Schedule 5.3_. As of
the date of this Agreement, no Complaint has been filed with any Governmental

benefit to which Buyer is entitled under, any Contract or result in the
creation of any Encumbrance upon any of Buyers or its Subsidiaries assets

their respective obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

5.5 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents,
assuming due execution and delivery by Seller and the other parties thereto,
constitutes, or in the case of the Ancillary Documents will upon execution
thereof constitute, a valid and legally binding obligation of Buyer and each

review hearing or proceeding pending, or to the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened
against Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries at law or in equity relating to the
businesses of Buyer or its Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.

 



50 5.8 _Financial Capability_. At the Closing, assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_, Buyer will have sufficient funds to
effect the Closing and all other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents and to conduct its businesses and operations
following the Closing. Buyer has provided to Seller, on or prior to the date
of this Agreement, a true, complete and correct copy of the executed financing
commitment letter among Buyer, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., including any exhibits,
annexes, schedules or amendments thereto (collectively, the " _Commitment
Letter_ "), pursuant to which the lender party thereto has committed to
provide, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, debt financing
in the amounts set forth therein (the " _Committed Financing_ "). As of the
date of this Agreement, ( _i_ ) the Commitment Letter is ( _A_ ) a legal,
valid and binding obligation of Buyer and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, each of
the other parties thereto, ( _B_ ) enforceable in accordance with its terms
against Buyer and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, each of the other parties
thereto, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights
and general equity principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in
a proceeding at law or in equity) and ( _C_ ) in full force and effect, ( _ii_
) the Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified except as
permitted pursuant to _Section 6.15_, ( _iii_ ) none of the obligations and
commitments contained in the Commitment Letter has been withdrawn, terminated
or rescinded in any respect, ( _iv_ ) no event has occurred which (with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both) would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Buyer or, to the Knowledge of Buyer, any other parties
thereto under the Commitment Letter, and ( _v_ ) Buyer does not have any
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Committed Financing will
not be satisfied or that the Committed Financing will not be available to
Buyer at the Closing Date. Buyer has fully paid or caused to be paid any and
all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the Commitment Letter
that are payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement. The Commitment
Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the
lenders thereunder to fund the Committed Financing. Except for fee letters
relating to fees with respect to the Committed Financing (a complete copy of
which has been provided to Seller (the " _Fee Letter_ "), with only the fee
amounts, time periods, covenants that apply on and after the Closing Date,
pricing caps, specific flex terms that do not relate to conditionality and
other economic terms set forth therein (none of which would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the availability or aggregate principal amount of
the Committed Financing) redacted, _provided_ that Seller may only share such
Fee Letter with those Persons set forth on _Buyer Schedule 5.8_ ), as of the
date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other agreements,
arrangements or contracts (including fee letters) to which Buyer or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party that would affect the availability of the
Committed Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment
Letter. Without limiting _Section 7.2_, in no event shall the receipt or
availability of any funds or financing by or to Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the
obligations of Buyer hereunder.

 

5.9 _Solvency_. As of the Closing, after giving effect to any indebtedness
being incurred on such date in connection herewith, and assuming satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_, _Section 7.2(c)_ and
_Section 7.2(d)_, and assuming that the Transferred Business is not Insolvent
(as defined below) as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing,
neither Buyer nor the Transferred Companies will ( _i_ ) be insolvent (either
because its

 



51  financial condition is such that the sum of its debts (including a
reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities) is greater
than the fair value of its assets, or because the present fair salable value
of its assets will be less than the amount required to pay its probable
liability on its debts as they become absolute and matured), ( _ii_ ) have
unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its business or ( _iii_ )
have incurred or plan to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they become
absolute and matured (clauses (i)-(iii), " _Insolvent_ ").

 

5.10 _Regulatory Compliance_. Buyer and its Subsidiaries are the authorized
legal holders or otherwise have rights to all material permits, licenses,
franchises, waivers, orders, approvals, concessions, registrations and other
authorizations issued or granted by the FCC, the State Commissions and the
Video Franchisors that are required for and/or used in the operation
of Buyers business in the States (the " _Buyer Licenses_ "). The Buyer
Licenses were duly obtained and are valid and in full force and effect,
unimpaired by any condition, except those conditions that may be contained
within the terms of the Buyer Licenses or those conditions applicable to the
particular class of licenses generally. Buyer and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC, the State
Commissions and the Video Franchisors in respect of the operation of Buyers
business in the States, except to the extent that such non-compliance or
violation would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, delay or adversely affect Buyers ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There is not pending or, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, threatened, any action by or before the FCC, the State
Commissions or Video Franchisors that would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, delay or adversely affect Buyers ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.11 _Inspections_. Buyer is an informed and sophisticated purchaser that is,
and has engaged expert advisers that are, experienced in the evaluation and
purchase of property and assets such as the Transferred Companies and the
Transferred Assets as contemplated hereunder. Buyer has undertaken an
independent investigation of the business and operations of the Transferred
Business and has been provided with and evaluated such documents and
information made available by Seller as Buyer has determined are sufficient to
make an informed decision with respect to the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

_ARTICLE VI_

 

 _COVENANTS_

6.1  _Access and Information_.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, subject to any
applicable Laws, Seller shall afford Buyer and its representatives reasonable
access, during regular business hours and upon reasonable advance written
notice, to the Assigned Contracts, the Transferred Books and Records and the
officers of the Transferred Business, as Buyer shall from time to time
reasonably request in writing and otherwise as mutually agreed (including
pursuant to the Cutover Plan Support Agreement). Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to afford Buyer and its representatives reasonable
access, during regular business hours and upon

 



52  reasonable advance written notice, to ( _i_ ) accountants work papers
relating to the Transferred Books and Records and access to auditors of Seller
or any of its Affiliates and ( _ii_ ) properties of the Transferred Business
to the extent that circumstances arise that could reasonably be expected to
result in a material environmental Liability, _provided_ that Buyer or its
representatives, during such access, shall not conduct any invasive
procedures, including sampling of soil, groundwater, surface water or other
media; _it being understood_ and agreed that in no event shall Buyer have
access to ( _i_ ) any information that ( _x_ ) Sellers counsel advises
(after consultation in good faith with Buyers counsel) that sharing such
information would create any potential Liability under applicable Laws,
including U.S. Antitrust Laws, ( _y_ ) in the reasonable judgment of Seller
would violate any obligation of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to disclosure of information or confidentiality or eliminate or reduce the
benefit of any legal privilege of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (if, with
respect to confidentiality, Seller has made commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain a waiver regarding the possible disclosure from the third party to whom
it owes an obligation of confidentiality), _provided_   _that_ Seller shall
in good faith use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
information in a manner and form that would not reasonably be expected to
violate any such obligation with respect to disclosure of information
or confidentiality or eliminate or reduce the benefit of any such legal
privilege, or ( _z_ ) that constitutes Customer Proprietary Network
Information (other than as permitted by the rules and regulations of the FCC);
_provided_   _further_ that in the case of competitively sensitive
information, Seller and Buyer shall agree upon mutually acceptable "clean
team" procedures with respect to such information and _it being further
understood that_ Buyer shall reimburse Seller promptly for reasonable out of
pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in
complying with any such request by or on behalf of Buyer. All information
received by Buyer or its representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.1_
shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) Following the Closing, upon the request of the other party, Buyer and
Seller shall, to the extent permitted by Law, make available to the requesting
party and its representatives copies of all financial, Tax and other
information pertaining to the Transferred Business or the operation
or ownership of the Transferred Business and its assets and liabilities,
Transferred Assets, Assumed Liabilities and the Business Employees reasonably
requested in connection with ( _i_ ) any audit or other investigation by any
Taxing authority or any required returns, responses to inquiries, reports or
submissions to Governmental Entities (including reports filed with the SEC,
any consolidated financial or statutory reporting obligations and any Tax
Returns or replies to the Tax inquiries of Seller or its Subsidiaries) with
respect to the Transferred Business, the Transferred Companies, the
Transferred Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Excluded Liabilities
related to periods prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
shall have no obligation to provide copies of any Consolidated Tax Return, or
( _ii_ ) any matters relating to insurance coverage, third-party litigation,
claims, proceedings and investigations pertaining to the
Transferred Companies, the Transferred Assets, the Transferred Business, or
the Assumed Liabilities, as applicable, in each case with respect to periods
prior to the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer
shall comply with its obligations under _Section 6.5(i)_.

 



53 (c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, Seller
will transfer, or cause to be transferred, to the Transferred Companies the
organizational documents related to the Transferred Companies and materials in
any data room prepared by Seller or its Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the Closing, and until the
expiration of any applicable retention periods described in Sellers data
retention policy, as amended from time to time, Buyer or its Subsidiaries may
request a copy of any other Transferred Books and Records not previously
provided to Buyer. Upon receipt of such request, Seller or its Subsidiaries

56 6.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Governmental and Other Consents_.

 

(a) Each of Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to consummate as promptly as practicable
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including fulfilling the
conditions precedent to the other partys obligations hereunder, and securing
as promptly as practicable all Governmental Authorizations required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _it being
understood that_ nothing in this Agreement shall require, or be construed to
require, ( _i_ ) Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to ( _A_ ) subject to 
_Section 6.17(c)_, make any payment or incur any cost in connection with
fulfilling such conditions precedent, other than ( _x_ ) legal and accounting
fees and disbursements and regulatory filing fees and costs and ( _y_ )
payments or costs related to the Transferred Business that result in a dollar-
for-dollar payment to Seller as a Required Payment Amount, or ( _B_ ) take or
refrain from taking any action, agree to any restriction or condition or
enter into any agreement with respect to any of their assets or operations
other than the Transferred Business (a " _Seller Adverse Condition_ ") or (
_C_ ) request ( _x_ ) any consent from any third party which is party to a
Non-Scheduled Contract or ( _y_ ) subject to _Section 6.17(a)_, any consent
from any third party if such consent is not material to the Transferred
Business taken as a whole and Seller reasonably believes that such request
would materially adversely affect Sellers relationship with such third party
with respect to any of Sellers businesses other than the Transferred Business
or ( _ii_ ) with respect to the obligation to use reasonable best efforts to
secure Governmental Consents, Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to take or
refrain from taking any action that would reasonably be expected to have a
Buyer Adverse Condition. " _Buyer Adverse Condition_ " means any
action, restriction, condition or requirement which would, individually or in
the aggregate and when combined with the Required Payment Amount, reasonably
be expected to be materially adverse to Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including
the Transferred Companies) taken as a whole (with materiality being measured
for such purposes in relation to the financial condition, properties, assets,
liabilities, business and results of operations of the Transferred Business,
taken as a whole ( _i.e._ , a business the size of the Transferred Business),
rather than that of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) disregarding
for this purpose any condition or requirement ( _i_ ) that is consistent with,
or mandates the continuation of, the manner in which Buyer operates its and
its Subsidiaries existing business as of the date of this Agreement and/or
the manner in which Seller operates the Transferred Business as of the date of
this Agreement (including with respect to each of Buyers and its
Subsidiaries existing business and the Transferred Business, capital
expenditure conditions or requirements in an annualized amount consistent with
the capital expenditures spent in such business in the twelve (12) months
prior to the Closing) or ( _ii_ ) that is offered by Buyer in its discretion
in an application for an order approving the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or in any related filing or testimony. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer and Seller will make all filings and
submissions required by the U.S. Antitrust Laws, the FCC, any State Commission
and any Video Franchisor within forty-five (45) Business Days after the date
of this Agreement and promptly file any additional information requested as
soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such request therefor (
_provided_ _that_ any failure to make such filings within forty-five (45)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement shall not constitute a breach
of this Agreement so long as such filings are made as promptly as reasonably
practicable thereafter). To the extent that, as an accommodation to Buyer and
with Buyers prior written consent, Seller or any of its Subsidiaries incurs
costs that Buyer otherwise would have to incur in order to secure any
Governmental Authorization, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for any such
costs that are invoiced by Seller to Buyer.

 



57 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including  _Section 6.3(a)_), without limiting the generality of the
undertakings pursuant to this _Section 6.3_, each of Seller and Buyer agree
to take or cause to be taken the following actions: ( _i_ ) the prompt
provision to each and every federal, state, or local Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition Laws
or state or federal telecommunication Laws (including multi-channel video and
including any state, local municipal or county franchise authorities with
respect to video franchises) of non-privileged information and documents
requested by any such Governmental Entity or that are necessary, proper or
advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents; ( _ii_ ) the prompt use of its
reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of any permanent, preliminary or
temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination
or judgment that would reasonably be likely to delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, including the defense through
litigation on the merits of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other
proceeding by any Person, including any Governmental Entity, seeking to delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such
transactions; and ( _iii_ ) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to
take, in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or issued, or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or
inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents by the Termination Date, any and
all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or in the case
of Buyer, the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii) of this
paragraph) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so as to permit such
consummation prior to the Termination Date.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including  _Section 6.3(a)_), Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each
other and shall furnish to each other all information necessary or desirable
in connection with making any filing under the HSR Act and for any application
or other filing to be made pursuant to any competition or state, local or
federal telecommunications or franchising Law, or in connection with resolving
any investigation or other inquiry by any Governmental Entity or any consumer
advocate which is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a party to a
proceeding before a Governmental Entity (or any third-party consultant or
advisor to any of the foregoing) under any competition or state, local or
federal telecommunications or franchising Laws with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.
Each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly inform the other in writing of any
communication with, and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement
with, any Governmental Entity or any consumer advocate or third-party
consultant or advisor to any of the foregoing regarding any such filings or
any such transaction. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall participate in any
substantive meeting (in person or by telephone) with any Governmental Entity
or any consumer advocate or third-party consultant or advisor to any of the
foregoing in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry
without giving the other party prior written notice of, and the
opportunity to participate in, the meeting to the extent reasonably
practicable. To the extent not prohibited by Law and reasonably practicable,
the

 



58  parties will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party in connection
with all meetings, actions and proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or
other competition or state, local or federal telecommunications or franchising
Laws (including, with respect to making a particular filing, by providing
copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and their advisors prior
to making such filing and, if requested, giving due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith).

(d) To the extent necessary to comply with state laws and regulations and the
rules, regulations, written policies, instructions and orders of the FCC,
including those prohibiting "slamming" as set forth in 47 C.F.R. Section
64.1120, at least 60 days prior to the estimated Closing Date (as reasonably
estimated by the parties) ( _i_ ) Buyer shall, at its own expense, prepare
and deliver to Seller a draft notice providing the information required by 47
C.F.R. Section 64.1120(e) addressed to the telecommunications customers of the
Transferred Companies, after giving effect to the Pre-Closing Reorganization,
it being understood that Seller shall have the opportunity to review and
comment on the contents of such notice and Buyer shall give reasonable
consideration to any comment proposed by Seller and ( _ii_ ) Seller shall, at
Buyers cost and expense (which shall be a reimbursement of Sellers
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses), cause such notice
to be delivered to such customers at least 30 days before the estimated
Closing Date (as reasonably estimated by the parties) by a direct mailing or
in accordance with such method of notice and notification period that the FCC
or State Commissions may order or require. Seller will be responsible for
preparing, distributing, and filing (at Buyers expense) any notices relating
to "discontinuance, reduction, or impairment" of service to the customers of
the Transferred Companies after giving effect to the Pre-Closing
Reorganization required by 47 C.F.R. Sections 63.19 and 63.71.

(e) Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly,
acquire or agree to acquire (whether by merger, consolidation, stock or asset
purchase, tender or exchange offer, recapitalization, reorganization or any
other form of transaction) any other Person if and to the extent that such
transaction would reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the
ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including as a result of the failure of Buyer to obtain the Debt Financing or
have sufficient liquidity to fund its obligations in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

6.4 _Control of Business Pending the Closing_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, any right to control or

_v_ ) any withholding Taxes imposed on the payment of the Purchase Price as a

in respect thereof on the Final Closing Statement as finally determined, but
only to the extent applicable.

 

(b) _Buyer Liability for Taxes_. Buyer hereby agrees that from and after the
Closing it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified

pursuant to _Section 6.5(a)_; ( _B_ ) Buyer shall consider the

Date, except to the extent required by applicable Law.

 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. Seller and Buyer shall each bear one half of any

assessments or other proceedings in respect of Taxes (" _Tax Proceedings_ ")
and may make any decisions in connection with any Tax Proceeding relating to a

otherwise relates to Taxes for which Seller may be responsible under _Section
6.5(a)_; provided that ( _A_ ) to the extent that any Tax Proceeding
controlled by Seller relates to ( _1_ ) Taxes arising as a result of any

62  affect the Tax liability of the Buyer Indemnified Parties in a Post-Closing
Tax Period without the consent of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that ( _1_ ) nothing contained in this _Section
6.5(f)(ii)(B)_ shall prohibit Seller from settling, compromising or disposing

the extent Seller agrees in writing to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for any Losses arising out of, with respect to or by reason of such
settlement, compromise or disposition and ( _2_ ) for the avoidance of doubt,
this _Section 6.5(f)(ii)(B)_ shall in no event apply to a Tax Proceeding

proceedings and may make any decisions in connection with all Tax Proceedings
not controlled by Seller pursuant to _Section 6.5(f)(ii)_.

Tax paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates, or ( _y_ ) is the subject of
indemnification by Seller hereunder, Buyer shall promptly transfer, or cause
to be transferred, to Seller the entire amount of the refund or overpayment
(including interest or other additions thereto) received or utilized by Buyer
or its Affiliates, net of any Taxes or other reasonable costs incurred by

agrees to notify Seller promptly of both the discovery of a right to claim any
such refund or overpayment and the receipt of any such refund or utilization
of any such overpayment. Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
to claim any such refund or to utilize any such overpayment as soon as
possible and to furnish to Seller all information, records and assistance
necessary to verify the amount of the refund or overpayment, _provided_ , that

such overpayment described in this _Section 6.5(g)_.

(h)  _Assistance and Cooperation_. From and after the Closing, the parties
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in preparing any Tax Returns and for any audits of, or disputes with
Taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns involving the Transferred
Companies or Transferred Business and payments in respect thereof. Such
cooperation shall include, upon such other partys request, the provision of
records and information reasonably relevant to the Transferred Companies or
Transferred Business and any related Tax Returns or Tax Proceedings and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Seller shall have no obligation to provide Buyer copies of
any Consolidated Tax Returns.

 

(i) _Maintenance of Buyer s Books and Records_. Until the later of seven (7)
years following the Closing and expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (including periods of waiver) for any Tax Returns filed or
required to be filed covering the periods up to and including the Closing
Date, Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to,
retain all Books and Records related to the Transferred Business and
Transferred Companies and after the Closing Date will provide the other party
access to such Books and Records for

 



63  inspection and copying by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, or its respective
agents and representatives upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice.
After the expiration of such period, no Books and Records referred to in the
previous sentence shall be destroyed without first advising the other party in
writing and giving such party a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession
thereof, with any costs of transferring such Books and Records to be paid by
the party requesting such books and records; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Seller shall have no obligation to provide Buyer access to, or copies of, any
Consolidated Tax Returns.

 

(j) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. As of the Closing Date and, after the Closing
Date, none of the Transferred Companies shall be bound by or have any
liability under any Tax sharing agreements with respect to or involving the
Transferred Companies.

(k) _Survival_. The indemnification obligations pursuant to this _Section
6.5_, as well as the representations and warranties contained in _Sections
4.9(d)_, _4.9(h)_ , _4.9(i)_ , _4.9(j)_ and _4.9(l)_ , shall survive the
Closing until ninety (90) days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including any extensions thereof) relevant to each
particular item; provided that if a notice described under _Section
6.5(f)(i)_ is provided to the Indemnifying Party prior to any such expiration
date, any obligation to indemnify for any claim described in such notice shall
continue indefinitely until such claim is finally resolved.

 

(l) _Timing of Payments_. The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable
pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ promptly following receipt from an
Indemnified Party of a claim for a Loss that is the subject of indemnification
hereunder, unless and for so long as the Indemnifying Party in good faith
disputes the Loss in which event it shall so notify the Indemnified Party.
In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount of any Loss for which
it is liable hereunder no later than ten (10) Business Days following any
Final Determination of such Loss and the Indemnifying Partys liability
therefor. A " _Final Determination_ " shall exist when ( _i_ ) the parties to
the dispute have reached an agreement in writing, ( _ii_ ) a court
of competent jurisdiction shall have entered a final and non-appealable order
or judgment, or ( _iii_ ) an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a
final non-appealable determination with respect to disputes the parties have
agreed to submit thereto.

(m) _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except as otherwise
required by Law, all payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified
Party in respect of any claim pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ hereof shall be
treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 

(n) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

 

(i) Buyer and Seller agree to treat the indirect acquisition of each of GTE
Southwest Incorporated and Verizon California Inc. (each, a " _Section
338(h)(10) Company_ ") as a "qualified stock purchase" within the meaning of
Section 338(d)(3) of the Code and shall make a joint election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code, and comparable state and local Tax provisions, with
respect to the acquisition of each of the Section 338(h)(10) Companies and, to
the extent that an applicable States treatment of Newco and Verizon Florida
LLC does not conform to their U.S. federal income tax

 



64  treatment as entities disregarded as separate from GTE, with respect to each
of Newco and Verizon Florida LLC (the " _Section 338(h)(10) Elections_ "). At
the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall exchange properly completed and executed
originals of IRS Form 8023 and any similar state or local forms, and required
schedules thereto, containing information available at such time. If any
changes are required in the forms as a result of information which is first
available after such forms are prepared, Buyer and Seller will promptly agree
on such changes. After all required schedules to support the forms are
completed, Buyer and Seller shall file the forms, which filing shall be made
within the time period specified under applicable Law. Buyer and Seller and
their Affiliates shall make all required filings relating to the Section
338(h)(10) Elections in connection with their federal and applicable state
and local income Tax Returns, and shall cooperate fully with each other to
take all other actions necessary and appropriate otherwise to effect, perfect
and timely preserve the Section 338(h)(10) Elections.

 

(ii) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall ( _i_ )
draft a schedule allocating the deemed sales price of the assets of the
Section 338(h)(10) Companies resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections
among such assets (the " _Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Schedule_ ") and (
_ii_ ) deliver such Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Schedule to Seller for
Sellers review. The Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Schedule shall be prepared
in accordance with Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and the Treasury regulations
thereunder. If Seller believes that all or a portion of the Section
338(h)(10) Allocation Schedule is incorrect and Seller notifies Buyer in a
writing including a description of the objection and basis supporting Sellers
objections and any calculations or documentation that support the objection,
within 30 (thirty) days after having received the Section 338(h)(10)
Allocation Schedule, Buyer and Seller agree to consult and resolve in good
faith any such disputed item. In the event the parties are unable to resolve
any such dispute within 30 (thirty) days following notice to Buyer of Sellers
objection (in the form and within the time set forth herein), the Accountant
will be retained to resolve solely any issue in dispute as promptly as
possible and the determination of the Accountant shall be final with respect
to such disputed issues. Buyer and Seller shall then be bound by the Section
338(h)(10) Allocation Schedule as adjusted to reflect the determination,
if any, of the Accountant (the " _Section 338(h)(10) Final Allocation
Schedule_ "). The costs of the Accountant shall be borne equally by Buyer and
Seller. In the event that Final Net Working Capital is determined, or another
adjustment to the Purchase Price for tax reporting purposes is made under
this Agreement or the Employee Matters Agreement, after delivery of the
Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Schedule, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to
revise such schedule to take into account the portion of such Final Net
Working Capital or such other adjustment to the Purchase Price allocable to
the assets of the Section 338(h)(10) Companies. The Section 338(h)(10) Final
Allocation Schedule shall be used in preparing IRS Form 8883 and each of
Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer on the other hand, shall report the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and file all Tax Returns, in each
case, for federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes in accordance with
the Section 338(h)(10) Final Allocation Schedule.

(iii) Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any action, whether before or after
the Closing, that could reasonably be expected to cause the purchase and sale
of the membership interests of Newco contemplated by this Agreement not to be
treated as described in _Sections 3.7_ and this  _Section 6.5(n)_.

 



65 (o) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, solely for
purposes of this  _Section 6.5_ and _Section 4.9(l)_, and other than for
purposes of any references to "Effective Time", any references to the Closing
and Closing Date shall refer to the date on which the purchase and sale of all
the issued and outstanding limited liability company interest of Newco
actually occurs, and not the date on which the Closing and Closing Date are
deemed to occur under the penultimate sentence of _Section 3.3_.

 

(p) _Exclusivity_. All issues relating to indemnification for the Tax matters
addressed by _Section 6.5(a)_ and  _Section 6.5(b)_ shall be governed
exclusively by the provisions of this _Section 6.5_ and not by _Article VIII_
, including a breach of the representations and warranties contained in
_Section 4.9_ (Taxes). For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification
obligations under _Section 6.5(a)_ and _Section 6.5(b)_ shall not be subject
to the limits on indemnity as described in _Article VIII_.

 

6.6 _Employee Matters_. Seller and Buyer agree that throughout the Pre-Closing
Reorganization contemplated by this Agreement, the Listed Employees shall
maintain uninterrupted continuity of employment, compensation and benefits,
and, additionally for union-represented employees, uninterrupted continuity of
representation for purposes of collective bargaining and
uninterrupted continuity of coverage under their collective bargaining
agreements, in each case as contemplated by and provided in the Employee
Matters Agreement. Buyers obligations and responsibilities in respect of the
Business Employees shall be as set forth in the Employee Matters Agreement.

6.7 _Non-Solicitation of Employees_.

 

(a) Except as required by the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreements or
as otherwise mutually agreed by the parties, Seller agrees that it will not,
and it will cause its Subsidiaries not to, for a period from the Closing Date
until the date that is six (6) months after the Closing Date, ( _i_ ) solicit
or request any other Person to solicit any Business Employee to leave
employment of Buyer or to accept any other position or employment with Seller
Group, except for general solicitations of employment not targeted toward
employees of Buyer or ( _ii_ ) employ (directly or indirectly as a contractor)
any employee of the Buyer Group who has voluntarily separated from employment
with Buyer or any member of the Buyer Group within the immediately preceding
six (6) months, _provided_ that after the six (6) month anniversary of
the voluntary separation of any such employee, Seller or any member of the
Seller Group may employ or retain as a contractor such individual in its sole
discretion.

 

(b) Except for those employees who shall be retained and employed by the
Transferred Companies on and following the Closing Date or as otherwise
mutually agreed by the parties, Buyer agrees that for a period from the
Closing Date until the date that is six (6) months after the Closing Date, it
will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, ( _i_ ) solicit or
request any other Person to solicit ( _x_ ) any officer of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries who works in a business similar to the Transferred Business
or who otherwise negotiated or participated in the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or ( _y_ ) Sellers agents or contractors who are or

 



66  have been directly involved in supporting activities relating to the
effecting of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such as pre-
signing diligence or pre-closing readiness),  _provided_ , that Buyer shall
be permitted to hire the companies that employ such individuals but not the
individual agents or contractors who represented Seller or its Affiliates, to
leave such employment or to accept any other position or employment with
Buyer or its Affiliates except for general solicitations of employment not
targeted toward employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or ( _ii_ )
employ (directly or indirectly as a contractor) any employee of the
Seller Group who has voluntarily separated from employment with Seller or any
member of the Seller Group within the immediately preceding six (6) months,
_provided_ that after the six (6) month anniversary of the voluntary
separation of any such employee, Buyer or any member of the Buyer Group may
employ or retain as a contractor such individual in its sole discretion.

6.8  _Confidentiality_.

(a) Subject to _Section 6.9_, which shall govern Privileged Information, and
the terms of any Ancillary Document for the period commencing at the Closing
and expiring on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, treat as confidential and safeguard any and
all information, knowledge and data included as of the Closing in the
Transferred Business to the extent it is related to the Transferred Business
(other than Excluded Assets) other than information, knowledge or data that
becomes publicly available through no breach by Seller of this Agreement ("
_Buyer Confidential Information_ "). Thereafter, Seller shall not
intentionally disclose any such information, knowledge or data without Buyers
written consent. Nothing herein shall restrict Sellers ability to make any
disclosures that are required by applicable Law.

(b) For the period commencing at the Closing and expiring on the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, treat as confidential and safeguard any and all information,
knowledge and data relating to the businesses of Seller and its Subsidiaries,
other than to the extent it is related to the Transferred Business (other
than Excluded Assets) as of the Closing, that becomes known to Buyer as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents other than information, knowledge or data that ( _i_ ) becomes
known to Buyer from a third-party source not known by Buyer to be under an
obligation to Seller to maintain confidentiality; or ( _ii_ ) becomes publicly
available through no breach by Buyer of this Agreement (" _Seller
Confidential Information_ "). Thereafter, Buyer shall not intentionally
disclose any such Seller Confidential Information without Sellers written
consent. Nothing herein shall restrict Buyers ability to make
any disclosures that are required by applicable Law. For the period
commencing at the Closing and expiring on the third anniversary of the Closing
Date, Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall not use any Seller Confidential
Information for any purpose other than in connection with its rights and
obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents.

(c) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the confidentiality obligations set
forth herein shall not extend to information, knowledge and data ( _i_ ) the
disclosure of which is required by applicable Law, ( _ii_ ) that is publicly
available or becomes publicly available through no act or omission of the
party owing a duty of confidentiality, ( _iii_ ) that becomes available on a
non-confidential basis from a source other than the party owing a duty of
confidentiality so long as such source is not known by such party to be bound
by a confidentiality agreement with or other obligations of secrecy to the
other party or ( _iv_ ) that can reasonably be demonstrated to have been
independently developed by a party without reference to or use of the other
partys confidential information.

 



67 (d) In the event of a breach of the obligations hereunder by Buyer or Seller,
the other party, in addition to all other available remedies, will be
entitled to seek injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this _Section
6.8_ in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 

6.9 _Privileged Matters_.

 

(a) Each party hereto acknowledges that: ( _i_ ) each party and its Affiliates
has or may obtain Privileged Information; ( _ii_ ) there are and/or may be a
number of Litigation Matters affecting both of Buyer and Seller; ( _iii_ )
both Buyer and Seller have a common legal interest in Litigation Matters, in
the Privileged Information and in the preservation of the confidential status
of the Privileged Information, in each case relating to the Transferred
Business; and ( _iv_ ) both Buyer and Seller intend that the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and any
transfer of Privileged Information in connection therewith shall not operate
as a waiver of any potentially applicable privilege.

 

(b) Following the Closing, each of Buyer and Seller agrees, on behalf of
itself and each of its Subsidiaries, not to disclose or otherwise waive any
privilege attaching to any Privileged Information relating to the Transferred
Business without providing prompt written notice to and obtaining the prior
written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed and shall not be withheld, conditioned or
delayed if the other party certifies that such disclosure is to be made in
response to a likely threat of suspension or debarment or similar action;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be required to give any such
notice or obtain any such consent and may make such disclosure or waiver with
respect to Privileged Information if such Privileged Information relates
solely to the Transferred Business (unless such information relates to
matters for which Seller may have indemnification obligations under this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents). In the event of a disagreement
concerning the reasonableness of withholding such consent, no disclosure shall
be made prior to a resolution of such disagreement by a court of competent
jurisdiction, _provided_ that the limitations in this sentence shall not apply
in the case of disclosure required by Law and so certified as provided in the
first sentence of this paragraph.

(c) After the Closing, upon receipt of any subpoena or other compulsory
disclosure notice from a Governmental Entity or otherwise which requests
disclosure of Privileged Information relating to the Transferred Business, to
the extent not prohibited by Law, Seller or Buyer (in the case of information
relating to matters for which Seller may have indemnification obligations
under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, or in the case of Privileged
Information not solely related to the Transferred Business and in which Seller
may have an interest), as applicable, shall as promptly as practicable
provide to the other party (following the notice provisions set forth herein)
a copy of such notice, the intended response, and all materials or information
that might be disclosed and the proposed date of disclosure. In the event of a
disagreement as to the intended response or disclosure, unless and until the
disagreement is resolved as provided in paragraph (b) of this Section, the
disclosing party shall, at the other partys expense, cooperate to the extent
such other party seeks to limit such disclosure and take all reasonable steps
to resist or avoid such disclosure, except as otherwise required by a court
order requiring such disclosure.

 



68 (d) Nothing in this _Section 6.9_ shall limit a partys ability to assert
its rights under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents in the event of
any dispute between the parties.

6.10 _Production of Witnesses_. Subject to _Section 6.9_, after the Closing,
each of Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
use its respective reasonable best efforts to make available to Seller or
Buyer, as the case may be, upon reasonable prior written request, such
partys directors, managers or other persons acting in a similar capacity,
officers, employees and agents as witnesses to the extent that any such Person
may reasonably be required in connection with any Litigation Matters,
administrative or other proceedings in which the requesting party may from
time to time be involved and relating to the Transferred Business, as
applicable. The reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in the provision of such witnesses shall be paid by the
party requesting the availability of such persons.

6.11 _Release by Seller and Its Affiliates_. Seller, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, successors, and assigns (all such Persons, together with
Seller, the " _Seller Release Parties_ "), as of the Closing, hereby releases
and forever discharges Buyer, and its Affiliates, successors and assigns (all
such Persons (including the Transferred Companies), together with Buyer, the "
_Buyer Release Parties_ "), from any and all Liabilities which the Buyer
Release Parties may have or may have had, known or unknown, from the
beginning of the world until the Closing, arising out of or against the
Transferred Companies or the Transferred Assets or the Transferred Business;
_provided_ _that_ nothing herein constitutes a release from, waiver of, or
otherwise applies to the terms of this Agreement (including any matters for
which Buyer has indemnification obligations pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement) or any Ancillary Documents, or any Liability, Contract or
arrangement contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Document to be in
effect after the Closing, or any enforcement thereof; _provided_ _further_
_that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Ancillary
Document that constitutes an amendment to an existing agreement, the release
herein shall apply to the terms of such existing agreement and any enforcement
thereof for all periods prior to the Closing, unless otherwise contemplated by
such Ancillary Document. Seller, for itself and the Seller Release Parties,
hereby irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly,
asserting any claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be
commenced or voluntarily aiding, any proceeding of any kind against any Buyer
Release Party, based upon any matter purported to be released hereby. Seller,
for itself and the Seller Release Parties, shall refrain from bringing any
Action for contribution or indemnification from the Buyer Release Parties
(only with respect to the Transferred Companies or as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), or otherwise commencing,
instituting or causing to be commenced any Action against any Buyer Release
Party (only as it relates to the Transferred Companies or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), for or in respect of any of the Actions set
forth on _Buyer Schedule 6.11_.

 

6.12 _Release by Buyer and Its Affiliates_. Buyer, on behalf of itself and the
Buyer Release Parties, as of the Closing, hereby releases and forever
discharges all Seller Release Parties from any and all Liabilities which the
Seller Release Parties may have or may have had, known or unknown, from the
beginning of the world until the Closing, arising out of or against

 



69  the Transferred Companies, the Transferred Assets or the Transferred
Business (other than Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities); _provided_ that
nothing herein constitutes a release from, waiver of, or otherwise applies to
the terms of this Agreement (including any matters for which Seller has
indemnification obligations pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement) or
any Ancillary Documents or any Liability, Contract or
arrangement contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Document to be in
effect after the Closing, or any enforcement thereof; _provided_ _further_
that, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Ancillary Document that
constitutes an amendment to an existing agreement, the release herein shall
apply to the terms of such existing agreement and any enforcement thereof for
all periods prior to the Closing, unless otherwise contemplated by such
Ancillary Document. Buyer, for itself and the Buyer Release Parties, hereby
irrevocably covenants to refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any
claim or demand, or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced or
voluntarily aiding, any proceeding of any kind against any Seller Release
Party, based upon any matter purported to be released hereby.

6.13 _Customer Agreements_.

 

(a) With respect to Master Agreements, Seller, Buyer and their respective
Subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the
Closing or, if not obtained, will use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain within six (6) months following the Closing Date (other than for
Federal Government Contracts for which there will be no six (6) month limit on
the parties obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
Federal Government novation), from the counterparty to each Master Agreement,
any consent that is required to separate the portion of such Master Agreement
that provides for the delivery of ILEC Services or other goods or services
provided by the Transferred Business, it being understood that neither Seller
nor Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to grant
any consideration to any counterparty to such Master Agreement. Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate and work in good faith to separate the applicable
portion of any Master Agreement hereunder. The Contract constituting the
separated portion of any Master Agreement that provides for the delivery of
ILEC Services or other goods or services provided by the Transferred Business
as described in the preceding sentence shall constitute a " _Customer
Contract_ " and " _Assigned Contract_ " under this Agreement, it being
understood that in no event shall those portions of any Master Agreement
providing for the delivery of goods and services that do not constitute ILEC
Services or other goods or services provided by the Transferred Business be
considered a Customer Contract or any Assigned Contract.

(b) Buyer agrees that, to the extent Tariffs or agreements
implementing Tariffs contain rates and charges or other terms and conditions
based on volume of service, amount of purchase or spend, or similar volume
commitments by the customers which are party to agreements implementing such
Tariffs with customers served by Seller or its Affiliates under Master
Agreements and the agreements of customers who do not provide consents under
this Agreement (the " _Volume Commitments_ "), Buyer will, for the term of
each such Master Agreement, reduce such Volume Commitments pro-rata, without
a change in rates and charges or other terms and conditions under such Tariffs
or agreements, to reflect the fact that the customers who are party to such an
Agreement or such Affiliates may, after the Closing, take service from both
Affiliates of Seller and Buyer and not from Affiliates of Seller or Buyer
alone. The pro-rata reduction shall be equal to or exceed the amount of the
Volume Commitment

 



70  provided by Affiliates of Seller after the Closing. By way of example, and
not by limitation, if after the Closing, such customer or Affiliate purchased
75% of a Volume Commitment from Buyer and 25% of a Volume Commitment from
Affiliates of Seller, then Buyer would reduce the Volume Commitment by 25% in
affected Tariffs and agreements implementing such Tariffs. Buyer and Seller
shall work together to make all filings and take all other actions as may be
required by applicable Laws to make the pro-rata reductions of Volume
Commitments adopted or made by Buyer under this _Section 6.13(b)_ legally
effective no later than the Closing Date and each party shall bear its
own costs associated with making its required filings.

(c) Buyer and Seller agree to use commercially reasonable efforts after
Closing to finalize a United States Federal Government novation (per Federal
Acquisition Regulation, Subpart 42.12) to have the Federal Government
recognize the transfer, as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to the Transferred Companies (and/or Buyer) of any: ( _i_ )
Contracts between Seller and its Subsidiaries and U.S. Federal Government
agencies which are exclusively for the provision of ILEC Services or the
Transferred Business in the States if there remain continuing obligations or
rights under them or the Federal Government has not closed out the Contract(s)
or ( _ii_ ) portions of Master Agreements between Seller and its Subsidiaries
and the United States Federal Government agencies to the extent related to
the provision of ILEC Services or the Transferred Business in the States if
there remain continuing obligations or rights under them or the Federal
Government has not closed out the Contract(s).

 

6.14 _Insurance_. Following the Closing, to the extent that (i) any insurance
policies owned or controlled by any member of the Seller Group and provided
by a Person who is not an Affiliate of Seller (collectively, " _Seller
Insurance Policies_ ") cover any Assumed Liability or Loss of any of the
Transferred Companies resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating
to, occurrences prior to the Closing and (ii) the Seller Insurance Policies
permit claims to be made thereunder with respect to the Assumed Liabilities or
such Losses resulting from, arising out of, based on or relating to,
occurrences prior to the Closing (the " _Company Claims_ "), at Buyers cost
and expense (including any increased retrospective premiums, deductible and
other retention amounts and any other reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses related to such Company Claims), Seller shall, and shall cause the
other members of Seller Group to, cooperate with Buyer or its Subsidiaries in
submitting Company Claims (or pursuing claims previously made) on behalf of
Buyer or such Subsidiary, as applicable, under any Seller Insurance Policy;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer acknowledges and agrees that ( _A_ ) none
of Seller or any member of the Seller Group shall be responsible for any
Assumed Liabilities or Losses that are "self-insured" by Seller or any member
of Seller Group as of immediately prior to the Closing, that are within any
applicable deductible or retention amounts under any Seller Insurance Policy
or that are insured by any captive insurer, ( _B_ ) none of Seller or any
member of the Seller Group shall be liable to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) for any losses or
other amounts hereunder if any insurance company that has issued any Seller
Insurance Policy fails to pay such losses or amounts as a result of, or in
connection with, the filing or declaration of, or institution of proceeding
for, any type of bankruptcy (whether voluntary or involuntary), insolvency or
the commencement of any similar action or proceeding or otherwise, ( _C_ ) the
Seller Group may, at any time, without liability or obligation to Buyer or its
Subsidiaries, including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies,
amend, commute, terminate, buy-out, extinguish liability under or otherwise
modify any Seller Insurance Policy and ( _D_ ) following the Closing, the
Transferred Companies shall continue to be

 



71  responsible for payment of any assessments made by any Governmental Entity
associated with any Assumed Liabilities and none of Seller or any member of
the Seller Group shall be responsible for the payment or reimbursement of any
such assessments. Nothing in this _Section 6.14_ shall relieve Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies)
from any obligations with respect to the Assumed Liabilities or any other
Losses. Nothing in this _Section 6.14_ affects rights of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties to be indemnified under _Section 8.3_. This Agreement
shall not be construed to waive any right or remedy of any member of Seller
Group in respect of any Seller Insurance Policy.

6.15 _Financing_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts (unless, with respect to any action, another standard
for performance is expressly provided for herein) to obtain the Committed
Financing (taking into account any reductions thereof pursuant to _Section
6.15(b)(I)(A)_) on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter (taking into account the anticipated timing of the
Marketing Period Termination Date), and Buyer shall not permit any amendment
or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the
Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter (or following entry into definitive
documents relating to the Committed Financing), such definitive documents) if
such amendment, modification or waiver ( _A_ ) with respect to the Commitment
Letter or the Fee Letter or such definitive documents, as applicable, reduces
(or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate
amount of the Committed Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees
to be paid or original issue discount unless the Committed Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount or the Committed Financing is otherwise
made available to fund such fees or original issue discount) from that
contemplated in the Commitment Letter or such definitive documents (other than
any reductions permitted pursuant to _Section 6.15(b)(I)(A)_), or ( _B_ )
imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies
any of the conditions to the Committed Financing, in a manner that would, in
the case of this subclause (B), reasonably be expected to ( _x_ ) prevent or
materially delay the Closing or the availability of the Committed Financing on
the Closing Date or ( _y_ ) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce
its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letter in any material
respect ( _provided_ that, subject to compliance with the other provisions of
this _Section 6.15_, Buyer may amend the Commitment Letter or such
definitive documents to add additional lenders, arrangers and agents). Buyer
shall promptly deliver to Seller copies of any such amendment, modification or
replacement. For purposes of this _Section 6.15_ and _Section 5.8_ and
the definitions of, and references to, the Financing, any Committed Financing
Source, any Financing Source and the Marketing Period Termination Date,
references to " _Committed Financing_ " shall include the financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter as permitted by this _Section 6.15(a)_
to be amended, modified or replaced and references to " _Commitment Letter_ "
shall include such document as permitted by this _Section 6.15(a)_ to be
amended, modified or replaced.

(b) Buyer shall ( _I_ ) use its reasonable best efforts (taking into account
the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period Termination Date) to ( _A_ )
maintain in effect the Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof, _provided_ that, subject to clause (IV) of
this sentence and to the penultimate sentence of this _Section 6.15(b)_,
Buyer may, without Sellers consent, reduce the amount of the Committed
Financing

 



72  under the Commitment Letter to the extent that the remaining amount of the
Committed Financing under the Commitment Letter after such reduction, taken
together with the net cash proceeds of one or more offerings, placements,
sales and/or other issuances of debt and/or equity securities of or term loans
to Buyer that are placed into escrow for use solely in paying amounts payable
by Buyer at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement, is no less than
$10,540,000,000 less the Debt Obligations, ( _B_ ) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Committed Financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter (or on such other terms not materially less favorable to
Buyer (or its Subsidiaries), as determined in the reasonable judgment of Buyer
after consultation with Seller, than the terms and conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter and that do not materially impair the ability of Buyer to
fund its obligations at the Closing Date), ( _C_ ) satisfy all conditions to
funding in the Commitment Letter and such definitive agreements with respect
thereto that are within its control and to consummate the Committed Financing
at or prior to the Closing Date, as applicable, including using its reasonable
best efforts to cause the lenders and the other persons committing to fund the
Committed Financing on the Closing Date (the " _Committed Financing Sources_
"), ( _D_ ) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and any definitive
agreements with respect thereto and ( _E_ ) comply with its obligations under
the Commitment Letter, ( _II_ ) not use any net proceeds received and placed
in escrow as contemplated in this _Section 6.15(b)_ from any Financing other
than to fund amounts required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement
at Closing and fees and expenses related to the Financing and the
transactions contemplated hereby, ( _III_ ) maintain cash on hand or access to
other liquid sources of funding in an amount sufficient to make all payments
required to be made by Buyer related to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any Required Payment Amount (the amount of which, solely for this
purpose, shall be estimated in the good faith judgment of Buyer from time to
time, to the extent such amount is not finally determined) and ( _IV_ ) not
take any action that would cause the amount of the Committed Financing to be
reduced to the extent that the remaining amount of the Committed Financing
under the Commitment Letter after such reduction, taken together with the net
cash proceeds of one or more offerings, placements, sales and/or other
issuances of debt and/or equity securities of or term loans to Buyer, as
contemplated by the Commitment Letter and the related fee letter, that are
placed into escrow (which escrow complies with the penultimate sentence of
this _Section 6.15(b)_) for use solely in paying amounts payable by Buyer at
the Closing pursuant to this Agreement, is less than $10,540,000,000 less the
Debt Obligations. The conditions for the release of funds from any escrow
referred to in this _Section 6.15(b)_ shall include no new, additional or
modified conditions beyond those applicable to the Committed Financing to the
extent that such new, additional or modified conditions would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the Closing or the availability of the
escrowed funds on the Closing Date.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall give Seller
prompt notice ( _x_ ) of any breach or default by any party to the Commitment
Letter or definitive agreements relating to the Committed Financing of which
Buyer has Knowledge, ( _y_ ) of the receipt of any notice or other
communication, in each case from any Committed Financing Source with respect
to any actual or potential material breach, material default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements
relating to the Committed Financing of any provisions of the Commitment Letter
or definitive agreements relating to the Committed Financing and ( _z_ ) if
at any time for any reason Buyer believes that it will not be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Committed Financing on the terms and 

 



73  conditions, in the manner or from the Committed Financing Sources
contemplated by the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements relating to the
Committed Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date Seller
delivers to Buyer a written request, Buyer shall provide any information
reasonably requested by Seller relating to any circumstance referred to in
clause ( _x_ ), ( _y_ ) or ( _z_ ) of the immediately preceding sentence.
Upon the occurrence of any circumstance referred to in clause ( _x_ ), ( _y_ )
or ( _z_ ) of the second preceding sentence resulting in any portion of the
Committed Financing becoming unavailable, or if any portion of the Committed
Financing otherwise becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including
the flex provisions) contemplated in the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter, and
such portion is reasonably required to effect the Closing, Buyer shall use
its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof
alternative financing (" _Alternative Financing_ ") from alternative sources
in an amount at least equal to the Committed Financing or such unavailable
portion thereof, as the case may be (taking into account any reductions
thereof pursuant to _Section 6.15(b)(I)(A)_), with terms and conditions not
materially less favorable to Buyer (or its Subsidiaries), as determined
in the reasonable judgment of Buyer after consultation with Seller, than the
terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter
(including the flex provisions therein) and as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the occurrence of such event. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the reasonable best efforts obligation set forth in
this _Section 6.15_ be construed so as to require Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to ( _i_ ) agree to, or accept, economic terms that are materially
less favorable to Buyer, as determined in the reasonable judgment of Buyer
after consultation with Seller, than the economic terms contained in the
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter (assuming the application of the "market
flex" provisions) or ( _ii_ ) seek any equity investment or any offering,
placement, sale or other issuance of any equity securities (it being
understood and agreed that any Alternative Financing shall be permitted to be
in the form of any such equity financing). Buyer shall deliver to Seller true
and complete copies of all written agreements, arrangements or contracts
(including any side letters or (subject to customary redactions) fee
letters) pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed
to provide any Alternative Financing.

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement, and through the earliest of
the Closing, the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Article IX_ and the completion of the Committed Financing, Seller shall, and
Seller shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of its and their
representatives to, use its respective reasonable best efforts to provide all
cooperation that is necessary, customary or advisable and reasonably requested
by Buyer to assist Buyer in the arrangement of the Committed Financing and
any public or private offering, sale, placement or other issuance of debt
and/or equity securities undertaken in replacement of all or a portion of the
Committed Financing (the " _Securities Financing_ " and, together with the
Committed Financing, the " _Financing_ ") for the purposes of financing the
Purchase Price and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and all related
fees and expenses of Buyer (it being acknowledged and agreed by Buyer that
the receipt of such Financing is not a condition to the Closing), including (
_A_ ) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, road shows, rating
agency sessions and drafting sessions, and participating in reasonable and
customary due diligence, ( _B_ ) furnishing Buyer and the Committed Financing
Sources with the Required Information, ( _C_ ) assisting Buyer and the
Committed Financing Sources in the preparation of ( _1_ ) offering documents
for the Financing and ( _2_ ) materials for rating agency presentations, bank
confidential information memoranda, pro forma financial statements and similar
documents in 

 



74  connection with the Financing, ( _D_ ) reasonably cooperating with the
marketing efforts for any portion of the Financing, ( _E_ ) using its
reasonable efforts to cause its independent accountants to provide assistance
and cooperation in the Financing, including ( _1_ ) participating in a
reasonable number of drafting sessions and accounting due diligence sessions,
( _2_ ) providing any necessary customary consents to use or file with the
SEC their audit reports relating to the Transferred Business and ( _3_ )
providing any necessary customary "comfort letters," ( _F_ ) causing the
Transferred Companies to execute and deliver customary definitive financing
documents to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer and otherwise
facilitating the pledging of collateral reasonably necessary to secure the
Financing; _provided_ that the effectiveness of any definitive documentation
executed by the Transferred Companies or the pledging of collateral by the
Transferred Companies shall be subject to the occurrence of the Closing and (
_G_ ) furnishing Buyer and any Committed Financing Sources promptly, and in
any event at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, with all
documentation and other information required by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as
amended. Nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would
( _A_ ) unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the business or operations of
Seller or its Subsidiaries, ( _B_ ) require Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other cost or expense
that is not reimbursed by Buyer or otherwise incur any liability or give
any indemnities, in connection with the Financing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller shall be responsible for such fees, costs and expenses incurred by
Seller in connection with preparing and delivering any of the Financial
Statements provided for in _Sections 6.18(a)_ or _6.18_ (b), or ( _C_ )
require Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result in any violation or breach
of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or other comparable organizational
documents of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, any applicable Laws or any
material Contract. In addition, nothing herein shall require Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of its representatives to deliver legal opinions. In
furtherance of and without limitation to the second immediately preceding
sentence, nothing herein shall require Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to,
enter into any agreement (or require their respective boards of directors or
equivalent governing bodies to approve any such agreement) in connection with
the Financing. Except for the fees, costs and expenses incurred by Seller in
connection with preparing and delivering any of the Financial Statements
provided for in _Sections 6.18(a)_ or _6.18_ (b), Buyer shall promptly, upon
request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket third party costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
representatives in connection with the Financing and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller, its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
and any information used in connection therewith (other than arising from
fraud, intentional misrepresentation, misstatements or omissions on the part
of Seller or its Affiliates).

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its applicable
Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver each Ancillary Document, and Seller

of the Seller Group by any of the Transferred Companies, or provided to the
Transferred Companies by any member of the Seller Group and ( _ii_ ) all
Intellectual Property licenses granted by any member of the Seller Group to
any of the Transferred Companies, including any agreements or understandings
(written or oral) with respect thereto, will terminate as of the Closing.

6.17 _Assistance with Network Element Software; Seller Owned Software_.

(a) Prior to Closing, except to the extent Buyer instructs Seller otherwise
with respect to any Software license, the parties shall reasonably cooperate
to seek any consents required in connection with the assignment to Newco of
the Software licenses between Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Companies) and a third party for Network Element Software used in
the Transferred Business, _provided_ that, if any such licenses were obtained
pursuant to a master or enterprise license agreement that benefits both the
Transferred Business and one or more of Sellers other businesses, the
parties shall reasonably cooperate to seek consent to assign only the portions
of such licenses that are applicable to the Transferred Business
(collectively, the " _Network Element Software Licenses_ "). If consent for
assignment of any Network Element Software License cannot reasonably be
obtained, Seller shall not be responsible for providing an alternative
arrangement for the use of the applicable Network Elements or Network Element
Software (other than by bearing its portion of the NES Consideration as set
forth in _Section 6.17(c)_).

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for negotiating and obtaining its own
Contracts with third parties to replace any Network Element Software Licenses
in respect of which, following the commercially reasonable efforts of the
parties, consent for assignment cannot be obtained. Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to: ( _i_ ) identify all Network Element Software and
third party licensors of Network Element Software as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof and ( _ii_ ) provide ( _A_ ) a preliminary
schedule of such information to Buyer within two (2) months after the date
hereof and ( _B_ ) a substantially final schedule of such information to Buyer
within six (6) months after the date hereof. Buyer shall use such schedules
to ( _x_ ) obtain its own Contracts for such Network Element Software (to the
extent necessary in accordance with _Section 6.17(a)_), ( _y_ ) notify Seller
of any consents for which it will not require Sellers cooperation pursuant
to _Section 6.17(a)_ and ( _z_ ) obtain appropriate maintenance services with
respect to the Network Element Software.

 

(c) Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear fifty percent (50%) of any consent or
one-time license fees required to be paid to ( _i_ ) any third party vendor
in connection with the assignment of any Network Element Software Licenses
pursuant to _Section 6.17(a)_ and ( _ii_ ) any third party vendor in
connection with Buyers entry into any Contracts to replace any Network
Element Software Licenses pursuant to _Section 6.17(b)_ (collectively, the "
_NES Consideration_ ") until the aggregate of all such NES Consideration
equals $5,000,000 (five million dollars). Buyer shall bear one hundred
percent (100%) of the portion of the NES Consideration that exceeds $5,000,000
(five million dollars).

 



76 (d) From and after the date hereof until such date that is five (5) years
after the Closing Date, to the extent Buyer identifies any Seller Owned
Software installed on a Network Element that is necessary for the operation of
the Network Element, as operated as of the Closing, then Seller and Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith, or amend the Software License Agreement to
include, a perpetual, royalty-free license to such Seller Owned Software, on
an "as-is, where-is" basis, solely for use as necessary for the operation of
the Network Element in the conduct of the Transferred Business and solely on
the Network Elements on which such Seller Owned Software was installed as of
the Closing.

(e) From and after the date hereof until such date that is five (5) years
after the Closing Date, to the extent Buyer identifies any Seller Owned
Software (other than Seller Owned Software to which Buyer is entitled to a
license pursuant to  _Section 6.17(d)_) that is unique to Seller and
necessary for the delivery of services to customers of the Transferred
Business as conducted as of the Closing, then Seller and Buyer shall negotiate
in good faith, or amend the Software License Agreement to include, a
perpetual, royalty-free license to such Seller Owned Software, on an "as-is,
where-is" basis, solely for use as necessary for the conduct of the
Transferred Business and as such Seller Owned Software was used in the
Transferred Business as of the Closing.

(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that ( _i_ ) Seller Owned Software
shall not be unique to Seller or deemed to be unique to Seller, for purposes
of _Section 6.17(e)_, if it is reasonably practicable for Buyer to replace
such Seller Owned Software with third party Software that is generally or
commercially available and, if necessary, is customizable for use in the
Transferred Business, ( _ii_ ) neither _Section 6.17(d)_ nor _Section
6.17(e)_ shall apply to any modules, scripts, applications, components or sub-
categories of the SLA Licensed Software that are not expressly set forth, as
of the date hereof, in Schedule A to the Software License Agreement and (
_iii_ ) Seller shall have no responsibility to provide or license (as
applicable) to Buyer or any of its Affiliates any maintenance, support,
training, revisions, updates, upgrades, modifications, enhancements, new
versions, bug fixes, patches or any other assistance of any kind for any
Seller Owned Software licensed pursuant to  _Section 6.17(d)_ or _6.17_ (e),
unless expressly negotiated and agreed pursuant to a separate Contract between
the parties or any of their respective Affiliates.

 

(g) From the Closing Date until the date that is five (5) years after the
Closing Date, Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby
covenants not to sue or commence any other legal proceeding against the Buyer
or its Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) due to the presence,
on any Transferred Assets as of the Closing, of any Seller Owned Software to
which Buyer and its Affiliates have not been granted a license, _provided_
that, upon learning of any such Seller Owned Software, Buyer promptly either (
_i_ ) requests and obtains a license for such Seller Owned Software from
Seller pursuant to _Section 6.17(d)_ or _Section 6.17(e)_ or ( _ii_ )
deletes such Seller Owned Software from the applicable Transferred Assets, at
Buyers expense, and certifies to Seller in writing that such deletion has
been completed.

connection with its reporting obligations under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act.

(a) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document,
it is expressly agreed that none of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) is purchasing,
acquiring, licensing or otherwise obtaining under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document any right, title or interest (whether express or implied)
in, to or under ( _i_ ) the trademarks Verizon, "Verizon" Logo, "V" Logo, VZ,
FIOS, GTE, MCI, NYNEX and BELL ATLANTIC or any other Trademarks that are owned
or controlled by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
derivation, variation, translation or adaptation thereof, or any Trademarks
that are confusingly similar to, including or embodying any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Seller Trademarks_ "), or ( _ii_ ) any other
Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, prior to the Closing, the Transferred Companies) (the
foregoing, together with the Seller Trademarks, the " _Seller IP_ ").

 



79 (b) Buyer, for itself and its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the
Transferred Companies), acknowledges and agrees that, ( _i_ ) as between the
parties hereto, Seller or its Subsidiaries own or have the exclusive right to
use and display any and all of the Seller Trademarks and except as otherwise
expressly provided in this _Section 6.19_ or in any Ancillary Document,
neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the
Transferred Companies) shall, as of the Closing, have any rights in or to the
Seller Trademarks and ( _ii_ ) neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) shall contest the
use, ownership or validity of any rights of Seller or its Subsidiaries in or
to the Seller IP that exists as of the Closing.

(c) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or any Ancillary Document,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing,
the Transferred Companies) to, cease and discontinue as of the Closing any and
all uses of any and all Seller IP at the expense of Buyer or its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies). Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing, the Transferred Companies) shall have a limited right to utilize
existing stationery, business cards, signage, vehicles, advertising
materials, inventory, packaging, products, equipment, hard hats, tools, tool
boxes, kits (safety and others), displays, manuals, forms, service and
training literature, bulletins, sales literature, websites, email, computer
software, Transferred IT Systems, and other similar materials bearing the
Seller Trademarks (but excluding all credit and collection materials and
notices) (" _Seller Materials_ ") following the Closing in the administration
of the Transferred Business as conducted immediately prior to the Closing
Date until the existing supply of such items is depleted or until the date
that is one hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date (such one
hundred twenty (120) day period, the " _Phaseout Period_ "), whichever occurs
first; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and
its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies)
shall ( _i_ ) have a period of up to one hundred eighty (180) days following
the Closing Date to remove the Seller Trademarks from signs and vehicles to
the extent Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the
Transferred Companies) undertake commercially reasonable efforts immediately
to remove such Seller Trademarks from such signs and vehicles, and ( _ii_ )
use commercially reasonable efforts to remove the Seller Trademarks from
tools, equipment, manuals and, except as expressly set forth in  _Section
6.19(d)(ii)_, other written materials or other assets that are used solely for
internal purposes and are not visible by the public, on or prior to the date
that is two hundred seventy (270) days following the Closing Date,
or otherwise promptly after becoming aware of any Seller Trademarks on any of
the foregoing items. Subject to the foregoing sentence, on or prior to the
expiration of the Phaseout Period (or the timeframes set forth in  _Section
6.19(c)(i)-(ii)_, as applicable), Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) to,
destroy, or to remove, strike over, cover over or otherwise eliminate all
Seller Trademarks from, all Seller Materials in their possession and to send
a written statement to Seller confirming that Buyer has, and has caused its
Subsidiaries to have, exhausted or destroyed all such Seller Materials or
eliminated all Seller Trademarks therefrom. The foregoing permitted uses in
this _Section 6.19(c)_ are subject to ( _x_ ) compliance by Buyer and its
Subsidiaries with the reasonable quality control requirements and guidelines
in effect for the Seller Trademarks immediately prior to the Closing, and (
_y_ ) the

 



80  conduct of the Transferred Business at a standard and with skill that is at
least commensurate with the standard and skill at and with which the
Transferred Business was conducted immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer
and its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies)
agree that any use of the Seller Trademarks in the operation of the
Transferred Business after the Closing, as permitted by this  _Section
6.19_, shall be provided in accordance with all applicable Laws, and Buyer and
its Subsidiaries shall not use the Seller Trademarks in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to reflect adversely upon Sellers good name. Buyer
and its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Transferred
Companies), shall promptly cease use of the Seller Trademarks in connection
with any goods or services whose nature or quality is not substantially the
same quality of such goods and/or services prior to the Closing.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing _Section 6.19(c)_, nothing therein shall (
_i_ ) require Buyer or its Subsidiaries to take any steps with respect to, or
to destroy, any products (including any packaging), or any service, training,
advertising or other related materials that have already been placed on the
market or otherwise distributed in the ordinary course of conducting the
Transferred Business as conducted immediately prior to the Closing, ( _ii_ )
preclude Buyer or its Subsidiaries from making any reference to the Seller
Trademarks in internal historical, tax, employment or similar records or for
purposes of prospectus and similar disclosures as are reasonably necessary and
appropriate to describe the historical relationship of the Transferred
Business with Seller and its Affiliates, or ( _iii_ ) preclude Buyer or its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) from
making use of the Seller Trademarks in a non-trademark manner for purposes of
conveying to customers or the general public of the change in ownership or
that the name of the business has changed, provided that the use described in
this _Section 6.19(d)(iii)_ shall exist for no more than one hundred twenty
(120) days after Closing.

 

(e) Any and all goodwill arising from or in connection with the use of the
Seller Trademarks by Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing,
the Transferred Companies) shall inure to the benefit of Seller. Buyer, for
itself and its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Transferred
Companies), shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from
and against any and all Losses arising from Buyers and its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) use of the Seller
Trademarks during the Phaseout Period.

 

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge that any damage caused to Seller or any of
its Affiliates by reason of the breach by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) of this _Section
6.19_ would cause irreparable harm that could not be adequately compensated
for in money damages alone; therefore, each party agrees that, in addition to
any other remedies, at law or otherwise, Seller and its Affiliates shall be
entitled to seek an injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction
restraining and enjoining any violation by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) of this _Section
6.19_, and Buyer further agrees, and will cause its Subsidiaries (including,
after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) to further agree, that it and
they will stipulate to the fact that Seller or any of its Affiliates have
been irreparably harmed by such violation and not oppose the granting of such
injunctive relief. Buyer hereby waives, and will cause its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing, the Transferred Companies) to waive, any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy.

 



81 (g) At the Closing, Buyer shall execute, or shall cause the execution of, such
amended organizational documents with respect to the Transferred Companies
such that each Transferred Company can effect a change in its respective name
to a name not containing any of the Seller Trademarks. Immediately after the
Closing, Buyer shall cause the Transferred Companies to file such amended
organizational documents with the applicable Governmental Entity and take all
other necessary action to fulfill its obligations set forth in this _Section
6.19(g)_ as soon as reasonably practicable.

(h) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that on or before the Closing, Seller or its
designee may transfer and migrate to any devices or media at a location or
locations designated by Seller or its designee all copies and versions of any
Seller Owned Software that reside on any of the IT Systems owned by the
Transferred Companies or included in the Transferred Assets;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , Seller or its designee shall leave copies of such Seller Owned
Software on such IT Systems to the extent such Seller Owned Software will be
licensed to Newco and its Affiliates that conduct the Transferred
Business post-Closing pursuant to an Ancillary Document or a software license
agreement entered into pursuant to _Section 6.17(d)_ or _Section 6.17(e)_.

 

(i) From and after the Closing until such date that is five (5) years after
the Closing Date, in the event that a third Person asserts against Buyer or
any of the Transferred Companies a written claim material to the Transferred
Business that the conduct of the Transferred Business as of the Closing
infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates such Persons
Intellectual Property rights, Buyer shall have the right to ask Seller if
Seller obtained, prior to the Closing, a license to use or practice such
asserted Intellectual Property in support of the Transferred Business (a "
_Third Party IP License_ "). After receiving notice from Buyer of such
request, Seller shall either ( _i_ ) notify Buyer that no Third Party IP
License provides that the Transferred Business, as a divested business, may
use or continue to make use of such asserted Intellectual Property, or ( _ii_
)( _A_ ) if a Third Party IP License provides that the Transferred Business,
as a divested business, may continue to make use of such asserted Intellectual
Property (without any need to grant a sublicense thereto), provide a copy of
such Third Party IP License to Buyer if Seller is permitted to do so (or use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such third Persons consent to
disclose such Third Party IP License), or ( _B_ ) if such Third Party IP
License ( _I_ ) includes a sublicensing right that permits Seller or any of
its Affiliates to grant Buyer or the Transferred Companies rights in such
asserted Intellectual Property in respect of the Transferred Business as of
the Closing, and ( _II_ ) requires a sublicense to Buyer or the Transferred
Companies for such asserted Intellectual Property rights to apply to the
Transferred Business as of the Closing, then provided that such a sublicense
does not require the payment of any consideration by Seller, Seller shall
grant to Buyer a sublicense for such asserted Intellectual Property no greater
in scope than Sellers license under such Third Party IP License, solely for
use in the conduct of the Transferred Business as of the Closing.

6.20 _Exclusivity_. From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of
the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, Seller and its
Affiliates shall not (and shall cause their representatives not to) (i)
solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage the submission of any proposal or
offer from any Person relating to the acquisition of all or a majority of the
Transferred Business in any State; or (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, furnish any information with respect to, assist or
participate in, or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by
any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing.

 



82 6.21 _USF Refunds_. To the extent not included in the calculation of Net
Working Capital pursuant to _Section 3.6_, if, after the Closing, Buyer or
its Affiliates ( _A_ ) receive any refund, or ( _B_ ) utilize the benefit of
any overpayment or prepayment of USF contributions which relate to amounts
paid by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred
Companies prior to Closing), Buyer shall promptly transfer, or cause to be
transferred, to Seller the entire amount of the refund or overpayment
(including interest) received or utilized by Buyer or its Affiliates, net of
any Taxes or other costs incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates attributable to
the receipt of such refund. Buyer agrees to notify Seller promptly of both the
discovery of a right to claim any such refund or overpayment and the receipt
of any such refund or utilization of any such overpayment. Buyer agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to claim any such refund or to utilize any
such overpayment as soon as possible and to furnish to Seller
all information, records and assistance necessary to verify the amount of the
refund or overpayment.

6.22 _Publishing Agreements_. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall enter
into a publishing agreement, a non-compete agreement and a branding agreement
with Dex Media, each effective as of the Closing, as required by Sellers
agreements with Dex Media for the States, unless otherwise agreed by Dex
Media.

6.23 _Guarantee Obligations and Liens_.

 

(a) Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to: ( _x_ ) terminate, or to cause Newco,
or the appropriate member of the Buyer Group, to be substituted in all
respects for Seller or the applicable member of the Seller Group in respect
of, all obligations of any member of the Seller Group under any Assumed
Liabilities, performance bonds or other financial underwriting identified by
Seller for which such member of the Seller Group may be liable, as guarantor,
original tenant, primary obligor or otherwise (" _Seller Guarantees_ "), and
( _y_ ) terminate, or to cause reasonably comparable substitute Transferred
Assets to be substituted in all respects for any Excluded Assets in respect
of, any liens or Encumbrances identified by Seller on Excluded Assets which
are securing any Assumed Liabilities. If such a termination or substitution is
not effected by the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Seller,
from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any
member of the Buyer Group to, renew or extend the term of, increase its
monetary obligations (or any other obligations for which Seller or any of its
Affiliates might be liable) under, or transfer to a third party, any loan,
lease, contract or other obligation for which a member of the Seller Group is
or may be liable or for which any Excluded Asset is or may be encumbered
unless all obligations of the Seller Group and all Encumbrances on any
Excluded Asset with respect thereto are thereupon terminated by documentation
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Seller. Buyer further agrees
that to the extent Seller or any of its Affiliates incurs any Losses in
connection with such Seller Guarantees on or after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller against, and reimburse Seller
for, any and all Losses, including costs or expenses in connection with such
Seller Guarantees, including Sellers expenses in maintaining such Seller
Guarantees, whether or not any such Seller Guarantee is drawn upon or required
to be

 



83  performed, and shall in any event promptly reimburse Seller to the extent
any Seller Guarantee is called upon and Seller or any of its Affiliates incurs
any Losses in connection with the Seller Guarantees; _provided_ that the
foregoing indemnity shall not apply with respect to any out-of-pocket cost or
expense to be borne by Seller, as described in this _Section 6.23(a)_.

 

(b) Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to: ( _x_ ) terminate, or to cause a
member of the Seller Group to be substituted in all respects for any
Transferred Company in respect of, all obligations of any Transferred Company
under any Excluded Liabilities for which such Transferred Company may be
liable, as guarantor, original tenant, primary obligor or otherwise ("
_Transferred Company Guarantees_ "), and ( _y_ ) terminate, or cause
reasonably comparable substitute Excluded Assets to be substituted in all
respects for any Transferred Assets in respect of, any liens or Encumbrances
on Transferred Assets which are securing any Excluded Liabilities. If such a
termination or substitution is not effected by the Closing Date, without the
prior written consent of Buyer, from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall
not, and shall not permit any member of the Seller Group to, renew or extend
the term of, increase its monetary obligations (or any other obligations
for which Buyer or any of its Affiliates might be liable) under, or transfer
to a third party, any loan, lease, contract or other obligation for which any
of the Transferred Companies is or may be liable or for which any Transferred
Asset is or may be encumbered unless all obligations of the Transferred
Companies and all Encumbrances on any Transferred Asset with respect thereto
are thereupon terminated by documentation reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to Buyer. Seller further agrees that to the extent any of the
Transferred Companies incurs any Losses in connection with such Transferred
Company Guarantees on or after the Closing Date, Seller shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Transferred Companies against, and reimburse the
Transferred Companies for, any and all Losses, and shall in any event promptly
reimburse the Transferred Companies to the extent any Transferred Company
Guarantee is called upon and any Transferred Company incurs any Losses
in connection with such Transferred Company Guarantees.

with their terms and any claim for Losses in respect of a breach of a covenant
for which this Agreement contemplated performance prior to Closing must be

Date it shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, each of Sellers
Subsidiaries, and their respective directors, officers, shareholders,
partners, members, attorneys, accountants, agents, representatives
and employees and their heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each in
their capacity as such (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from, against
and in respect of any claims, damages, losses, charges, Liabilities, actions,
suits, proceedings, judgments, settlements, assessments, interest, penalties,
and reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") actually incurred or suffered by any of
the Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting from, ( _i_ ) any
breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in _Article V_ of this
Agreement (including as if such representations and warranties were made as of
the Effective Time (except for such representations and warranties that are
made as of a specific date)) for the period such representation or warranty
survives, ( _ii_ ) except to the extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties are
entitled to be indemnified in respect thereof (without giving effect to the
limitations contained in _Section 8.1_ or _8.3_ (b)), any of the Assumed
Liabilities, ( _iii_ ) any breach of a covenant or agreement of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates contained in this Agreement and ( _iv_ ) except to the
extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to be indemnified in
respect thereof (without giving effect to the limitations contained in
_Section 8.1_ or  _8.3_ (b)), any Liabilities that Buyer has expressly
agreed to assume pursuant to this Agreement.

8.3 _Indemnification by Seller_.

(a) Seller hereby agrees that from and after the Closing it shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates, and their respective
directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, attorneys, accountants,
agents, representatives and employees (other than the Business Employees) and
their heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each in their capacity as such
(the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ " and, collectively with the Seller

 



87  Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from, against and in
respect of any Losses actually incurred or suffered by any of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting from ( _i_ ) subject to
_Section 8.3(b)_, any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller
in _Article IV_ of this Agreement (including as if such representations and
warranties were made as of the Effective Time (except for such
representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date)) for the
period such representation or warranty survives, ( _ii_ ) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement, ( _iii_ ) any of
the Excluded Liabilities, ( _iv_ ) all USF contributions that relate to the
Transferred Business prior to the Closing, and ( _v_ ) any Indebtedness of the

taking into account the Pre-Closing Reorganization) and not reflected on the
Final Closing Statement.

 

(b) Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses
with respect to the matters contained in  _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ unless the
Losses therefrom exceed an aggregate amount equal to $131,750,000 (the "
_Indemnity Threshold_ ") and then only for Losses in excess of that amount and
up to an aggregate amount equal to $1,054,000,000 (the " _Indemnity Cap_ ").
Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of any
individual claim or series of claims arising out of a similar occurrence or
set of facts for indemnification under  _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ involving Losses
of less than $300,000 and no such amounts shall be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying the Indemnity Threshold. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the limitations set forth in this  _Section 8.3(b)_ shall not apply to any
claims for Losses resulting from or arising out of breaches of the Specified
Representations or _Section 4.9(l)_ or due to fraud by or on behalf of
Seller.

 

(c) For purposes of this _Article VIII_ , any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
"material", "materially", "in all material respects", "in any material
respect", "material to the Transferred Business" and " _Seller Material
Adverse Effect_ " qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty, _provided_ that ( _A_ ) such qualifiers shall not
be disregarded in _Section 4.7(d)_ (Financial Statements), _Section 4.8_
(Litigation and Claims), _Section 4.10(i)_ (Employees and Employee
Benefits), _Section 4.15(a)_ (Contracts), _Section 4.16_ (Absence of
Changes), the first sentence of _Section 4.18_ (Communications Licenses) or 
_Section 4.19_ (Title to Property), and ( _B_ ) the word "material" shall not
be disregarded where it immediately precedes ( _1_ ) the term "Seller Benefit
Plan" in _Section 4.10_ (Employees and Employee Benefits) and ( _2_ ) the
term "Governmental Authorizations" in _Section 4.12_ (Compliance with Laws;
Communications Authorizations). The rights of an Indemnified Party to
indemnification under this Agreement or any Ancillary Documents shall not be
affected by any investigation conducted or actual or constructive knowledge
acquired at any time by such Indemnified Party, whether before or after the
date of this Agreement or any Closing Date.

 

8.4 _Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which an indemnifying party (an
" _Indemnifying Party_ ") may have liability to any Indemnified Party
hereunder is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified
Party by a third party (other than a claim by a Taxing authority for Taxes) (a
" _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no
event more than thirty (30) days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of
a Third-

 



88  Party Claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third-Party
Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder (which
estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Third-Party
Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints
relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details
pertaining thereto (a " _Claim Notice_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure timely to give a Claim Notice shall affect the rights of an
Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that such failure has an
adverse effect on the resolution of the Third-Party Claim or on the defenses
or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify
the Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against
such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, to the extent that Buyer reasonably expects that the Losses resulting
from a Third-Party Claim would not, when aggregated with all other Losses for
which Seller has previously indemnified Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to indemnify Buyer Indemnified
Parties in the future (based on information available at such time), exceed
the Indemnity Threshold, Buyer shall have the right to defend such Third-Party
Claim and shall have the sole power to direct and control such defense.

 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall have the
sole power to direct and control such defense. Once the Indemnifying Party has
duly assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense. If
the Indemnified Party shall participate in any such defense, it shall
participate at its sole cost and expense unless ( _i_ ) the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party are both named parties to the proceedings and
the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate, due to a non-
waivable conflict, or ( _ii_ ) the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of a
Third-Party Claim after the Indemnifying Party has failed to diligently pursue
a Third-Party Claim it has assumed, in which case the Indemnifying Party
shall be liable for the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of one
separate counsel (in addition to any necessary local counsel) to the extent
such Third-Party Claim is subject to indemnification or reimbursement under 
_Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or
offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim on a basis that would
result in ( _i_ ) the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree
that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party, (
_ii_ ) a finding or admission of a violation of Law or violation of the rights
of any Person by the Indemnified Party, ( _iii_ ) a finding or admission that
would have an adverse effect on other claims made or threatened against the
Indemnified Party, or ( _iv_ ) except to the extent within the amounts set
forth in  _Section 8.3(b)_ if applicable, any monetary liability of the
Indemnified Party that will not be paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying
Party.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party ( _i_ ) elects not to defend the Indemnified
Party against a Third-Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified
Party timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise, ( _ii_ ) is not
entitled to defend the Third-Party Claim as a result of the Indemnified
Partys election to defend the Third-Party Claim as provided in  _Section
8.4(b) _

 



89  hereof, or ( _iii_ ) after assuming the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right but not the obligation to
provide its own defense and shall consult with the Indemnifying Party
regarding the strategy for defense of such claim, including with respect to
the Indemnified Partys choice of legal counsel;  _it_ _being_ _understood_
_that_ the Indemnified Partys right to indemnification for a Third-Party
Claim shall not be adversely affected by whether it assumes the defense of
such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall have no liability with
respect to a Third-Party Claim settled in violation of the last sentence of
_Section 8.4(b)_.

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim, including by
providing access to each others relevant business records and other
documents, and employees (including, if necessary, availability for
depositions and testifying); _it_ _being_ _understood_ _that_ the reasonable
and documented costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party relating thereto
shall be considered Losses. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall keep each other fully informed with respect to the status of such Third-
Party Claim.

 

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential
information (consistent with applicable Law), and to cause all communications
among employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third-Party
Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-
product privileges (if applicable).

(f) Each of Buyer and Seller hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction
of any court in which a Third-Party Claim is brought for purposes of any
claim for indemnification or reimbursement with respect to such Third-Party
Claim or the matters alleged therein.

 

8.5 _Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no Person shall be liable under this  _Article
VIII_ for any consequential, punitive, special or exemplary damages,
regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, strict liability
or otherwise, and whether or not such damages were foreseen or unforeseen,
except to the extent awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction in
connection with a Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall limit an Indemnified Partys ability to recover lost profits or
diminution in value to the extent they are reasonably foreseeable damages
from the applicable matter that is the subject of an indemnity claim.

8.6 _Limitation on Indemnification by Seller_. Seller shall not be required
to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from,
against or in respect of any Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties arising out of or resulting from any Liability to the
extent the amount of such Liability is included in the calculation of Final
Net Working Capital.

 



90 8.7 _Adjustments to Losses_.

 

(a) _Insurance_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any
insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by
or against any other Person, net of any actual costs, expenses or premiums
incurred in connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds, shall be
deducted, except to the extent that the adjustment itself would excuse,
exclude or limit the coverage of all or part of such Loss. In the event that
an Indemnified Party has any rights against a third party with respect to any
occurrence, claim or loss that results in a payment by an Indemnifying Party
under this _Article VIII_ , such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to
such rights to the extent of such payment; _provided_ _that_ until the
Indemnified Party recovers full payment of the Loss, any and all claims of
the Indemnifying Party against any such third party on account of said
indemnity payment is hereby expressly made subordinate and subject in right of
payment to the Indemnified Partys rights against such third party. Without
limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, each
Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall duly execute upon request all
instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the subrogation
and subordination rights detailed herein, and otherwise cooperate in the
prosecution of such claims.

(b) _Reimbursements and Adjustments_. In calculating the amount of any Loss
for which either party is entitled to indemnification hereunder, to the extent
such Loss is otherwise recovered by a party pursuant to other terms of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document, such amount actually recovered shall be
deducted from the amount owed for such Loss, so that the same amount shall not
be paid more than once.

 

(c) _Reimbursement_. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third
party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder
after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit
to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of ( _A_ ) the amount paid by
the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount received from
the third party in respect thereof (net of any actual costs or expenses
incurred in connection with obtaining such amount), less ( _B_ ) the full
amount of the Loss.

8.8 _Payments_. The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable pursuant
to this  _Article VIII_ promptly following receipt from an Indemnified Party
of a claim for a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder, unless
and for so long as the Indemnifying Party in good faith disputes such claim in
which event it shall so notify the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
agrees to provide reasonable supplementary documentation for all claims they
make under this _Article VIII_. In any event, the Indemnifying Party shall pay
to the Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
the amount of any Loss for which it is liable hereunder no later than three
(3) Business Days following any Final Determination of such Loss and the
Indemnifying Partys liability therefor. 

8.9 _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. Except as otherwise
required by Law, all payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified
Party in respect of any claim pursuant to _Section 6.23_, _Section 8.2_ or
_Section 8.3_ hereof shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes.

 

8.10 _Mitigation_. Nothing herein shall prevent an Indemnifying Party from
asserting that the amount of such Loss incurred by an Indemnified Party for
which indemnification is sought hereunder may take into account the
Indemnified Partys failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
such Loss; it being understood that any such assertion shall not
be dispositive in determining the amount of such Loss.

 



91 8.11 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly specified in this Agreement,
the rights and remedies of Seller and Buyer under this _Article VIII_ are
exclusive following the Closing and in lieu of any and all other rights and
remedies which Seller and Buyer may have under this Agreement or otherwise for
monetary relief with respect to the subject matter hereof. The parties
covenant not to sue, assert any arbitration claim or otherwise threaten any
claim other than those described in this _Article VIII_ as being available
under the particular circumstances described in this _Article VIII_.

8.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that any breach
of this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which monetary
damages would not be an adequate remedy. The parties accordingly agree that,
in addition to any other rights or remedies it may have at law or in equity,
the other party shall be entitled to ( _x_ ) enforce the terms of this
Agreement by decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving
the inadequacy of monetary damages as a remedy and ( _y_ ) seek injunctive
relief against any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Neither
party will contest an action by the other party for injunctive relief or an
order of specific performance on the basis that there is an adequate remedy at
law, or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason, at law or in equity. The parties agree to not seek and agree
to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of a bond in connection
with a party seeking or obtaining any relief pursuant to this _Section
8.12_. 

_ARTICLE IX_

 

 _TERMINATION_

9.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller;

 

(b) by either Buyer or Seller, by giving written notice of such termination to
the other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred by the date that is
fourteen months after the date hereof (as extended pursuant to this _Section
9.1_, the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
that, as of such date, all Closing conditions other than the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.1(a)_, _Section 7.1(b)_, _Section 7.2(a)_, _Section
7.2(e)_, _Section 7.2(f)_ or _Section 7.3(a)_ are satisfied, waived or
capable of being satisfied as of such date (assuming for such purpose that
such date were the Closing Date), then the Termination Date may be extended by
either Buyer or Seller on one or more occasions upon written notice to the
other party and the period of each such extension shall be for a one month
period, not to exceed four (4) calendar months in the aggregate, to satisfy
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(a)_, _Section 7.1(b)_, _Section
7.2(a)_,  _Section 7.2(e)_, _Section 7.2(f)_ and _Section 7.3(a)_;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if Buyer shall have delivered the notice
contemplated by the proviso of clause (i) of _Section 3.3_, neither Buyer
nor Seller may terminate this Agreement until the second Business Day of the
immediately following month;

 



92 (c) by either Buyer or Seller, by giving written notice of such termination to
the other party, if any Order prohibiting the Closing shall become final and
non-appealable;

(d) by Buyer if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by Seller in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement, such that _Section 7.2(b)_ or _7.2(d)_ would not be
satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not
cured within the earlier of ( _i_ ) sixty (60) days after written notice
thereof is given by Buyer to Seller and ( _ii_ ) the Termination Date; or

 

(e) by Seller if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement, or any
such representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of
this Agreement, such that _Section 7.3(b)_ or _7.3(c)_ would not be
satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not
cured within the earlier of ( _i_ ) sixty (60) days after written notice
thereof is given by Seller to Buyer and ( _ii_ ) the Termination Date.

 

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall thereafter become
void and have no further effect, and no party hereto shall have any liability
to the other party hereto or their respective Affiliates, directors, officers
or employees, except for the obligations of the parties hereto contained in
this _Section 9.2_ and in the last sentence of _Section 6.1_ (Access and
Information), and in _Section 10.1_ (Notices), _Section 10.2_ (Amendment;
Waiver), _Section 10.3_ (No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties),
_Section 10.4_ (Entire Agreement), _Section 10.6_ (Public Disclosure),

Recourse) hereof (and any related definitional provisions set forth in

any party from liability for any fraud or willful or material breach of this
Agreement that arose prior to such termination.

10.2 _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
waived if such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of
an amendment, by the parties hereto, or in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this  _Section
10.2_, _Section 10.3_, _Section 9.2_,

 



94   _Section 10.11_ and _Section 10.17_, to the extent affecting any of the
Financing Sources, may not be amended, modified, waived or supplemented
(including any defined term used therein) in a manner adverse to any of the
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of each such affected
Financing Source.

 

10.3 _No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign any of its rights or
delegate any of its duties or obligations under this Agreement, by operation
of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party
hereto,  _provided_ that Buyer may, by written notice, assign any and all of
its rights under this Agreement ( _A_ ) to one or more of its wholly owned
Subsidiaries or ( _B_ ) to the Committed Financing Sources for collateral
security purposes (but no such assignment referred to in the foregoing clause
(A) or (B) shall relieve Buyer of any of its duties or obligations hereunder).
Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
Person other than Buyer, Seller, the Indemnified Parties and their respective
successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement, except for the rights of the
Financing Sources pursuant to this  _Section 10.3_, _Section 10.2_,
_Section 9.2_, _Section 10.11_ and _Section 10.17_ and Outside Counsel
pursuant to _Section 10.18_.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not convey, transfer or lease its
properties and assets substantially as an entirety to any Person, unless the
Person which acquires by conveyance or transfer, or which leases, the
properties and assets of Buyer substantially as an entirety shall expressly
assume, by an instrument in writing, executed and delivered to Seller, in form
reasonably satisfactory to Seller, the due and punctual payment of any
amounts due from Buyer at or prior to the Closing hereunder and the
performance or observance of every covenant of this Agreement on the part of
Buyer to be performed or observed at or prior to the Closing.

10.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Confidentiality
Agreement, and all Disclosure Schedules, Annexes and Exhibits hereto) and the
Ancillary Documents contain the entire agreement between the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such matters, except for
the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect
until the Closing.

10.5 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any party to any other
party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have
been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

10.6 _Public Disclosure_. Each party hereto shall obtain consent of the other
party (such consent to be not unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld),
prior to issuing any press releases regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except as required by Law or by any
Governmental Entity and except to the extent that the text of such release is
substantially similar to text that has previously been publicly disclosed by
Seller or Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or is
substantially similar to any mutually agreed

 



95  upon communication plan. In the case of any such press release to be made as
required by Law or by any such Governmental Entity, the party proposing to
make such disclosure shall provide the other party a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on any reference to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, prior to issuing or making any such press release (and
such disclosing party shall review and consider any such comments in good
faith). To the extent practicable, each party shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause any other public announcements or public disclosures (other
than press releases) with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any Ancillary Documents to be consistent with the parties
prior disclosures and any mutually agreed upon communication plan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may, in connection with the Financing,
disclose information concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents of the type typically included in a
public debt offering on Form S-3 where the proceeds are to be used by an
operating company in the telecommunications industry to finance an
acquisition, including pro forma financial information and a summary of the
transaction, this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, after providing
Seller a reasonable opportunity to review such disclosure and acting in good
faith to take into account the reasonable comments of Seller; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer will not disclose any information that is competitively
sensitive to Seller, without obtaining Sellers prior written consent. To the
extent a party is obligated to file this Agreement or any Ancillary Document
publicly with any Governmental Entity, such party shall give the non-
disclosing party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment (and shall in
good faith take into account the comments of such party) on the scope of any
redactions and requests for confidential treatment of the terms hereof.

10.7 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or
the Ancillary Documents, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents are consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be borne by the party
incurring such expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, whether or
not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents are consummated, any fees or expenses incurred by any of Seller, its
Subsidiaries of the Transferred Companies or any of their
respective Affiliates (including the fees and expenses of legal counsel, any
accountant, auditor, broker, financial advisor or consultant retained by them
or on their behalf) in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be the responsibility
of, and paid by, Seller.

 

10.8 _Bulk Sales_. Seller and Buyer (on behalf of themselves and their
Subsidiaries) agree to waive compliance with Article 6 of the Uniform
Commercial Code and other bulk sales Laws as adopted in each of the
jurisdictions in which any of the Transferred Assets are located to the extent
that such Article is applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.

10.9 _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) From time to time after the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause
its applicable Subsidiaries to, promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver any
other documents and take such further actions as may be reasonably requested
by Buyer and necessary for Buyer to satisfy its obligations hereunder or under
the Ancillary Documents.

 



96 (b) From time to time after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver any other
documents and take such further actions as may be reasonably requested by
Seller and necessary for Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to satisfy its
obligations hereunder or under the Ancillary Documents.

(c) If after the Closing Date, Seller or its Affiliate (other than a
Transferred Company), on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand (the "
_Receiving Party_ "), receives any funds which belong to the other party (the
" _Entitlement Party_ ") under this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, the
Receiving Party shall hold such funds in trust for, and immediately pay over
such funds to, the Entitlement Party.

(d) In the event it is determined following the Closing that ( _i_ ) any
asset that constitutes a Transferred Asset should have been transferred to the
Transferred Companies pursuant to _Section 2.1_ but was not so transferred,
such asset shall be promptly transferred, without the payment of additional
consideration by Buyer or the Transferred Companies, to the applicable
Transferred Company, and shall upon such transfer constitute a Transferred
Asset and ( _ii_ ) any Liability that constitutes an Assumed Liability that
should have been assumed by the Transferred Companies pursuant to _Section
2.3_ but was not assumed pursuant to an instrument of assumption, such
Liability shall be promptly assumed by the applicable Transferred Company (and
Buyer shall cause the applicable Transferred Company to assume such
Liability), without the payment of additional consideration by Seller,
pursuant to an instrument of assumption.

 

(e) In the event it is determined following the Closing that ( _i_ ) any asset
that is not a Transferred Asset and should not have been transferred to, or
held by, the Transferred Companies pursuant to _Section 2.1_ but was
transferred to, or held by, the Transferred Companies, such asset shall be
promptly transferred (and Buyer shall cause the applicable
Transferred Company to transfer such asset), without the payment of
consideration by Seller, to Seller, and shall upon such transfer not
constitute a Transferred Asset or ( _ii_ ) any Liability that is an Excluded
Liability that should not have been assumed or retained by the Transferred
Companies pursuant to _Section 2.3_ but was assumed pursuant to an instrument
of assumption or retained by the Transferred Companies, such Liability shall
be promptly assumed by Seller, without the payment of additional
consideration by Buyer, pursuant to an instrument of assumption.

(f) The obligations of Buyer and Seller under subsections ( _a_ ), ( _b_ ), (
_d_ ), ( _e_ ) and ( _f_ ) of this _Section 10.9_ shall terminate on the date
that is one year following the Closing Date.

 

10.10 _Disclaimer of Other Representations or Warranties_. EACH PARTY AGREES
THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS, NEITHER BUYER NOR SELLER MAKES OR RELIES
ON ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, AND EACH HEREBY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR INDUCEMENTS, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY OTHER INFORMATION
(INCLUDING IN ANY

 



97  DATAROOM OR MANAGEMENT PRESENTATION OR INFORMATION MEMORANDUM OR IN RESPONSE
TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY A PARTY OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES AND INCLUDING
ANY PROJECTIONS OR SIMILAR INFORMATION), MADE BY, OR MADE AVAILABLE BY,
ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, WITH RESPECT
TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS OR THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND THE ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS, NOTWITHSTANDING
THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR THE OTHER PARTYS
REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY
ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN _Article IV_ OR THE ANCILLARY
DOCUMENTS, (I) NEITHER SELLER NOR ANY OTHER PERSON MAKES ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ON BEHALF OF SELLER, AND, NOTWITHSTANDING
ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, SELLER MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY EXCLUDED ASSETS AND (II) THE
TRANSFERRED ASSETS AND TRANSFERRED COMPANIES ARE ASSIGNED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY,
INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF OR RELATED TO TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

 

10.11 _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Selection of Forum; Waiver
of Jury Trial_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ITS
PRINCIPLES OR RULES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS, TO THE EXTENT SUCH PRINCIPLES OR
RULES ARE NOT MANDITORILY APPLICABLE BY STATUTE AND WOULD PERMIT OR REQUIRE
THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION. Each party hereto agrees
that it shall bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising
out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contained in or
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents (including any
action or proceeding involving any Financing Sources), exclusively in courts
of the State of New York located in the Borough of Manhattan or Federal courts
of the United States of America located in the Southern District of New York
(the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and solely in connection with claims arising under
this Agreement or the transactions contained in or contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents (a) irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (b) waives any objection to
laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (c) waives
any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have
jurisdiction over any party hereto, (d) agrees that service of process upon
such party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is
given in accordance with _Section 10.1_ of this Agreement and (e) agrees not
to bring or permit any of their controlled Affiliates to bring any such action
or proceeding in any court other than the Chosen Courts. EACH OF THE PARTIES
HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING ANY
FINANCING SOURCES).

 



98  The provisions of this _Section 10.11_ shall inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, each Financing Source, each of which is hereby intended to
be an express third-party beneficiary of this _Section 10.11_.

10.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and
the same Agreement.

10.13 _Headings_. The heading references herein and the table of contents
hereof are for convenience purposes only, and shall not be deemed to limit or
affect any of the provisions hereof.

 

10.14 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, ( _a_ ) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and ( _b_ ) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

10.15 _Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and
drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
jointly drafted by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

10.16 _Payments_. No party hereto shall be entitled to payment under any
provision of this Agreement for any amount to the extent payment with respect
to the same matter is recovered by such Person or its Affiliates or such
amount is otherwise included or taken into consideration under any other
provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document such that such party
would be unfairly enriched.

10.17 _No Recourse_. No Financing Source shall have any liability for any
obligations or liabilities hereunder of the parties to this Agreement or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. Without limiting the rights of Seller against Buyer (including in
connection with causing Buyer to enforce its rights against the Financing
Sources), Seller (on behalf of itself and its stockholders, partners, members,
Affiliates, directors, officers and employees, representatives and agents)
hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by law any rights or claims
against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement or the
Commitment Letter or any other commitment or engagement with respect to any
Financing or Alternative Financing, whether in law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise.

 



99 10.18 _Conflicts; Privilege_. Recognizing that Debevoise and Plimpton LLP and
certain other law firms or outside counsel (each an " _Outside Counsel_ ")
have acted as legal counsel to Seller, the Transferred Companies and certain
of their respective Affiliates prior to date hereof, and that Debevoise and
Plimpton LLP intends to act as legal counsel to Seller and its Affiliates
after the Closing (which will no longer include the Transferred Companies),
Buyer hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates, the
Transferred Companies and its Subsidiaries to waive, any conflicts that may
arise in connection with Debevoise and Plimpton LLP representing Seller or its
Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer, the
Transferred Companies or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition,
all communications involving attorney-client confidences between Seller, its
Subsidiaries, the Transferred Companies and their respective Affiliates, on
the one hand, and such Outside Counsel or internal counsel of Seller or any
of its Affiliates, on the other hand, in the course of the negotiation,
documentation, preparation, execution, delivery and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or any dispute or proceeding arising under
or in connection with this Agreement (including in any claim for
indemnification brought by Buyer), shall be deemed to be attorney-client
confidences that belong solely to Seller and its Affiliates (and not the
Transferred Companies). Accordingly, the Transferred Companies shall not have
access to any such communications or to the files of such Outside Counsel or
such internal counsel relating to such engagement from and after the Closing
and none of Buyer, the Transferred Companies or any Person acting or
purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyer or the Transferred Companies
shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege
attaching to such communications belongs to Buyer or the Transferred
Companies. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after
the Closing, ( _a_ ) Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Transferred
Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege
with respect to such engagement, and none of the Transferred Companies shall
be a holder thereof, ( _b_ ) to the extent that files of such Outside Counsel
or such internal counsel in respect of such engagement constitute property of
the client, only Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Transferred
Companies) shall hold such property rights and ( _c_ ) such Outside Counsel or
such internal counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any
such attorney-client communications or files to the Transferred Companies by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between such Outside Counsel or
such internal counsel and the Transferred Companies or otherwise. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this  _Section 10.18_ shall apply to any
