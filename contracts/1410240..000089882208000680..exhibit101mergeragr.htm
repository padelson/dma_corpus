 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 13, 2008 (this " _Agreement_ ") by and between Polaris Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Hughes Telematics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

 

WITNESSETH:

 

 WHEREAS, the Parent Board of Directors and the Company Board of Directors have determined that it is in the best interest of their respective companies and their shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement and approved the transactions set forth herein pursuant to which the Company will, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into Parent (the " _Merger_ "), with Parent continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to in this capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "); and 

 

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, the Company, Parent and the holders of Company Common Stock (as defined below) and other equity securities of the Company (the " _Company Equityholders_ ") are entering into a Support and Reorganization Agreement, of even date herewith, in respect of the equity securities held by such Company Equityholders (the " _Company Support Agreement_ "); and

 

 WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and 

 

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

 

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 Section 2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 251 of the DGCL.

 

 Section 2.5 _Organizational Documents; Governance_.

 

 (a) _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_. The Certificate of Incorporation of Parent (as amended prior to the Effective Time as contemplated by this Agreement in the form as set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time until thereafter amended. The Bylaws of Parent (as amended prior to the Effective Time as

  contemplated by this Agreement in the form as set forth on _Exhibit C_
hereto), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time until
thereafter amended.

 

 (b) _Board of Directors; Officers_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent Board of Directors shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full Parent Board of Directors at or immediately prior to the Effective Time (and the Surviving Corporation, at and after the Effective Time) to be nine. Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause (i) the members of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time to consist of the persons listed as directors on _Exhibit D_ hereto and (ii) the officers of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time to consist of the persons listed as officers on _Exhibit D_ hereto. 

 

 Section 2.6 _Effect on Capital Stock and Additional Share Consideration_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder of any of the following securities: 

 

 (a) Each share of common stock, $0.0001 par value, of Parent (the " _Parent_ _Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger. 

 

 (b) All shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are owned directly by the Company shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

 

 (c) Other than the shares cancelled pursuant to Section 2.6(b), any shares owned by Company Stockholders properly exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") (which shares shall have the rights as provided in Section 2.6(h)), and subject to Section 2.6(e), each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and represent the right to receive a number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the aggregate of such shares referred to as the " _Transaction Shares_ "); _provided_ that 7.5% of the Transaction Shares shall be deposited into escrow to satisfy the indemnity set forth in Article VII hereof in accordance with Section 2.10 hereof; _provided_ , _further_ , the Applicable Percentage of the Transaction Shares shall be designated as the " _Escrowed Earnout_ _Shares_ " and the right to receive the Escrowed Earnout Shares shall be contingent upon the satisfaction of the Targets set forth in Section 2.8 hereof in accordance with Section 2.8 hereof. The " _Applicable Percentage_ " shall be a fraction equal to (1) 29,000,000, divided by (2) the sum of (A) the aggregate number of Transaction Shares, plus (B) the aggregate number of Converted Option Shares. Parent shall deposit the Escrowed Earnout Shares with the Escrow Agent, which shares shall consist of three tranches, each of which shall consist of one-third of the total Escrowed Earnout Shares (each, a " _Tranche_ "), which may be released to the Company Stockholders or cancelled in accordance with Section 2.8. Section 2.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Statement sets forth, as of the date hereof, the allocation of Transaction Shares (including the Escrowed Earnout Shares) among all of the holders of the Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") immediately prior to the Effective Time, after giving effect 

  to the Reorganization Actions (and shall also set forth the allocation of
Transaction Shares assuming the outstanding Credit Facility Warrants are not
exercised prior to the Effective Time). Section 2.6(c) of the Company
Disclosure Statement may be revised, if necessary, at least 48 hours prior to
the Proxy Statement Date and, again, at least 48 hours prior to the Effective
Time, in each case pursuant to Section 6.17 hereof.

 

 (d) Each share of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to this Article II shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and the certificates previously representing such shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Certificates_ ") shall thereafter represent solely the right to receive the Transaction Shares, subject to the conditions set forth in this Article II and the Escrow Agreement. 

 

 (e) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, and each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise receive) shall, upon compliance with Section 2.9 hereof, receive from Parent, in lieu of such fractional share, an amount in cash without interest thereon equal to the product of (i) such fraction multiplied by (ii) the volume-weighted average price of one share of Parent Common Stock, as reported by Bloomberg, L.P., on the last trading day prior to the Effective Time.

 

 (f) Upon and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, each Company Option granted under the Company Stock Plan and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an option (each, a " _Converted_ _Option_ ") to acquire a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (" _Converted Option Shares_ ") equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that would have been issuable upon the exercise of such Company Option for cash immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share. Converted Options representing the Applicable Percentage of Converted Option Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) shall be designated as " _Earnout_ _Options_ " and all remaining Converted Options shall be designated as " _Transaction Options_." The Earnout Options shall be further divided into three separate sub-categories, each of which shall consist of Earnout Options in respect of one-third of the total number of Converted Option Shares applicable to Earnout Options as follows (it being understood that each category of Earnout Options shall consist of whole shares so that the three categories may not pertain to exactly the same number of shares but shall be as close to equivalent as possible): (A) the first category of Earnout Options shall be exercisable only if (i) they are otherwise exercisable pursuant to the vesting and other terms and conditions of the Company Option (except as set forth in Section 2.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Statement) and (ii) the First Target Shares are released to Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 2.8, (B) the second category of Earnout Options shall be exercisable only if (i) they are otherwise exercisable pursuant to the vesting and other terms and conditions of the Company Option (except as set forth in Section 2.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Statement) and (ii) the Second Target Shares are released to Company Stockholders pursuant to Section 2.8 and (C) the third category of Earnout Options shall be exercisable only if (i) they are otherwise exercisable pursuant to the vesting and other terms and conditions of the Company Option (except as set forth in Section 2.6(f) of the Company 

  Disclosure Statement) and (ii) the Third Target Shares are released to Company
Stockholders pursuant to Section 2.8. If any Tranche of Escrowed Earnout
Shares is cancelled, the category of Earnout Options that would otherwise
become exercisable upon the release of such Escrowed Earnout Shares shall also
be cancelled at such time. The per share exercise price of each Converted
Option rounded up to the nearest whole cent shall be the same as the per share
exercise price of the related Company Option divided by the Exchange Ratio.
Section 2.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Statement sets forth the allocation
of the Converted Options, by category, among all holders of Company Options as
of the date of this Agreement. Section 2.6(f) of the Company Disclosure
Statement may be revised, if necessary, at least 48 hours prior to the Proxy
Statement Date and, again, at least 48 hours prior to the Effective Time.
Except as set forth above, each Converted Option shall be on the same terms
and conditions (including vesting conditions) as the applicable Company Option
it replaces. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the Company, the Company
Board of Directors and the compensation committee of the Company Board of
Directors, as applicable, shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 2.6(f) .

 

 (g) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to all of the Converted Option Shares and shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as any such Converted Options remain outstanding. 

 

 (h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any Company Stockholder that is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to, and complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Transaction Shares as provided in (but subject to) this Article II, but, instead, such Company Stockholder shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and automatically shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and, except as otherwise provided by Laws, each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to the Appraisal Shares, other than such rights as are granted by Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such Company Stockholder shall fail to validly perfect or shall otherwise waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such Company Stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the rights of such Company Stockholder under Section 262 shall cease, and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Transaction Shares as provided in (but subject to) this Article II. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the opportunity to reasonably participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

 

 Section 2.7 _Reorganization Actions_. 

  (a) Prior to the Closing (and no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time), the Company shall cause (and the Company Equityholders shall cause, pursuant to the Company Support Agreement) the actions set forth on _Exhibit G_ (the " _Reorganization Actions_ ") to take effect.

 

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event any Credit Facility Warrants are not exercised prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall effect the automatic exercise of such Credit Facility Warrants immediately following the Effective Time pursuant to the terms thereof, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to amend the terms and provisions of this Agreement as reasonably necessary to ensure that such timing difference in the exercise of the Credit Facility Warrants has no economic effect on the Transaction or the relative rights of the parties hereunder (including, without limitation, providing for the escrow of the applicable portion of the issuable Parent Common Stock as Escrowed Earnout Shares and Escrowed Indemnity Shares). 

 

 Section 2.8 _Earnout_.

 

 (a) On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit all of the Escrowed Earnout Shares with the Escrow Agent, to be held in an escrow account for the purpose of distributing such shares to the Company Stockholders upon the achievement of certain targets, as described in this Section 2.8, _provided_ that 7.5% of such Escrowed Earnout Shares shall be part of the Escrowed Indemnity Shares and placed in a separate escrow account in satisfaction of the indemnity set forth in Article VII hereof in accordance with Section 2.10 hereof. The Escrowed Earnout Shares shall be allocated to the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 2.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Statement and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Section 2.8 and an agreement to be entered into at the Closing between Parent, the Escrow Representative, and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") (or another escrow agent mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company), in customary form and substance as reasonably agreed to by Parent and the Company (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

 

 (b) Subject to Section 2.8(e) hereof, if between the first and the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the Closing Price of Parent Common Stock equals or exceeds $20.00 per share (the " _First Target_ ") for 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period, then within ten Business Days after the achievement of such target, Parent and the Escrow Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release one Tranche of Escrowed Earnout Shares (which amount may be reduced by up to 7.5% of such shares (the " _First Target Indemnity_ _Shares_ ") pursuant to Article VII hereof and the Escrow Agreement), which shares shall be allocated to the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 2.6(c) hereof and Section 2.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Statement (the " _First Target Shares_ "). 

 

 (c) Subject to Section 2.8(e) hereof, if between the second and the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, the Closing Price of Parent Common Stock equals or exceeds $24.50 per share (the " _Second Target_ ") for 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period, then within ten Business Days after the achievement of such target, Parent and the Escrow Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release (i) one Tranche of Escrowed Earnout Shares (which amount may be reduced by up to 7.5% of such shares (the " _Second Target_ _Indemnity Shares_ ") pursuant to Article VII hereof and the Escrow Agreement), which shares 

  shall be allocated to the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section

in Section 2.8(b) and the Second Target has not been achieved for such 20
trading days during the two-year period referenced in this Section 2.8(c), the
First Target Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be cancelled.

 (f) The target closing price triggers listed in Sections 2.8(b), (c) and (d) hereof (such dollar amounts, the " _Closing Price Triggers_ ") and the Escrowed Earnout Shares to be distributed upon achievement of said targets shall be adjusted from time to time as follows: 

 

 (i) In the event the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall be subdivided or reclassified into a greater number of shares of Parent Common Stock, the Closing Price Triggers in effect at the close of business on the day upon which such subdivision or reclassification becomes effective shall be equitably and proportionately reduced, and conversely, in case outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall each be combined or reclassified into a smaller number of shares of Parent Common Stock, the

  Closing Price Triggers in effect at the close of business on the day upon
which such combination or reclassification becomes effective shall be
equitably and proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as the
case may be, to become effective immediately prior to the opening of business
on the day following the day upon which such subdivision or combination
becomes effective.

 

 (ii) Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, in connection with any such subdivision or reclassification into a greater number of shares of Parent Common Stock, the Escrowed Earnout Shares distributable upon the achievement of the applicable milestones shall be equitably and proportionately increased and, conversely, in connection with any such combination or reclassification into a smaller number of shares of Parent Common Stock, the Escrowed Earnout Shares distributable upon the achievement of the applicable milestones shall be equitably and proportionately reduced. For example, for purposes of clarity, (x) in the case of a 2-for-1 stock split of Parent Common Stock, the Escrowed Earnout Shares distributable upon the achievement of the first milestone shall be increased from 9,666,667 to 19,333,334 and (y) in the case of a 1-for-2 reverse stock split of Parent Common Stock, the Escrowed Earnout Shares distributable upon the achievement of the first milestone shall be reduced from 9,666,667 to 4,833,334 (assuming for the purposes of this example that there are no adjustments to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock in each Tranche). 

 

 (g) Without limiting the specificity of any of the foregoing, it is the intent of the parties to provide for fair and equitable adjustments to the Closing Price Triggers and the Escrowed Earnout Shares to preserve the economic benefits intended to be provided to the Company Stockholders under the terms of this Agreement in the event there is any change in or conversion of the Parent Common Stock and, accordingly, the Parent Board of Directors shall make appropriate equitable adjustments in connection therewith, as determined in the good faith judgment of the Parent Board of Directors. 

 

 (h) Neither Parent, the Company Stockholders nor any Affiliate thereof shall take any action, directly or indirectly, with the intent or effect of influencing or manipulating the market prices of Parent Common Stock during any measurement period described in Sections 2.8(b), (c) and (d) hereof. Furthermore, for the purposes of determining whether a Closing Price Trigger has been achieved for 20 trading days within any 30-trading-day period pursuant to Sections 2.8(b), (c) and (d) hereof, any days during which any such persons (A) have outstanding a public announcement or statement relating to the purchase or sale of equity securities of Parent (other than ordinary-course, generic statements as to the possibility of such purchases from time to time and which do not specify either the amount of any such potential purchases nor the price or prices at which such purchases may be made), whether in the public market or otherwise, or (B) have made, in the aggregate, to the best knowledge of Parent, purchases of Parent Common Stock exceeding 1% of the average daily trading volume reported for the security during the four calendar weeks preceding the week in which such purchases were made, shall not be counted as days on which such Closing Price Trigger has been achieved. Such excluded days shall extend the 30-trading-day measurement period by an equal number of days.

 

 Section 2.9 _Surrender of Certificates_.

  (a) Upon surrender of their Company Certificates at the Closing with a properly completed letter of transmittal (the form of such letter of transmittal to be provided by Parent to the Company for delivery to the Company Stockholders no later than five Business Days prior to Closing (it being understood that such letter of transmittal shall provide that such holders shall acknowledge that they are receiving restricted securities under the federal securities laws and will contain other customary investment representations)), the holders of the Company Common Stock shall receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the Transaction Shares into which their shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted or exchanged at the Effective Time, less the Escrowed Indemnity Shares and Escrowed Earnout Shares, and the Company Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Company Certificates will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the applicable number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.6(c) or, in the case of holders of Appraisal Shares, the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in Section 2.6(h) . 

 

 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Company Certificates with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon surrender thereof until the holders of record of such Company Certificates shall surrender such Company Certificates. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Company Certificates with a properly completed letter of transmittal, Parent shall promptly deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, the certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (not including the Escrowed Indemnity Shares or the shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.8) and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

 Section 2.10 _Indemnity Escrow_. As a remedy for the indemnity set forth in Article VII, at the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent 7.5% of the Transaction Shares (the " _Escrowed Indemnity Shares_ "), comprised of Escrowed Earnout Shares (including First Target Shares, Second Target Shares and Third Target Shares) and Transaction Shares that are not Escrowed Earnout Shares to be held in a separate escrow account and released therefrom (if applicable) from time to time to Parent in satisfaction of such indemnity, all in accordance with Article VII hereof and the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement. On the fifth Business Day following the date (the " _Indemnity Escrow Termination Date_ ") that is fifteen (15) months from the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall release the Escrowed Indemnity Shares, less any of such shares applied in satisfaction of a claim for indemnification and any of such shares related to a claim for indemnification that is then unresolved. Upon such release, Escrowed Indemnity Shares that constitute Transaction Shares shall be delivered to the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 2.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Statement and the Escrow Agreement; and the Escrowed Indemnity Shares that constitute Escrowed Earnout Shares shall be retained in escrow in accordance with Section 2.8 hereof and the Escrow Agreement. Any Escrowed Indemnity Shares held with respect to any unresolved claim for indemnification and not applied as indemnification with respect to such claim upon its resolution shall be delivered in accordance with the preceding sentence.

deemed reasonable to withhold, condition or delay consent to prevent or object
to the disclosure of a fact, circumstance or item that is required to be
disclosed by applicable Law, rule or regulation or by the staff of the SEC
after reasonable consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances).
Parent agrees that the Proxy Statement and the Other Filings will comply in
all material respects with all applicable Laws and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or any Other
Filing, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, will promptly inform the
other party of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its
staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to Parent
Stockholders, such amendment or supplement. The Proxy Statement will be sent
to the Parent Stockholders for the purpose of soliciting proxies from Parent
Stockholders to vote in favor of (i) approval of the Initial Business
Combination contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the issuance and sale of the
Parent Common Stock to the extent that such issuance requires stockholder
approval under the rules of the applicable stock exchange; and (iii) approving

  than reasonable business expenses reimbursable by Parent), incur any
liabilities or bring (or threaten to bring) any Action against a third party
in order to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval. This Section 6.2(d) shall
not be construed to require Parent to be required to make any payment to any
shareholder in exchange for such shareholders vote in favor of the Merger.

the Parent Stockholder Approval, including by participating in customary
investor presentations and road shows.

  Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and

certain contractual disclosure obligations of Parent of which the Company is
aware.

 Section 6.9 _Notices of Certain Events_. From the date hereof through the earlier of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement, the Company will notify Parent, and Parent will notify the Company, of: (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transaction or the Reorganization Actions; and (ii) any Action commenced affecting the Company or Parent, the assets, Liabilities or employees of the Company or Parent, or the consummation of the Transaction. No notice pursuant to this Section will affect any representations or warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements or conditions set forth herein or otherwise affect any available remedies. 

 

 Section 6.10 _Directors  and Officers Insurance_. From and after the Closing Date and until the six year anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall maintain in effect directors and officers liability insurance (or, at Parents option, a "tail" insurance policy) covering those Persons covered by the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Parent as of the date hereof for any actions taken by them or omissions by them on or before the Closing Date with the same directors and officers liability insurance coverage as may be provided from time to time by Parent to its then existing directors and officers; _provided_ that, in no event will Parent be required to expend in the aggregate amounts in any year in excess of 250% of the amount of the last annual premium for such insurance, as set forth on the Parent Disclosure Statement, to cover its then existing directors and officers (in which event, Parent shall purchase the greatest coverage available for such amount). Nothing in this Section 6.10 shall affect the right of any 

  directors or officers that continue their employment with Parent to
participate in any directors and officers liability insurance policy in
effect after the Closing for actions taken after the Closing.

 

 Section 6.11 _Notice of Changes_.

 

 (a) The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, will give prompt notice to the other upon becoming aware of (i) the discovery or occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event or circumstance which causes, or would reasonably be likely to cause, any representation or warranty of such party contained in any Transaction Document to be untrue or inaccurate, or (ii) any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under any Transaction Document on or prior to the Closing Date, where, in the case of (i) and (ii), such discovery, occurrence or failure would, with respect to the Company, permit the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) (disregarding the cure periods therein) or, with respect to Parent, permit Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (disregarding the cure periods therein). No notice pursuant to this Section 6.11(a) will affect any representations or warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or conditions set forth herein or limit or otherwise affect any available remedies. 

 

 (b) Provided that the Company is in material compliance with its covenants and obligations under this Agreement that relate to the subject matter of a Supplemental Disclosure Item, the Company shall have the right to disclose additional matters (a " _Supplemental Disclosure Item_ ") in a letter to Parent (a " _Supplemental Disclosure Statement_ ") delivered not later than ten Business Days prior to the Proxy Statement Date to reflect an action taken following signing and permitted to be taken pursuant to the Companys interim covenants at Sections 6.1(a) and (b); _provided_ , however, that no such Supplemental Disclosure Item shall apply with respect to the representations and warranties at Sections 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.15 and 4.20 hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein: (A) no Supplemental Disclosure Item shall be considered in connection with any exercise by Parent of: (x) its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 or (y) its right not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement because of a failure of the condition set forth in Section 3.2(a) . No Supplemental Disclosure Item shall (i) include any matter (A) arising on or prior to the date hereof which was required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Statement as of the date hereof or (B) arising as a result of a breach of any covenant or agreement contained herein by the Company or Parent; and (ii) be deemed to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of representation or warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of any variance or inaccuracy. The foregoing provisions shall not affect the Companys ability to amend Sections 2.6(c) and 2.6(f) of the Company Disclosure Statement in accordance with Sections 2.6(c) and 2.6(f) hereof, respectively. 

 

 Section 6.12 _Amended and Restated Parent Organizational Documents_. At the Closing, Parent shall (x) amend its Certificate of Incorporation, substantially on terms as set forth in ___Exhibit B_ , with such changes therein as may be approved by Parent and the Company, and (y) amend its Bylaws, substantially on terms as set forth in _Exhibit C_ , with such changes therein as may be approved by Parent and the Company. 

  Section 6.13 _Trust Waiver_. The Company hereby acknowledges that Parent is a recently organized blank check company formed for the purpose of acquiring (an " _Initial_ _Business Combination_ ") one or more businesses or assets. The Company further acknowledges that Parents sole assets consist of the cash proceeds of the recent public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and private placements of its securities, and that substantially all of those proceeds have been deposited in a trust account with a third party (the " _Trust Account_ ") for the benefit of Parent, certain of its stockholders and the underwriters of its IPO. The monies in the Trust Account may be disbursed only (i) to Parent from time to time to cover any tax obligations owed by Parent; (ii) to Parent in limited amounts from time to time (and in no event more than $1,800,000 in total) in order to permit Parent to pay its operating expenses; (iii) to Parent upon completion of an Initial Business Combination; and (iv) if Parent fails to complete an Initial Business Combination within the allotted time period and liquidates, subject to the terms of the agreement governing the Trust Account, to Parents Public Stockholders (as such term is defined in the agreement governing the Trust Account). For and in consideration of Parents agreement to enter into this Agreement, the Company and each of the Company Equityholders hereby waives any right, title, interest or claim of any kind (any " _Claim_ ") it has or may have in the future in or to any monies in the Trust Account and agrees not to seek recourse (whether directly or indirectly) against the Trust Account or any funds distributed therefrom (except amounts released to Parent as described in clause (i) above) as a result of, or arising out of, any Claims against Parent or otherwise arising under this Agreement or otherwise. 

 

 Section 6.14 _No Solicitation._

 

 (a) From the date hereof through the earlier of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement, none of the Company or the Permitted Holders shall authorize or permit any of its or their officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors to, directly or indirectly, (i) furnish any confidential information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, or have discussions with any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, a Company Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) enter into any agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal.

 

 (b) From the date hereof through the earlier of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement, Parent shall not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors to, directly or indirectly, make any Parent Acquisition Proposal, enter into any agreement with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal or have discussions with any third party with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that Parent and its representatives may engage in such discussions with a third party if (A) it is in response to an unsolicited bona fide proposal or offer made by such third party, (B) the Parent Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that such proposal or offer is reasonably likely to be more favorable to Parent and its stockholders than the Transactions and (C) the Parent Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that 

  the failure to engage in such discussions would cause it to violate its
fiduciary duties under Delaware law.

 

 (c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that the provisions of this Section 6.14 were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by the parties hereto that the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Section 6.14 and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, specific performance being the sole remedy with respect to this Section 6.14 if it is available. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restriction set forth above by (A) any officer, director, employee, investment banker, attorney, accountant, consultant or other agent or advisor of the Company or any officer, director, employee or agent acting on behalf of the Permitted Holder shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company and (B) any officer, director, employee, investment banker, attorney, accountant, consultant or other agent or advisor of Parent shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by Parent. 

 

 Section 6.15 _Additional Agreements_. The parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to finalize the Additional Agreements (including the Escrow Agreement) as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof. 

 

 Section 6.16 _Reservation of Parent Shares_. At least 48 hours prior to the Closing, Parent shall reserve a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock, based on a good faith estimate of the Parent Board of Directors after a review of Sections 2.6(c) and (f) of the Company Disclosure Statement, to be available for issuance upon exercise of all of the Converted Options. 

 

 Section 6.17 _Pre-Closing Confirmation and Certification_. Not later than 72 hours prior to the Closing, Parent shall (i) give the trustee of the Trust Account advance notice of the Effective Time, (ii) use best efforts to cause the trustee of the Trust Fund to provide a written confirmation to the Company confirming the dollar amount of the Trust Fund balance held in the Trust Account that will be released to the Surviving Corporation upon consummation of the Merger, and (iii) provide a certificate signed by each of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent in the form of _Exhibit H_ hereto (the " _Working Capital Certificate_ "), which shall set forth the Estimated Working Capital Shortfall, if any. Not later than 72 hours prior to the printing of the Proxy Statement, the Company shall provide a certificate signed by each of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company in the form of _Exhibit I_ hereto (the " _Proceeds Shares Certificate_ "), which shall set forth (A) the Company Equity Sale Proceeds and (B) the Equity Proceeds Shares, in each case, if any. Not later than 48 hours prior to printing the Proxy Statement the Company shall revise Sections 2.6(c) and (f) of the Company Disclosure Statement as necessary to update the list of Company Stockholders and holders of Company Options and to reflect the allocation of the Equity Proceeds Shares, if any, and additional Company Options, if any, and within 48 hours prior to the Closing, the Company shall revise Sections 2.6(c) and (f) of the Company Disclosure Statement as necessary to reflect the final allocation of the Transaction Shares and Converted Options based upon the final Exchange Ratio.

  Section 6.18 _Company Stockholder Representation Letters_. To the extent reasonably required for compliance with the Securities Act, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain from each Company Stockholder as soon as practicable after the date hereof a reasonable and customary investor representations letter (to the extent that Parent has not already received such representations from the Company Stockholder).

Solely for the purposes of determining the amount of any Losses for which Parent may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII, any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that is qualified by a term or terms such as "material," "materially," or "Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed made or given without such qualification and without giving effect to such words. 

 

 Section 7.3 _Indemnification of Third Party Claims_. The indemnification obligations and liabilities under this Article VII with respect to actions, proceedings, lawsuits, investigations, demands or other claims brought by third parties which may give rise to indemnification for Losses hereunder (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

 

 (a) The Surviving Corporation will give the Escrow Representative and the Unaffiliated Directors written notice after receiving written notice of any Third Party Claim or discovering the liability, obligation or facts giving rise to such Third Party Claim (a " _Notice of_ _Claim_ ") which shall set forth, to the extent reasonably knowable (i) a brief description of the nature of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the total amount of actual out-of-pocket Loss or the anticipated potential Loss (including any costs or expenses which have been or may be reasonably incurred in connection therewith), and (iii) whether such Loss may be covered (in whole or in part) under any insurance and the estimated amount of such Loss which may be covered under such insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the Surviving Corporation to give written notice to the Escrow Representative shall not affect the indemnification obligations hereunder.

Any indemnification obligations hereunder shall be settled first by recourse against the 7.5% of Escrowed Indemnity Shares which are not Escrowed Earnout Shares and then by recourse on a pro rata basis against First Target Indemnity Shares, Second Target Indemnity Shares and Third Target Indemnity Shares. 

 

 (b) The value of each Escrowed Indemnity Share (including the First Target Indemnity Shares, Second Target Indemnity Shares and Third Target Indemnity Shares) for purposes of making payments to the Surviving Corporation or any of the Parent Indemnitees on account of Losses in accordance with the provisions of this Article VII shall be deemed to be the Closing Price of Parent Common Stock on the date of payment to a Parent Indemnitee.

 

 (c) Except in the case of fraud, willful misrepresentation, or intentional breach, the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties after the Closing for damages with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party agrees that the other party, its agents and representatives (each of whom shall be third party beneficiaries of this provision) shall have no liability to the first party except as set forth in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and except to the extent of such other partys, such agents or such representatives fraud, willful misrepresentation or intentional breach.

Upon the appointment of a successor Escrow Representative under this Agreement, such successor Escrow Representative will succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the predecessor Escrow Representative under this Agreement, and the predecessor Escrow Representative will be discharged from such predecessor Escrow Representatives duties and obligations under this Agreement.
