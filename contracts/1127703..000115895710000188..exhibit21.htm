AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement"), dated as of August 31,
2010, by and among PROASSURANCE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("PRA"),
CA BRIDGE CORPORATION, a Texas corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
PRA ("NEWCO"), and AMERICAN PHYSICIANS SERVICE GROUP, INC., a Texas
corporation ("APS").

 

WITNESSETH:

 

WHEREAS, PRA is an insurance holding company which provides, through its
insurance subsidiaries, medical professional liability insurance; and

 

WHEREAS, APS is an insurance holding company which provides, through its
subsidiaries, medical professional liability insurance (the "Business"); and

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors of PRA, NEWCO and APS have determined that it
is in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders for
PRA to acquire APS through the consummation of the business combination
transaction provided for in this Agreement.

 

NOW,

 

THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound by this Agreement, the parties to this Agreement agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE 1 
 THE MERGER

 

1.1

 

 _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the Texas Business Organizations Code, as amended (the
"TBOC"), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 of this Agreement),
NEWCO shall merge with and into APS (the "Merger"). APS shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Texas. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of NEWCO shall terminate. APS, as
the surviving corporation after the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as
the "Surviving Corporation."

 

1.2

 

 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and in
connection with the Closing (as defined in Section 9.1 of this Agreement), a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") will be filed with the
Secretary of State of Texas pursuant to Section 10.153 of the TBOC. The
parties will make all other filings or recordings as may be required under the
TBOC, and the Merger will become effective when the Certificate of Merger is
filed in the office of the Secretary of State of Texas, or at such later date
or time as NEWCO and APS agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the
time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

 

1.3

 

 _Effects of Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have
the effects set forth in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
TBOC. At the Effective Time, (i) all rights, franchises, licenses and
interests of NEWCO in and to every type of property, real, personal and mixed,
and all choses in action of NEWCO shall continue unaffected and uninterrupted
by the Merger and shall accrue to the Surviving Corporation; (ii) all rights,
franchises, licenses and interests of APS in and to every type of property,
real, personal and mixed, and all choses in action of APS shall continue
unaffected and uninterrupted by the Merger and shall accrue to the Surviving
Corporation; (iii) all obligations and liabilities of APS then outstanding
shall remain obligations of APS, as the Surviving Corporation; (iv) all
obligations and liabilities of NEWCO then outstanding shall become and be
obligations of the Surviving Corporation; and (v) no action or proceeding then
pending and to which the APS or NEWCO is a party shall be abated or
discontinued but may be prosecuted to final judgment by the Surviving
Corporation.

 


  

 



  1.4

 

 _Conversion of NEWCO Shares_. At the Effective Time, each of the shares of
NEWCO common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "NEWCO Common Stock"),
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall convert into one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $0.10 per share
(the "Surviving Corporation Common Stock"). It is the intention of the
parties that, immediately after the Effective Time, PRA shall own all of the
issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

 

1.5

 

 _Conversion of APS Capital Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the following exchange shall occur at the Effective Time:

 

(a)

 

Without any action on the part of any holder of record of the shares of common
stock, each share of common stock of APS, par value $0.10 per share (the "APS
Common Stock") shall be converted into the right to receive payment of cash to
each holder of APS Common Stock in an amount equal to $32.50 per share of APS
Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration"). Each holder of APS Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of APS at and after the
Effective Time, except the right to receive the Stock Consideration. 

 

(b)

 

Each share of APS Common Stock that is owned by APS or any APS Subsidiary (as
defined in Section 3.2(a) of this Agreement) shall automatically be cancelled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no Stock Consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefore.

 

1.6

 

 _Stock Options and Deferred Compensation Plan._

 

(a)

 

Section 1.6(a) of the APS Disclosure Schedule (as defined in Article 3 of this
Agreement) lists any unexpired and unexercised options or similar rights to
purchase APS Common Stock (the "APS Stock Options") issued by APS pursuant to
the 2005 Amended and Restated Incentive and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan
(the "APS Option Plan"). Section 1.6(a) of the APS Disclosure Schedule also
sets forth, with respect to each APS Stock Option, as applicable, the option
exercise price, the number of shares subject to the APS Stock Option, the date
granted, the vesting date, and the expiration date of the APS Stock Option and
indicates whether the APS Stock Option is an incentive or a nonqualified stock
option and any other information relating to the liabilities or amount owed
under the APS Stock Options. 

 

(b)

 

Section 1.6(b) of the APS Disclosure Schedule lists each share of APS Common
Stock (the "APS Deferred Stock") issued and held under, or to be issued
pursuant to, the American Physicians Service Group, Inc. Affiliated Group
Deferred Compensation Master Plan, as amended (the "APS Deferred Compensation
Plan" and together with the APS Option Plan, the "APS Stock Plans").

 

(c)

 

Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of APS (or if appropriate,
any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other
actions necessary and appropriate to provide in accordance with the terms of
the applicable APS Stock Plans that, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders of any options or other stock-based awards,
(i) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each participant in any of the
APS Stock Plans shall fully and immediately vest in any options or other stock
or stock-based awards awarded under such APS Stock Plans and (ii) at the
Effective Time: (A) the APS Stock Plans shall be cancelled; (B) all
outstanding APS Stock Options shall be cancelled in consideration for the
Option Consideration to be paid pursuant to Section 1.6(d) hereof; and (C) all
outstanding APS Deferred Stock shall be cancelled in consideration for the
payment of the Deferred Compensation Consideration under Section 1.6(e)
hereof.

 

(d)

 

As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, each APS Stock Option shall be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (i) the total number of shares
of APS Common Stock previously subject to such APS Stock Option multiplied by
(ii) the amount by which $32.50 exceeds the exercise price per share of APS
Common Stock previously subject to such APS Stock Option (such amounts payable
hereunder being referred to as the "Option Consideration"). From and after
the Effective Time, any APS Stock Option converted pursuant to this Section
1.6 shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall
only entitle such holder to the payment of the Option Consideration.

 


  

 

2

  (e)

 

As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each share of APS Deferred Stock held in the
APS Deferred Compensation Plan shall be converted into the right to receive
payment of cash in an amount equal to $32.50 per share of APS Deferred Stock
(the "Deferred Compensation Consideration").

 

(f)

 

To the extent then in effect, after the Effective Time, all APS Stock Plans
shall be terminated and no further APS Stock Options, APS Deferred Stock, or
other awards shall be granted under the APS Stock Plans.

 

1.7

 

 _401(k) Plan._

 

(a)

 

Section 1.7(a) of the APS Disclosure Schedule lists each unvested share of APS
Common Stock held for the account of a participant (together with each vested
share of APS Common Stock, the "401(k) Match Shares") under the APS 401(k)
Profit Sharing Plan (the "401(k) Plan") and reflects the vesting schedule for
such shares.

 

(b)

 

Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of APS (or if appropriate,
any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other
actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, in accordance with the terms of the 401(k) Plan, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any 401(k) Plan participant,
each participant in the 401(k) Plan shall fully and immediately vest in any
unvested 401(k) Match Shares contributed on behalf of such participant under
the 401(k) Plan.

 

(c)

 

The Stock Consideration deliverable with respect to the shares of APS Common
Stock that are 401(k) Match Shares (the "401(k) Consideration") shall be
distributed to the trustee of the 401(k) Plan and shall be held and allocated
thereunder in accordance with the terms of the 401(k) Plan, which plan shall
not be terminated other than in accordance with its terms.

 

1.8

 

 _Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation_. Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Articles of
Incorporation of APS then in effect shall be, and shall continue in effect as,
the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until amended in
accordance with applicable law. 

 

1.9

 

 _Bylaws of Surviving Corporation_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of NEWCO then in effect
shall be, and shall continue in effect as, the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, until amended in accordance with applicable law.

 

1.10

 

 _Management and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time,
the directors and officers of NEWCO shall be and become the board of directors
and officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their successors are elected
and qualified.

 

1.11

 

 _PRA Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share of PRA
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior thereto shall remain an
issued and outstanding share of common stock of PRA and shall not be affected
by the Merger.

 

1.12

 

 _Management and Officers of API Insurance_. At the Effective Time, each of
the directors and officers of API Insurance shall resign from its board of
directors or as an officer, as the case may be, and the Surviving Corporation
shall as the sole shareholder of API Insurance elect new directors to serve on
the board of directors of API Insurance. 

 


  

 

3

  ARTICLE 2 
 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

2.1

 

 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, PRA shall appoint American
Transfer Company, or a bank or trust company acceptable to APS, to act as an
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent"). The Exchange Agent shall effect the
plan of exchange as herein provided. PRA shall pay the charges and expenses
of the Exchange Agent.

 

2.2

 

 _Exchange Procedures. _

 

(a)

 

Prior to the Effective Time, PRA shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (the
"Exchange Fund") cash in an amount equal to the sum of the Stock
Consideration, Option Consideration, Deferred Compensation Consideration and
401(k) Consideration (collectively the "Merger Consideration") and promptly
after the Effective Time, but no later than two (2) business days following
the Effective Time, APS shall deposit with the Exchange Agent a list of the
names and addresses of each Person (as defined in Section 9.17(a) of this
Agreement) who was a record holder of APS Common Stock, APS Stock Options, APS
Deferred Stock and 401(k) Match Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
or who is otherwise entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (collectively
the "Merger Consideration Recipients") and the amount of the cash payment to
which each of the Merger Consideration Recipients is entitled under the plan
of exchange as herein provided.

 

(b)

 

Promptly after the Effective Time, but no later than two (2) business days
following the Effective Time, PRA will cause the Exchange Agent to send to
each Person who was a record holder of APS Common Stock immediately before the
Effective Time transmittal materials for exchanging the certificates
representing APS Common Stock (the "Old Certificates") for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of the Old Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with the duly executed transmittal materials, and
such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require (or, if such
shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry
through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a book-
entry account statement (it being understood that any references herein to
"certificates" shall be deemed to include references to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of APS Common Stock)), the
holder of such Old Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive
in respect of the Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 2.2 (after taking into account all shares of APS Common Stock
then held by such holder), and the Old Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Neither PRA nor APS, as the surviving corporation,
shall be obligated to deliver the Merger Consideration to which any former
record holder of APS Common Stock is entitled as a result of the Merger until
such record holder surrenders his or her certificate or certificates
representing the shares of APS Common Stock for exchange as provided in this
Section 2.2.

 

(c)

 

The Exchange Agent shall pay the Option Consideration to APS promptly after
the Effective Time but in no event more than two (2) business days after the
Effective Time for distribution to the holders of APS Stock Options. APS shall
promptly pay the Option Consideration to each holder of an APS Stock Option in
accordance with the requirements of the APS Option Plan for the cancellation
of the outstanding APS Stock Options. APS shall withhold all payroll taxes
required to be paid for the account of the holders of the APS Stock Options.

 

(d)

 

The Exchange Agent shall pay the Deferred Compensation Consideration to APS
promptly after the Effective Time but in no event more than two (2) business
days after the Effective Time, for distribution to the holders of APS Deferred
Stock in accordance with the Deferred Compensation Plan. APS shall promptly
pay the Deferred Compensation Consideration to each holder of APS Deferred
Stock in accordance with the requirements of the APS Deferred Compensation
Plan for the cancellation of the outstanding APS Deferred Stock. APS shall
withhold all payroll taxes required to be paid for the account of the holders
of the APS Deferred Stock. 

 

(e)

 

The Exchange Agent shall pay the 401(k) Consideration to the trustee for the
401(k) Plan or such other party that such trustee shall direct, promptly after
the Effective Time but in no event more than two (2) business days after the
Effective Time, for allocation to the 401(k) Consideration Recipients in
accordance with this Agreement. 

 


  

 

4

  (f)

 

Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, neither PRA nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Merger Consideration Recipient for any
amounts paid or property delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property law.

 

(g)

 

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of APS shall be closed as to
holders of APS Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and no
transfer of APS Common Stock by any such record holder shall thereafter be
made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.2, each certificate theretofore representing
shares of APS Common Stock shall from and after the Effective Time represent
for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to which
such holder is entitled provided in this Agreement in exchange therefor.

 

2.3

 

 _Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the Merger Consideration Recipient for twelve (12) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to PRA, upon demand, and any
Merger Consideration Recipient who has not theretofore complied with this
Agreement shall thereafter look only to PRA for payment of their claim for
distributions with respect to the Merger Consideration.

 

2.4

 

 _Withholding_. 

 

PRA or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated thereby to any Merger Consideration Recipient such amounts as PRA
or the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To
the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by PRA or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Merger Consideration Recipient in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding were made by PRA or the Exchange Agent. 

 

2.5

 

 _Dissenting Shareholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, each share of APS Common Stock that is held by Persons who
reject the amount of the Stock Consideration and fully comply with the
provisions of Sections 10.351-10.368 of the TBOC (the "Dissenter Provisions")
shall not be exchanged for the Stock Consideration. Instead, (a) the holders
of such shares (the "Dissenting Shares"), upon compliance with and subject to
the requirements of the Dissenter Provisions, shall be entitled to payment of
the appraised fair value of such shares in accordance with the Dissenter
Provisions, accompanied with the items as set forth in Section 10.356 of the
TBOC; (b) each of the Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and extinguished;
and (c) if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall subsequently withdraw his
demand for payment of the appraised fair value of such shares in accordance
with the Dissenter Provisions, such holder shall forfeit the right to payment
of the appraised fair value of such shares and such shares shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into the Stock Consideration.

 

2.6

 

 _Lost or Stolen Certificates_. If any holder of APS Common Stock is unable
to deliver the Old Certificate which represents such shares of APS Common
Stock, the Exchange Agent, in the absence of actual notice that any such
shares have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, shall deliver to such
holder the Merger Consideration to which the holder of APS Common Stock is
entitled for such shares upon presentation of the following: (i) evidence to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent and PRA that any such
certificate has been lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed; (ii) such security
or indemnity as may be reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent or PRA to

 _Corporate Organization._ APS is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Texas. APS has
the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not
have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.17(a) of this
Agreement) on APS.

 

3.2

 

 _Subsidiaries_.

 

(a)

 

Section 3.2(a) of the APS Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name and state of

organized and validly existing as a corporation under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and in
good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign)
where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business

material respects. All of its licenses and registrations are in full force
and effect and there is no proceeding or investigation pending or, to the
Knowledge (as defined in Section 9.17(a) of this Agreement) of APS, threatened

licensed to offer such products. The business of each APS Agency has been and
is being conducted in compliance with all of its licenses in all material
respects. All of such licenses are in full force and effect and there is no
proceeding or investigation pending, or, to the Knowledge of APS, threatened
which would reasonably be expected to lead to the revocation, amendment,

equity ownership interests of any of the APS Subsidiaries except shares or

interests or options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire any additional
shares of its capital stock, partnership interests or other equity ownership
interests or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or

(b)

 

APS has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such

controls and procedures: (i) are designed to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed in APSs reports that it files or submits under the

periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to APSs management, including its Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required financial disclosure, (ii) have been evaluated

weaknesses in the design or operation of the internal controls over financial
reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) of
APS and the APS Subsidiaries which could adversely affect APSs ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data, and (y) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a role in the internal controls over financial reporting of APS and the APS
Subsidiaries. Since the date of the most recent evaluation of such internal
controls over financial reporting and procedures, there have been no
significant changes in internal controls over financial reporting or in other
factors that could significantly affect such internal controls over financial
reporting, including any corrective actions with regard to significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses.

 

(c)

 

The financial statements of APS and the APS Subsidiaries included in the APS
SEC Reports (including the related notes) (the "APS GAAP Financial

requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto (including, without limitation, Regulation S-X), (ii) were or will be
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements,
to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods and at the dates involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and (iii) did or will
fairly present the consolidated financial condition of APS and the APS
Subsidiaries at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations
and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments that were not, or
with respect to any such financial statements contained in any APS SEC Reports
to be filed subsequent to the date hereof are not reasonably expected to be,
material in amount or effect). Except (x) as reflected in APSs audited
balance sheet at December 31, 2009 (the "2009 APS Balance Sheet"), or
liabilities described in any notes thereto (or liabilities for which neither
accrual nor footnote disclosure is required pursuant to GAAP), or (y) for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 31,
2009 consistent with past practice or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary has any
material liabilities or obligations of any nature.

forms, reports and documents required to be filed by the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA"), and the applicable Securities Regulators
(as defined in Section 9.17(a) of this Agreement) under the Securities Laws

Disclosure Schedule lists, and APS has delivered to PRA true and complete
copies in the form filed with the SEC, FINRA or other Securities Regulators of
(i) Form BD of APS Financial and all amendments thereto; (ii) any Form BR

for each fiscal year of APS Financial commencing after December 31, 2006; (iv)
all applicable Uniform Registration Forms (Forms U-4 and U-5) filed by APS
Financial with FINRA and any Securities Regulator, with respect to employees
and independent contractors of APS Financial as of June 30, 2010; and (v) all
forms, reports and other documents filed with FINRA or a Securities Regulator
since January 1, 2007, including without limitation CRD reports filed pursuant
to NASD Rule 3070 (the "APS Financial Reports"). The APS Financial Reports
were in compliance with the Securities Laws and the FINRA requirements when
filed and the disclosure set forth in the APS Financial Reports as amended and
updated does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. No deficiencies have been asserted in writing or to
APSs Knowledge, orally by any Securities Regulator or FINRA with respect to
APS Financials operations, registrations or filings that have not been
satisfied.

At all times prior to the cessation of its business, APS Financial was a fully
disclosed introducing broker-dealer and was not required at any time to
maintain records in accordance with Rule 17a-3 and Rule 17a-4 of the SEC by
reason of the exemption provided by Rule 15c3-3(k)(2)(ii) of the SEC. During
such period APS Financial engaged a clearing broker that was registered as a
broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and was a member of FINRA and the
Securities Investor Protection Corporation that assumed responsibility for
maintaining records and for the custody of securities of customers of APS
Financial. To the Knowledge of APS, there have been no defaults under such
agreement with the clearing broker, and no complaints or notices have been
received from customers relating to failure to provide reports or custody of
securities.

Management, Inc. ("APS Adviser"), a former APS Subsidiary, as of August 6,

material claim for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duties under ERISA,
bad faith, breach of warranty, tort, negligence, infringement, fraud,
discrimination, wrongful discharge of any nature is currently asserted or, to

there, to APSs Knowledge any basis for any such future claim. 

 

(d)

 

As to each matter (if any) described on Section 3.12(a) and 3.12(b) of the APS
Disclosure Schedule, accurate and complete copies of all relevant pleadings,

3.13

 

 _Insurance._

 

(a)

 

Except as set forth in Section 3.13(a) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, APS and
the APS Subsidiaries maintain policies of general liability, fire and
casualty, automobile, directors and officers, errors and omissions, fiduciary,
and other forms of insurance (the "APS Insurance Policies") in such amounts,
with such deductibles and against such risks and losses which management
believes are reasonable for the business and assets of APS and the APS
Subsidiaries. All such policies are in full force and effect, all premiums
due and payable thereon have been paid (other than retroactive or
retrospective premium adjustments that are not yet, but may be, required to be
paid with respect to any period ending prior to the Closing Date under
comprehensive general liability and workmens compensation insurance
policies), and no written notice of cancellation or termination has been
received with respect to any such policy which has not been replaced on
substantially similar terms prior to the date of such cancellation. To the
Knowledge of APS, the activities and operations of APS and the APS
Subsidiaries have been conducted in a manner so as to conform in all material
respects to all applicable provisions of such insurance policies. 

 


  

 

14

  (b)

 

Except as set forth in Section 3.13(a) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, no
issuer of the APS Insurance Policies has issued a reservation-of-rights
letter, or entered into a nonwaiver agreement, or otherwise denied or limited
coverage (in whole or in part), under any of the APS Insurance Policies, and,
to the Knowledge of APS, no declaratory judgment has been sought by any Person
or entered by any court of competent jurisdiction that denies or limits
coverage (in whole or in part) under any of the APS Insurance Policies.

 

3.14

 

 _Taxes and Tax Returns._

 

(a)

 

As used in this Agreement: "Tax" or "Taxes" means all federal, state, county,
local, and foreign income, excise, gross receipts, gross income, profits,
franchise, license, ad valorem, profits, gains, capital, sales, transfer, use,
payroll, employment, severance, withholding, duties, intangibles, franchise,
backup withholding, stamp, occupation, premium, social security (or similar),
unemployment, disability, real property, personal property, sales, use,
registration, alternative or add on minimum, estimated, and other taxes, tax
charges, tax levies or like tax assessments together with all penalties and
additions to tax and interest thereon). "Tax Return" or "Tax Returns" means
any and all returns, declarations, claims for refunds, reports, information
returns and information statements (including, without limitation, Form 1099,
Form W-2 and W-3, Form 5500, and Form 990) with respect to Taxes filed, or
required to be filed, by any Person or any Subsidiary of such Person with the
Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or any other tax authority or tax agency,
whether domestic or foreign (including consolidated, combined and unitary tax
returns).

 

(b)

 

APS and the APS Subsidiaries have duly filed all Tax Returns required to be
filed by them on or prior to the date of this Agreement (all such Tax Returns
being accurate and complete in all material respects) and has duly paid or
made sufficient provisions for the payment of all Taxes shown thereon as owing
on or prior to the date of this Agreement (including, if and to the extent
applicable, those due in respect of their properties, income, business,
capital stock, premiums, franchises, licenses, sales and payrolls) other than
Taxes which are not yet delinquent or are being contested in good faith and
have not been finally determined for which adequate reserves have been made in
the APS GAAP Financial Statements. Neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary has
waived any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to a Tax Return or tax assessment or deficiency
other than extensions that are automatically granted by the taxing authorities
upon filing an application therefore. The unpaid Taxes of APS and the APS
Subsidiaries do not exceed the reserve for tax liability set forth on the 2009
APS Balance Sheet as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date
in accordance with past custom and practice of APS in filing its returns. No
claim has been made since December 31, 2005 by an authority in a jurisdiction
where APS or any APS Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. 

 

(c)

 

There is no claim, audit, action, suit, proceeding or investigation now
pending or, to the Knowledge of APS, threatened against or with respect to APS
or any APS Subsidiary in respect of any material Tax. APS and each APS
Subsidiary in connection with amounts paid or owed to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party have
complied with applicable tax withholding in all material respects. APS and
each APS Subsidiary have reported such withheld amounts to the appropriate
taxing authority and to each such employee, independent contractor, creditor,
shareholder or other third party as required by applicable law.

 


  

 

15

  (d)

 

There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of APS or APS Subsidiary
except Liens for current Taxes not yet due. Neither APS nor any APS
Subsidiary has been required to include in income any adjustment pursuant to
Section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") by
reason of a voluntary change in accounting method initiated by APS or any APS
Subsidiary, and the IRS has not initiated or proposed any such adjustment or
change in accounting method. Except as set forth in the APS GAAP Financial
Statements, neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary has entered into a transaction
which is being accounted for as an installment obligation under Section 453 of
the Code. Neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any
tax indemnity, tax sharing or tax allocation agreement (other than such
agreements as exist by and among themselves). Neither APS nor any APS
Subsidiary has ever been a member of an affiliated group of corporations
within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code other than as a common parent
corporation. Neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary is liable for the Taxes of
any Person under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law) or by contract, as a successor
or otherwise. During the five (5) year period ending on the date hereof,
neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary was a distributing corporation or a
controlled corporation in a transaction intended to be governed by Section 355
of the Code. Neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary is a party to any joint
venture, partnership or other arrangement or contract that could be treated as
a partnership for federal income tax purposes. APSs basis and excess loss
account, if any, in each APS Subsidiary is set forth in Section 3.14(d) of the
APS Disclosure Schedule.

 

(e)

 

Except as set forth in Section 3.14(e) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, there
has been no disallowance of a deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code for
employee remuneration of any amount paid or payable by APS or any APS
Subsidiary under any contract, plan, program, arrangement or understanding.

 

(f)

 

There is no dispute or claim concerning any tax liability of APS or any APS
Subsidiary except as disclosed in Section 3.14(f) of the APS Disclosure
Schedule. Section 3.14(f) of the APS Disclosure Schedule identifies the last
Tax Returns that have been audited by the taxing authority with whom they were
filed, and indicates those Tax Returns that currently are the subject of an
audit procedure or that APS or any APS Subsidiary has received notice will be
subject to an audit procedure. APS has made available to PRA correct and
complete copies of all federal income tax returns (including amendments
thereto) of, all examination reports of, and statements of deficiencies
assessed against or agreed to by, APS or any APS Subsidiary for any tax year
commencing after December 31, 2006.

 

(g)

 

Except as set forth in Section 3.14(g) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, APS
and/or any APS Subsidiary will not have any taxable income or gain as a result
of prior inter-company transactions that will be taken into account as a
result of the changes in ownership contemplated herein.

 

3.15

 

 _Employee Plans; Labor Matters._

 

(a)

 

Section 3.15(a) of the APS Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of all of the Employee Plans (as defined in Section 9.17(a) of this
Agreement) for employees of APS and any APS Subsidiary ("APS Employee Plans").
Those APS Employee Plans which cover only employees of APS or an APS
Subsidiary are separately identified. Those APS Employee Plans which are non-
qualified deferred compensation plans for purposes of Section 409A of the Code
are separately identified. Except with respect to the APS Employee Plans,
neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary sponsors, maintains or contributes to, or
has any ongoing obligation or liability whatsoever with respect to: (i) any
employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or (ii) any other program,
plan, trust agreement or arrangement for any bonus, severance,
hospitalization, vacation, sick pay, deferred compensation, pension, profit
sharing, post-employment, retirement, payroll savings, stock option, stock
purchase, group insurance, self insurance, death benefit, fringe benefit,
welfare or any other employee benefit plan or fringe benefit arrangement of
any nature whatsoever including those for the benefit of former employees.
Neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary has any agreement, arrangement, commitment,
or understanding, whether legally binding or not, to create any additional APS
Employee Plan or to continue, modify, change, or terminate, in any material
respect, any APS Employee Plan. PRA may modify, amend and/or terminate any
APS Employee Plan after the Effective Time, subject to applicable law and the
terms of such APS Employee Plan.

 


  

 

16

  (b)

 

APS has heretofore delivered or made available to PRA true and complete copies
of each APS Employee Plan and certain related documents, including: (i) the
plan document and the related trust agreement or annuity contract for such APS
Employee Plan; (ii) the summary plan description, summaries of material
modifications and any other material employee communication document for such
APS Employee Plan; (iii) the actuarial report for such APS Employee Plan (if
applicable) for each of the last two years; (iv) all determination letters
from the IRS (if applicable) for such APS Employee Plan; (v) all insurance
policies relating thereto and any written materials used by APS to describe
employee benefits to employees of APS and the APS Subsidiaries; (vi) the most
recent annual return on Form 5500 (including all schedules thereto along with
the accompanying auditors opinion, if applicable) and tax return (Form 990)
for such APS Employee Plan; (vii) the most current actuarial, valuation, and
trustees reports (as applicable) for such APS Employee Plan; and (viii) all
material communications with any governmental entity or agency (including the
Department of Labor, the IRS, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and
the SEC) with respect to such APS Employee Plan. Each such actuarial or
valuation report correctly shows the value of the assets of such APS Employee
Plan as of the date thereof, the total accrued and vested liabilities, all
contributions by APS and the APS Subsidiaries, and the assumptions on which
the calculations are based.

 

(c)

 

Except as set forth in Section 3.15(c) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, each of
the APS Employee Plans has been operated and administered in all material
respects in compliance with its terms and applicable laws and regulations,
including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code. To the Knowledge of APS,
there has not been any material violation of the reporting and disclosure
provisions of the Code and ERISA. Except as set forth in Section 3.15(c) of
the APS Disclosure Schedule, the Employee Plans which are nonqualified
deferred compensation plans for purposes of Section 409A of the Code are in
compliance in all material respects with the requirements of Section 409A and
the regulations promulgated thereunder. There has not been any termination or
partial termination (including any termination or partial termination
attributable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) of such
plans. Neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary nor any of their respective ERISA
affiliates, nor any predecessor thereof, contributes to, or has within the
past six years contributed to, any multiemployer plans, as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA, or any multiple employer welfare arrangements, as defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA. Neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary nor any of their
respective ERISA affiliates, nor any predecessor thereof, sponsors,
participates in, or contributes to, or has at any time in the past sponsored,
participated in, or contributed to (i) any plan which is subject to the
funding standards or requirements described in Section 412 of the Code, or
(ii) any plan which is subject to any of the requirements, obligations, and
liabilities imposed by Title IV of ERISA.

 

(d)

 

Each APS Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code is so qualified and has received a favorable determination letter
or has pending or has time remaining in which to file, an application for such
determination from the IRS or is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion
letter from the IRS issued to a prototype plan sponsor with respect to a form
of prototype plan adopted by APS, and APS is not aware of any reason why any
such determination letter should be revoked or not be reissued, and any
related trust is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code. APS
has made available to PRA copies of the most recent IRS determination letters
and applications for determination letters with respect to each such APS
Employee Plan (if applicable). No prohibited transaction within the meaning
of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or breach of fiduciary
duty under Title I of ERISA has occurred with respect to any APS Employee Plan
or with respect to APS or any APS Subsidiary. No events have occurred with
respect to any APS Employee Plan that could result in payment or assessment by
or against APS or any APS Subsidiaries of any material excise taxes under
Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the
Code.

 

(e)

 

There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by APS or any APS Subsidiary relating to, or change
in employee participation or coverage under, any APS Employee Plan which would
increase materially the expense of maintaining APS Employee Plans above the
level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2009. No event has occurred or circumstances exist that could
result in a material increase in the premium costs of APS Employee Plans that
are insured, or a material increase in benefit costs of the APS Employee Plans
that are self-insured.

 


  

 

17

  (f)

 

Except as set forth in Section 3.15(f) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, there
is no action, suit, investigation, audit or proceeding pending against or
involving or, to the Knowledge of APS, threatened against or involving any APS
Employee Plan before any court or arbitrator or any state, federal or local
governmental body, agency or official, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
APS. Other than claims for benefits submitted by participants or
beneficiaries, no claim against, or legal proceeding involving, any APS
Employee Plan is pending or threatened.

 

(g)

 

Except as described in Section 3.15(g) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (i) result in any material
payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute or
otherwise) becoming due to any director or employee of APS or any APS
Subsidiary from APS or any APS Subsidiary under any APS Employee Plan or
otherwise; (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
APS Employee Plan; (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefits to any material extent (in each case under
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) whether or not such payment or benefit would
constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code); (iv) constitute an acceleration of the payment or vesting of deferred
compensation in violation of the requirements of Section 409A of the Code; or
(v) constitute a prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or breach of fiduciary duty under Title I
of ERISA.

 

(h)

 

Neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary has any direct or indirect material
liability or obligation under any APS Employee Plan other than as described in
the terms of such APS Employee Plans. There are no circumstances arising out
of the sponsorship of any APS Employee Plan which will result in any direct or
indirect material liability to APS or any APS Subsidiary, other than liability
for contributions, benefit payments, administrative costs and liabilities
incurred in accordance with the terms of the APS Employee Plans consistent
with past practice.

 

(i)

 

Except as set forth in Section 3.15(i) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, APS and
each APS Subsidiary have made all payments and contributions due from them to
each APS Employee Plan. There are no funded benefit obligations under any APS
Employee Plan for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued,
and there are no unfunded benefit obligations that have not been accounted for
by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP on the
financial statements of APS and each APS Subsidiary.

 

(j)

 

Each APS Employee Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA that is not qualified under Section 401(a) or
403(a) of the Code is exempt from Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title I of ERISA as an
unfunded plan that is maintained primarily for the purpose of providing
deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees, pursuant to Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA and
APS has filed a "top hat" registration letter with the Department of Labor for
each such plan. Except as set forth in Section 3.15(j) of the APS Disclosure
Schedule, no assets of APS or any APS Subsidiary are allocated to or held in a
"rabbi trust" or similar funding vehicle. 

 

(k)

 

Each APS Employee Plan that is a "group health plan" (as defined in Section
607(1) of ERISA or Section 5001(b)(1) of the Code) has been operated at all
times in compliance in all material respects with the provisions of Section
4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA"), with
the provisions of the Code and ERISA enacted by the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), and with the provisions
of any applicable similar state law. 

 

(l)

 

Except as set forth in Section 3.15(l) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, APS
does not provide and is not obligated to provide welfare benefits to current
or former employees beyond their retirement or other termination of service
(other than coverage mandated by COBRA).

 

(m)

 

Neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary has the obligation to maintain, establish,
sponsor, participate in, or contribute to any Employee Plan for the benefit of
any employee, former employee, director or consultant of either APS or any APS
Subsidiary or any ERISA affiliate who performs services outside of the United
States.

during the past five (5) years.

 

(c)

in all material respects permitted and authorized by applicable zoning laws,
ordinances and regulations.

 

(b)

 

To the Knowledge of APS, APS and the APS Subsidiaries enjoy peaceful and
undisturbed possession under all APS Real Property Leases. APS has made
available to PRA complete and correct copies of all of the APS Real Property

creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies). To the

defaults by APS or any APS Subsidiary, or any other party, under any APS Real
Property Lease. To the Knowledge of APS, neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary

under any APS Real Property Lease. To the Knowledge of APS, except as set
forth in Section 3.5(b) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, no condition or event
has occurred which with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both
would constitute a default or breach by APS or any APS Subsidiary, or any

security deposits, reserve funds, and other sums and charges that have become
due and payable under the APS Real Property Leases have been paid in full. To
the Knowledge of APS, there are no purchase contracts, options or other
agreements of any kind whereby any Person has acquired or will have any basis

property subject to the APS Real Property Leases.

 

(c)

(d)

 

Neither APS nor any APS Subsidiary has received any written notice of any
violations of any Environmental Laws regarding property subject to the APS

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and taken such action such that
the provisions of the TBOC and any other provisions of any state or local
"takeover" law applicable to APS will not apply to this Agreement or any of

acknowledges that the Insurance Laws applicable to APS regulate and apply to
the change in the ownership of APS as contemplated by this Agreement.

 


  

 

24

  3.23

 

 _Insurance Matters._

 

(a)

 

Except as set forth in Section 3.23(a) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, all
policies, binders, slips, certificates and other agreements of insurance in
effect as of the date hereof (including all applications, endorsements,
supplements, endorsements, riders and ancillary agreements in connection
therewith) issued by the APS Insurance Subsidiaries, and any and all marketing
materials, agent agreements, broker agreements, service contracts, and
managing general agents agreements to which APS or any APS Subsidiary is a
party, are, to the extent required under applicable law, on forms approved by
the Insurance Regulators or have been filed with and to the Knowledge of APS,
not objected to by such Insurance Regulators within the period provided for
objection, and all of such forms comply with the Insurance Laws in all
material respects. As to premium rates established by API Insurance which are
required to be filed with or approved by any Insurance Regulators, the rates
have been so filed or approved, the premiums charged conform thereto, and such
premiums comply with the Insurance Laws. Section 3.23(a) of the APS
Disclosure Schedule sets forth all increases in premium rates for medical
professional liability insurance submitted by the API Insurance which have
been disapproved by any Insurance Regulators since December 31, 2009. Section
3.23(a) of the APS Disclosure Schedule lists all correspondence or other
written communications from any Insurance Regulator received by APS or API
Insurance after December 31, 2009, that requests or suggests that its premium
rates, if applicable, for professional liability insurance should be reduced
below the current approved premium levels.

 

(b)

 

Except as set forth in Section 3.23(b) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, API
Insurance has not issued any participating policies or any retrospectively
rated policies of insurance with respect to which potential payments exist.

 

(c)

 

All reinsurance treaties or agreements entered into on or after January 1,
2000, including retrocessional agreements, to which API Insurance is a party
or under which API Insurance has any existing rights, obligations or
liabilities are listed on Section 3.23(c) of the APS Disclosure Schedule (the
"APS Reinsurance Treaties"). APS has provided PRA with correct and complete
copies of all of such APS Reinsurance Treaties and all such APS Reinsurance
Treaties are in full force and effect, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in the termination
of any APS Reinsurance Treaties. The APS SAP Statements accurately reflect
the extent to which, pursuant to Insurance Laws, APS and/or the APS Insurance
Subsidiaries are entitled to take credit for reinsurance under the APS
Reinsurance Treaties. APS is unaware of any material adverse change in the
financial condition of its reinsurers that might raise concern regarding their
ability to honor their reinsurance commitments or of any disputes regarding
the collectability of such receivables, except as set forth in Section 3.23(c)
of the APS Disclosure Schedule. No party to any of the APS Reinsurance
Treaties has given written notice to APS or any APS Subsidiary that such party
intends to terminate or cancel any of the APS Reinsurance Treaties as a result
of or following consummation of the Merger. Each APS Reinsurance Treaty is
valid and binding on each party thereto, and none of APS, and, to the
Knowledge of APS, any other party thereto, is in default in any material
respect with respect to any such reinsurance agreement or treaty. No APS
Reinsurance Treaty contains any provision providing that the other party
thereto may terminate the same by reason of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or contains any other provision which would be altered or
otherwise become applicable by reason of such transactions. Since January 1,
2007 no APS Reinsurance Treaty has been canceled and there has not been any
change in the retention level under any of such reinsurance agreements or
treaties.

 

(d)

 

The reserves of API Insurance reflected in the APS SAP Statements, gross and
net of the reinsurance thereof (collectively, the "APS Reserves"), were
prepared in accordance with the requirements for reserves established by the
Insurance Regulators, were determined in accordance with SAP and generally
accepted actuarial principles consistently applied, were computed on the basis
of methodologies consistent in all material respects with those used in prior
periods, were fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with sound
actuarial and statutory accounting principles, and were established in
accordance with prudent insurance practices generally followed in the
insurance industry. The APS Reserves have been analyzed by a nationally
recognized actuary pursuant to the reserve analysis identified in Section
3.23(d) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, and management of APS has no
disagreements with such actuary in its analysis. Except for regular periodic
assessments based on developments that are publicly known within the insurance
industry, no claim or assessment is pending or threatened against APS or any
APS Subsidiary which is peculiar or unique to APS or such APS Subsidiary by
any state insurance guaranty association in connection with such associations
fund relating to insolvent insurers.

Section 3.23(e) of the APS Disclosure Schedule lists each consulting actuary,
independent or otherwise, that has reviewed, on behalf of APS or any APS
Subsidiary, the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses of APS or API
Insurance and their premium rates for liability insurance and issued a written
report in each of the years commencing after December 31, 2007 (collectively
the "APS Actuaries" and separately an "APS Actuary"). Section 3.23(e) of the
APS Disclosure Schedule lists each and every actuarial report, and all
attachments, supplements, addenda and modifications thereto prepared for or on
behalf of APS or any APS Subsidiary by the APS Actuaries, or delivered by the
APS Actuaries to APS or any APS Subsidiary, since December 31, 2007, in which
an APS Actuary has (i) either expressed an opinion on the adequacy of such
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses loss reserves or made
recommendations as to either the amount of reserves for losses and loss
adjustment expenses that should be maintained by APS or API Insurance, or (ii)
expressed an opinion as to the adequacy of such premiums or made a
recommendation as to the premiums that should be charged by APS or API
Insurance for liability insurance (collectively, the "APS Actuarial
Analyses"). To the Knowledge of APS the information and data furnished by APS
or any APS Subsidiary to the APS Actuaries in connection with the APS
Actuarial Analyses were accurate in all material respects. APS has made
available to PRA a true and correct copy of each of the APS Actuarial
Analyses.

 

(f)

 

To the Knowledge of APS, there are no inquiries from any applicable
Governmental Authority related to the Business that could reasonably be
expected to result in APS or the Surviving Corporation being liable for any
market conduct claim with respect to the marketing and sale of insurance
products.

 

(g)

 

No outstanding insurance contract issued, reinsured, or underwritten by API
Insurance entitles the holder thereof or any other Person to receive
dividends, distributions, or to share in the income of APS or to receive any
other benefits based on the revenues or earnings of APS or any other Person.

 

(h)

 

Each insurance agent or broker, at the time such agent or broker wrote, sold
or produced business for API Insurance or an APS Agency, to the extent
required by law, was duly appointed to act as agent and was duly licensed as
an insurance agent or broker (for the type of business written, sold or
produced by such insurance agent or broker) in the particular jurisdiction in
which such agent or broker wrote, sold or produced such business, and no such
insurance agent or broker violated (or with or without notice or lapse of time
or both would have violated) in any material respect any term or provision of
any law or regulation applicable to any aspect (including but not limited to,
the marketing, sale or production) of the business of APS and the APS
Subsidiaries.

form, in all material respects, with the provisions of Regulation 14A of the
Exchange Act and other applicable laws). PRA and APS will use all reasonable
efforts to respond to the comments of the SEC staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement. As soon as practicable after SEC comments, if any, on the
preliminary Proxy Statement are resolved, APS shall mail or deliver the
definitive Proxy Statement to its shareholders in accordance with Regulation
14A under the Exchange Act. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, APS shall provide PRA with an opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response and shall include in such document or
response comments reasonably proposed by PRA. The information provided and to
be provided by PRA and APS for use in the Proxy Statement will not, on such
date and on the date on which approval of the Merger by the shareholders of
APS is obtained, contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. Each of PRA and APS agree promptly to correct any such
information provided by it which shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect and to take all steps necessary to file with the SEC and have
cleared by the SEC any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so as to
correct the same and to cause the Proxy Statement so corrected to be
distributed to the shareholders of APS to the extent required by applicable
law. To the extent that any disclosure regarding the tax consequences of the
Merger is required with respect to the Proxy Statement, APS will be
responsible for any tax opinion in support of the disclosure of the material
tax consequences.

 

(b)

 

To the extent applicable, APS and PRA shall prepare and file with all
necessary Governmental Authorities (i) a Notice on Form A and related
documents and (ii) the preacquisition notification and report forms and
related material on Form E in connection with the Merger.

 

(c)

 

Pursuant to the HSR Act, PRA and APS will promptly prepare and file, or cause
to be filed, the HSR Act Report with the Pre-Merger Notification Agencies in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which filing shall
comply as to form with all requirements applicable thereto and all of the data
and information reported therein shall be accurate and complete in all
material respects. Each of PRA and APS will promptly comply with all
requests, if any, of the Pre-Merger Notification Agencies for additional
information or documentation in connection with the HSR Act Report forms filed
by or on behalf of each of such parties pursuant to the HSR Act, and all such
additional information or documentation shall comply as to form with all
requirements applicable thereto and shall be accurate and complete in all
material respects.

 


  

 

34

  (d)

 

Each party shall provide to the other, (i) promptly after filing thereof,
copies of all statements, applications, correspondence or forms filed by such
party prior to the Closing Date with the SEC, the Pre-Merger Notification
Agencies, the Insurance Regulators and any other Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
promptly after delivery to, or receipt from, such regulatory authorities, all
written communications, letters, reports or other documents relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall
require either party to provide the other with documents or information that
is competitively or commercially sensitive.

 

(e)

 

The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation,
to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as
promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all third parties and Governmental Authorities which are necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions of all
such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such Governmental
Authorities. PRA and APS shall have the right to review in advance, and, to
the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject
to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to PRA or APS, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing in
this paragraph shall require either party to provide the other with documents
or information that is competitively or commercially sensitive. The
cooperation and coordination of each party required under this Section 6.1
shall include giving timely public notice of any public hearings regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and having its representatives
attend and testify at such public hearings. In addition, each of the parties
hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties
hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f)

 

PRA will furnish to APS the information relating to it required by the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set
forth in the Proxy Statement. PRA and APS shall, upon request, furnish each
other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries,
directors, officers and stockholders/shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of PRA, APS or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

 

(g)

 

PRA and APS shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication
from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval is required for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes
such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite
Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such
approval will be materially delayed.

  6.2

 

 _Access to Information._

 

(a)

 

From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 8, upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information and to the
Confidentiality Agreement dated December 14, 2009 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), each of PRA and APS shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other representatives of the other party, reasonable access,
during normal business hours upon reasonable notice, to all its properties,
books, contracts, commitments and records, as the other party may reasonably
request, and, during such period, each of PRA and APS shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws or state insurance laws (other than reports or documents which
PRA or APS, as the case may be, is not permitted to disclose under applicable
law or by agreement); (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request; and (iii) any
other information, confidential or otherwise, relating to the Merger which has
not been provided to the other party and is necessary for disclosure in the
Proxy Statement, including, but not limited to, the confidential portions of
the minutes of APS and APS Subsidiaries that were not provided pursuant to
Section 3.3 of this Agreement. Neither PRA nor APS nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would unreasonably disrupt the
operations of such other party or its Subsidiaries, violate or prejudice the
rights of PRAs or APSs, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client and work product privileges of the entity in possession or
control of such information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to
the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will use commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

(b)

 

Each of PRA and APS agrees to keep confidential, and not divulge to any other
party or Person (other than employees of, and attorneys, accountants,
financial advisors and other representatives for, any said party who agree to
be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement), all non-public documents,
information, records and financial statements received from the other and, in
addition, any and all reports, information and financial information obtained
through audits or other reviews conducted pursuant to this Agreement (unless
readily ascertainable from public or published information, or trade sources,
or already known or subsequently developed by a party independently of any
investigation or received from a third party not under an obligation to the
other party to keep such information confidential), and to use the same only
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated for any
reason, each party agrees to promptly return to the other party all written
materials furnished by the other party, and all copies thereof, in connection
with such investigation, and to destroy all documents and records in its
possession containing extracts or summaries of any such non-public
information.

 

(c)

 

No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or conditions of the
other set forth in this Agreement.

 

6.3

 

 _APS Shareholder Approval_. APS shall call a meeting of its shareholders to
be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC or its staff advises
that it has no further comments to the Proxy Statement for the purpose of
obtaining the requisite APS shareholder approval required in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger. APS will, through its board of directors,
subject to Section 6.7(a) and the fiduciary obligations of the board of
directors, recommend to its shareholders approval of this Agreement and the
Merger.

 


  

 

36

  6.4

 

 _Employee Plans. _

 

(a)

 

From and after the Effective Time, the APS Employee Plans in effect as of the
date of this Agreement and at the Effective Time shall remain in effect with
respect to the current and former employees of APS and the APS Subsidiaries
(the "APS Employees") covered by such APS Employee Plans at the Effective
Time, until such time as PRA shall otherwise determine. PRA agrees that it
will honor all APS Employee Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect
at the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that
may be required or permitted by the plans or applicable law. In the event
employee compensation and/or benefits as currently provided by APS or any APS
Subsidiary are changed or terminated by PRA, in whole or in part, PRA shall
provide any APS Employees who continue in employment with PRA (the "Continuing
Employees") with compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate,
substantially similar to the compensation and benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of PRA or applicable PRA Subsidiary (as of the date any
such compensation or benefit is provided). In accordance with and not in
limitation of the provisions of this Section 6.4(a) and Section 6.4(b) below,
APS shall, if requested by PRA, terminate the 401(k) Plan immediately
preceding the Effective Time, in which event the Continuing Employees shall be
eligible to participate in the retirement plan of PRA immediately after the
Effective Time and the Continuing Employees will be allowed to transfer their
accounts in the 401(k) Plan to the PRA retirement plan. APS shall authorize
the administrator of the 401(k) Plan to provide PRA information for use in its
determination whether to terminate the 401(k) Plan prior to the Effective Time
or to continue the 401(k) Plan after the Effective Time until it can be merged
into the PRA retirement plan. In the event PRA requests the termination of
the APS 401(k) Plan, any Continuing Employee who so elects, shall be permitted
to elect a direct rollover of any distribution from the APS 401(k) Plan to the
PRA retirement plan, including any outstanding participant loan balance, so as
to avoid a deemed distribution and consequent income taxation of such loan
balance to such Continuing Employee.

 

(b)

 

Subject to the provisions of Section 6.4(a) above, PRA shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to make the Continuing Employees eligible to participate in
Employee Plans provided to similarly situated employees of PRA or applicable
PRA Subsidiary ("PRA Employee Plans") effective on January 1 following the
Effective Time (the "First Eligibility Date") unless the Effective Time
occurs in the fourth calendar quarter in which event the Continuing Employees
shall become eligible to participate in the PRA Employee Plans no later than
January 1 following the First Eligibility Date. The Continuing Employees who
become participants in a PRA Employee Plan shall, for purposes of determining
eligibility for and for any applicable vesting periods of such employee
benefits only (and not for benefit accrual purposes unless specifically set
forth herein) be given credit for meeting eligibility and vesting requirements
in such plans for service as an employee of APS or any predecessor thereto
prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that credit for benefit
accrual purposes will be given only for purposes of PRA vacation policies or
programs. In the event of any termination or consolidation of any APS health
plan with any PRA health plan, PRA shall make available to the Continuing
Employees and their dependents employer-provided health coverage on
substantially the same basis as it provides such coverage to PRA employees.
Unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage under an APS
health plan prior to the time that such Continuing Employee becomes eligible
to participate in the PRA health plan, or unless a Continuing Employee and/or
a dependent of a Continuing Employee has an event which, under the terms of
the APS health plan, results in a loss of coverage (which may include a sale
or other disposition of an APS Subsidiary or substantially all of the business
operations thereof), no coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their
dependents shall terminate under any of the APS health plans prior to the time
such Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible to participate
in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees of PRA and
their dependents. In the event of a termination or consolidation of any APS
health plan, terminated APS employees and qualified beneficiaries will have
the right to continued coverage under group health plans of PRA in accordance
with Code Section 4980B(f), consistent with the provisions below. In the
event of any termination of any APS health plan, or consolidation of any APS
health plan with any PRA health plan, any coverage limitation under the PRA
health plan due to any pre-existing condition shall be waived by the PRA
health plan to the degree that such condition was covered by the APS health
plan and such condition would otherwise have been covered by the PRA health
plan in the absence of such coverage limitation. All APS Employees who cease
participating in an APS health plan and become participants in a comparable
PRA health plan during any plan year shall receive credit toward the
applicable deductible under the PRA health plan for any amounts paid by the
employee under APSs health plan during the applicable plan year, upon
substantiation, in a form satisfactory to PRA that such payments have been
made.

 


  

 

37

  (c)

 

It is understood that PRA and its Subsidiaries are "at-will" employers.
Nothing in this Section 6.4 (other than as set forth in Section 6.4(d) and
6.4(e)) shall be interpreted as preventing PRA from terminating the employment
of any individual or from amending, modifying or terminating any PRA Employee
Plans, or any APS Employee Plans, or any benefits under any PRA Employee Plans
or any APS Employee Plans, or any other contracts, arrangements, commitments
or understandings, in accordance with their terms and applicable law. 

 

(d)

 

Section 6.4(d) of the APS Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all Persons
who are entitled to change of control or severance benefits under the terms of
their respective employment agreements with APS or an APS Subsidiary (the
"Employment Agreements"), which list sets forth the name of each Person
entitled to such benefits and the amounts payable to each of such Persons on a
change of control and/or separation from employment, provided that the amounts
are subject to Section 5.13 of each of the Employment Agreements. PRA shall
offer to amend the Employment Agreements of the Persons listed in Section
6.4(d) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, consistent with the terms set forth in
Section 6.4(d) of the PRA Disclosure Schedule under an agreement to be
executed on or before the Effective Time in substantially the form of the
agreements included as an exhibit to Section 6.4(d) of the PRA Disclosure
Schedule (the "Amendment Agreement"). In the event any Person listed on
Section 6.4(d) of the APS Disclosure Schedule fails to execute an Amendment
Agreement at the Effective Time, PRA shall pay to such Person the change of
control or severance benefits described in Schedule 6.4(d) of the APS
Disclosure Schedule after giving effect to Section 5.13 of each of the
Employment Agreements; provided that PRA shall require in connection with such
payments that each officer or employee receiving a payment shall execute a
resignation and release, in the form attached to Section 6.4(d) of the PRA
Disclosure Schedule.

 

An initial determination as to whether any payment or benefit within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code paid or payable or distributed or
distributable to the executive pursuant to the terms of the Employment
Agreement or otherwise in connection with, or arising out of the executive\'s
employment with the Company or the Merger will be subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax") shall be made by the
Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors of ProAssurance. In making
such determination, the value of any noncash benefits or any deferred payment
or benefit shall be determined in accordance with the principles set forth in
Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. ProAssurance shall provide the
determination ("Determination") together with detailed supporting calculations
and documentation to the executive prior to delivery of an opinion from its
tax adviser and a reasonable time prior to reporting the payments to the
Internal Revenue Service or in connection with any subsequent tax dispute or
claim for refund between the executive and the Internal Revenue Service.
Within ten (10) days of the delivery of the Determination to the executive,
the executive shall have the right to dispute the Determination by providing
written notice of the specific bases for the objection with calculations and
documentation in support thereof. In the event of any dispute, controversy or
claim by or among the executive, the Company or ProAssurance arising out of or
relating to the Determination (a "Dispute"), the disputing parties or their
representatives will meet at a mutually agreed upon place and time as soon as
reasonably possible (but not later than ten (10) days after notice of the
written notice of Dispute) and shall enter into good faith negotiations aimed
at resolving the Dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute in
a mutually satisfactory manner within ten (10) days from the date of such
meeting, the disputing parties will proceed as follows. 

 

The disputing parties will endeavor to choose a mutually-acceptable mediator
and mediation process to supplement their efforts at negotiating a resolution
of any Dispute. The mediator shall be an experienced attorney, CPA or other
tax professional knowledgeable regarding Code Section 280G and the substance
of the issues subject to Dispute in the Determination. If the parties cannot
agree on a mediation process within ten (10) days after any party has, by
notice to each other disputing party, demanded mediation, then the parties
shall engage in good faith mediation under the auspices of JAMS, using a
mediator sitting in the Austin, Texas metropolitan area and otherwise in
accordance with the JAMS Mediation Rules and Procedures then in effect. The
Company will bear the costs of mediation, including the fees and expenses of
the mediator. Each disputing party shall be responsible for its own legal and
other professional fees and expenses incurred in connection with such
mediation. If the parties cannot agree on a mediator within ten (10) days
after the initiation of mediation efforts through JAMS, any disputing party
may request JAMS to appoint a neutral mediator in the Austin, Texas,
metropolitan area, and each disputing party shall agree to such appointment
except for good cause shown. 

 



 


  

 

38

  In the event of a Dispute, ProAssurance shall have the right to delay payment
of that portion of the disputed amount that would potentially trigger the
obligation to report and withhold the Excise Tax pending completion of the
negotiation and mediation dispute resolution process described above;
_provided, however_ , all undisputed amounts shall be paid in the form and at
the time otherwise required by the Employment Agreement, plans or other
applicable documents. If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute
through the negotiation and mediation dispute resolution process described
above, ProAssurance will have the right to report and withhold the Excise Tax
upon payment of the remaining amounts subject to Dispute. Nothing herein will
limit the legal or equitable remedies or actions otherwise available to the
Executive, including without limitation the right to claim reimbursement for
any amounts that should have been paid to the Executive. If there is no
Dispute, the Determination will be binding, final and conclusive upon the
Company, ProAssurance and the executive.

 

(e)

 

PRA shall assume and honor in accordance with their terms the agreements
listed in Section 6.4(e) of the APS Disclosure Schedule with respect to the
provision of benefits to current or former employees beyond their retirement
or other termination of service, which obligations shall survive the
termination of any employment agreements pursuant to Section 6.4(c).

 

(f)

 

PRA agrees that APS and the APS Subsidiaries may pay their employees
performance-based, annual incentive compensation for the year ending December
31, 2010 (the "2010 Bonus Compensation"); provided that the 2010 Bonus
Compensation shall be determined by the compensation committee of APS, that
the total amount of the 2010 Bonus Compensation shall not exceed $2,050,000,
and that the 2010 Bonus Compensation shall be payable as herein provided. APS
shall deliver to PRA prior to Closing a written schedule reflecting the amount
of the 2010 Bonus Compensation, if any, to be paid to the individual employees
of APS and the APS Subsidiaries at the time of Closing, which schedule shall
reflect the name and position of each employee entitled to receive part of the
2010 Bonus Compensation and the amount of the 2010 Bonus Compensation to be
paid to each of the named employees (the "2010 Bonus Schedule"). PRA shall
cause APS and the APS Subsidiaries to pay to the employees named on the 2010
Bonus Schedule the amount of the 2010 Bonus Compensation reflected on the 2010
Bonus Schedule as payable to each of said employees. The 2010 Bonus
Compensation shall be paid to the employees then employed by APS and the APS
Subsidiaries no sooner than February 28, 2011 nor later than March 15, 2011,
except that the 2010 Bonus Compensation may be sooner paid (i) to an employee
upon termination of employment if such employment is terminated by the
employer without cause after December 31, 2010 or (ii) to an employee named in
Section 6.4(d) of the APS Disclosure Schedule immediately prior to the
Closing. Each employee named on the 2010 Bonus Schedule shall be a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement for the purpose of receiving the amounts
set forth in the 2010 Bonus Schedule in accordance with this Section 6.4(f).

 

(g)

 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all payments made to the APS
Employees under this Section 6.4 shall be subject to withholding required by
applicable federal, state and local taxing authorities.

 

(h)

 

The Persons to whom Sections 6.4(d) and 6.4(e) apply shall be third party
beneficiaries of such sections. The provisions of Sections 6.4(d) and 6.4(e)
are intended to be for the benefit of each such Person and his or her
successors, heirs or representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, shall (i) be treated as an
amendment or other modification of any APS Employee Plan or any PRA Employee
Plan or (ii) limit the right of APS or PRA or its respective affiliates or
Subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any benefit plan
following the Effective Time.

 

(i)

 

The obligations of the parties to this Agreement under this Section 6.4 shall
survive after the Effective Time in accordance with the terms herein this
Section 6.4.

 

6.5

 

 _WARN Act_. PRA agrees to provide any required notice under the WARN Act and
any other applicable law after the Effective Time and to otherwise comply with
any such statute with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as
defined in the WARN Act or any other applicable law) or similar event
affecting employees and occurring on or after the Effective Time.

 


  

 

39

  6.6

 

 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance. _

 

(a)

 

PRA shall use its best efforts to cause the individuals serving as officers
and directors of APS and the APS Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time as listed in Section 6.6(a) of the APS Disclosure Schedule, to
be covered for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time (or the
period of the applicable statute of limitations, if longer) by the directors
and officers liability insurance policy maintained by APS or the APS
Subsidiary (provided that PRA may substitute policies of the same or
substantially similar coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions
which are not less advantageous in any material respect than such policy) with
respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were
committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such; provided,
however, that in no event shall PRA be required to expend more than 400% of
the current amount expended by APS or the APS Subsidiary (400% of such current
amount is referred to herein as the "Insurance Premium Amount") to maintain or
procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto; and provided further, that if PRA
is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.6,
PRA shall use its best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as
available for the Insurance Premium Amount.

 

(b)

 

In addition to the indemnification under Sections 6.6(a) and 6.6(c), PRA shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or APS Subsidiary, as the case may be, to
honor in accordance with their terms all agreements and commitments to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Person who is now, or who has been at
any time before the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time, an
officer, director or employee of APS or an APS Subsidiary (collectively the
"Indemnified Parties" and individually, each an "Indemnified Party"), against
all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees),
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, or administrative (each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified
Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole or in part
on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of APS or an APS Subsidiary, as the case may be,
if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at
or before the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim
is asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent APS or an APS Subsidiary, as the case may be, is permitted under
Organizational Documents of APS or an APS Subsidiary, as the case may be,
applicable law and the indemnity arrangements in effect as of the date of this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Surviving Corporation and each APS
Subsidiary shall be liable only for its own obligations under this Section
6.6(b) and PRA, the Surviving Corporation or any APS Subsidiary shall not be
liable for the obligations of any other APS Subsidiary or APS, as the case may
be. Section 6.6(b) of the APS Disclosure Schedule lists each Indemnified Party
who is now or has been at any time since January 1, 2000 an officer or
director of APS or an APS Subsidiary, or who is now or has been at any time
since January 1, 2008 an employee of APS or an APS Subsidiary. PRA shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and APS Subsidiary, as the case may be, to pay
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Claim to each Indemnified
Party to the full extent provided in the Organizational Documents of APS or
the APS Subsidiary, as the case may be, as of the date of this Agreement. The
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after
consultation with the Surviving Corporation or APS Subsidiary, as the case may
be; provided, however, that (i) the Surviving Corporation or the APS
Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and upon such assumption the Surviving Corporation or APS Subsidiary,
as the case may be, shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the
Surviving Corporation or APS Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects not to
assume such defense the Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to him after consultation with the Surviving Corporation or APS
Subsidiary, as the case may be, and PRA shall cause the Surviving Corporation
or APS Subsidiary, as the case may be, to pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Surviving
Corporation or APS Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall be obligated pursuant
to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties except to the extent representation by a single firm or attorney is,
in the absence of an informed consent by the Indemnified Party, prohibited by
ethical rules relating to lawyers conflicts of interest, (iii) the Surviving
Corporation or APS Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld), (iv) the Surviving Corporation or APS Subsidiary,
as the case may be, shall have no obligation hereunder to any employee of APS
Financial with respect to any claim arising from a violation of the Securities
Laws, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that the Persons
listed on Section 6.6(b)(iv) of the APS Disclosure Schedule are not, and at no

 


  

 

40

  time have been, employees of APS Financial, it being acknowledged that such
persons were serving as officers or directors of APS Financial at the request
of each APS Subsidiary, (v) the Surviving Corporation or APS Subsidiary, as
the case may be, shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party
when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and
such determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated by this
Agreement is prohibited by applicable law, and (vi) the Surviving Corporation
or APS Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall have no obligation hereunder to
any Indemnified Party for which and to the extent payment is actually and
unqualifiedly made to such Indemnified Party under any insurance policy, any
other agreement for indemnification or otherwise. The Surviving Corporation or
APS Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall not enter into any settlement
agreement on behalf of any Indemnified Party unless such settlement agreement
contains a full release of all claims. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
Indemnification under this Section 6.6(b), upon learning of any Claim shall
notify the Surviving Corporation or APS Subsidiary, as the case may be,
thereof, provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation or APS Subsidiary, as the case may
be, under this Section 6.6(b) except to the extent such failure to notify
materially prejudices the Surviving Corporation or APS Subsidiary, as the case
may be. The Surviving Corporations and APS Subsidiaries obligations under
this Section 6.6(b) continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time (or the period of the applicable statute of
limitations, if longer); provided, however, that all rights to indemnification
in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such period shall continue
until the final disposition of such Claim.

 

(c)

 

In addition to the indemnification under Sections 6.6(a) and 6.6(b), as of the
Closing, PRA shall fully assume and agrees to pay, perform and discharge all
obligations of APS under indemnity agreements (the "Indemnity Agreements") for

 _Advice of Changes._

 

(a)

 

PRA and APS shall give prompt notice to the other party as soon as practicable
after it has actual Knowledge of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of
any event which would or would be likely to cause any partys representations
or warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue or incorrect in any
material respect at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing
Date, or (ii) any failure on its part to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by such party under this Agreement. Each party shall have the right
to deliver to the other party a written disclosure schedule as to any matter
of which it becomes aware following execution of this Agreement which would
constitute a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of this
Agreement by such party, identifying on such disclosure schedule the
representation, warranty or covenant which would be so breached, provided that
if the failure of such representation, warranty or covenant would reasonably
be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of the other party
to effect the Merger and the other transactions provided for in this Agreement
not to be satisfied, then each such disclosure schedule shall be delivered as
soon as practicable after such party becomes aware of the matter disclosed
therein. The nondisclosing party shall have ten (10) business days from
receipt of such disclosure schedule to notify the disclosing party that (x) it
will close notwithstanding the new disclosure, or (y) it will not close based
on such new disclosure, or (z) further investigation or negotiation is
required for it to reach a determination whether or not to close based on such
new disclosure. If the parties thereafter are unable to reach agreement on a
mutually satisfactory means of resolving the matter so disclosed, the
nondisclosing party shall have the right, in its discretion, to terminate this
Agreement to the extent such termination is permitted under Section 8.1 of
this Agreement.

  (b)

 

PRA shall update the PRA Disclosure Schedule (the "Closing Date PRA Disclosure
Schedule") to a date that is no earlier than ten (10) business days prior to
the Closing Date and no later than seven (7) business days prior to the

Closing Date and shall deliver the Closing Date APS Disclosure Schedule to PRA
not less than three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date. The
obligation of PRA to deliver to APS the Closing Date PRA Disclosure Schedule
as provided above shall be a material obligation for purposes of Section
7.3(b) hereof, and the obligation of APS to deliver to PRA the Closing Date
APS Disclosure Schedule shall be a material obligation for purposes of Section
7.2(b) hereof.

 

6.8

further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of PRA and an APS
Subsidiary) or to vest PRA or any of its Subsidiaries with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
parties to this Agreement or the Merger, the proper officers and directors of
each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all
such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole
expense of, PRA.

 

6.9

 

 _Negotiations with Other Parties._

 

(a)

 

So long as this Agreement remains in effect and no notice of termination has
been given under this Agreement, APS shall not authorize or knowingly permit
any of its representatives, directly or indirectly, to initiate, entertain,
solicit, encourage, engage in, or participate in, negotiations with any Person
or any group of Persons other than the other party to this Agreement or any of
its affiliates concerning any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section
6.9(c) of this Agreement) other than as expressly provided in this Agreement.
APS will promptly inform PRA of any serious, bona fide inquiry it may receive
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall furnish to PRA a copy
thereof.

 

(b)

 

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit APS or its board of
directors from making such disclosures to its shareholders as are required
under the Securities Laws or the rules of FINRA or the Nasdaq National Market
or from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the board of directors of APS from either furnishing
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person
or group of Persons regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or approving and
recommending to the shareholders of APS an Acquisition Proposal from any
Person or group of Persons, if the board of directors of APS determines in
good faith that failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law. In connection with any such
determination, (i) APS shall direct its officers and other appropriate
personnel to cooperate with and be reasonably available to consult with any
such Person or group of Persons, (ii) APS will disclose to PRA that it is
furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
such Person or group of Persons, which disclosure shall describe the terms
thereof (but need not identify the Person or group of Persons making the
offer), (iii) prior to furnishing such information to such Person or group of
Persons, APS shall enter into a written agreement with such Person or group of
Persons which provides for, among other things, (A) the furnishing to APS of
information regarding such Person or group of Persons that is relevant to its
ability to finance and otherwise perform its obligations under its Acquisition
Proposal; (B) the confidentiality of all non-public information furnished to
such Person or group of Persons by APS; and (C) procedures reasonably
satisfactory to APS that are designed to restrict or limit the provision of
information regarding APS that could be used to the competitive disadvantage
of APS, or in a manner that would be detrimental to the interests of its
shareholders; (iv) APS will not furnish any non-public information regarding
PRA or the transactions contemplated hereby; and (v) APS will keep PRA
informed of the status of any such discussions or negotiations (provided that
APS shall not be required to disclose to PRA confidential information
concerning the business or operations of such Person or group of Persons). 

 


  

 

42

  (c)

 

As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means (i) any proposal for a
transaction or series of transactions that would result in any Person or group
of Persons, other than PRA or APS, having the right to vote, or direct the
vote of, fifteen percent (15%) or more of the capital stock of APS or any of
the APS Subsidiaries entitled to vote thereon for the election of directors;
(ii) any proposal for a transaction or series of transactions that could
result in any Person acquiring fifteen percent (15%) or more of the assets of
APS and the APS Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than in the ordinary
course of business; (iii) any proposal for a transaction or series of
transactions that would result in any Person being the beneficial owner of
more than fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding capital stock and other
voting securities of APS, other than as contemplated by this Agreement; or
(iv) any proposal for a transaction similar to the foregoing. 

 

(d)

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of directors of APS shall not
recommend an Acquisition Proposal to its shareholders pursuant to Section
6.9(b) unless APS shall have delivered to PRA prior written notice advising
PRA that APS or its board of directors intends to take such action with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal, specifying in reasonable detail the
material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, this notice to be
delivered not less than five (5) business days prior to the time the action is
taken, and, during this five (5) business day period, PRA shall have the
right, and upon exercise of such right, APS and its advisors shall negotiate
in good faith with PRA, to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer
constitute a superior proposal.

 

6.10

 

 _Preferred Stock Redemption_. Prior to the record date for the APS
shareholders meeting to vote on the Merger, but in no event later than
September 30, 2010, APS shall redeem all issued and outstanding shares of APS

its terms been made as of a specific date in which case such representation or
warranty shall have been true and correct as of such specific date or (ii) for
any changes to the APS Disclosure Schedule that are disclosed by APS to PRA in
the Closing Date APS Disclosure Schedule); provided, however, that if the
failure of any such representations and warranties to be true and correct on
and as of the Closing Date, individually or in the aggregate, has not resulted
or reasonably could not be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
APS and the APS Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the foregoing condition shall
be deemed to have been fulfilled; provided, further, that the delivery of the

Effective Time of the following conditions:

 

(a)

 

Each of PRA and NEWCO shall have performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to
the Closing Date, and APS shall have received a certificate signed on behalf
of PRA by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of PRA
to such effect.

 

(b)

 

The representations and warranties of PRA and NEWCO contained in this
Agreement shall be true and correct on and as of the Closing Date as if made
on and as of such date (except (i) to the extent that any such representation
or warranty has by its terms been made as of a specific date in which case
such representation and warranty shall have been true and correct as of such
specific date or (ii) for any changes to the PRA Disclosure Schedule that are
disclosed by PRA to APS in the Closing Date PRA Disclosure Schedule);
provided, however, that if the failure of any such representations and
warranties to be true and correct on and as of the Closing Date would not
reasonably be expected to prevent the consummation of the Merger, the
foregoing condition shall be deemed to have been fulfilled; provided, further,
that the delivery of the Closing Date PRA Disclosure Schedule is subject to

Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the shareholders of APS:

 

(a)

 

by mutual consent of PRA and APS in a written instrument, if the board of
directors of PRA and the board of directors of APS so determine to terminate
this Agreement by an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of each
board;

 

(b)

 

by either PRA or APS if (i) any Governmental Authority which must grant a

denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) the board of directors
of PRA or the board of directors of APS, as the case may be, determines to
terminate this Agreement by an affirmative vote of a majority of the members
of its entire board;

 

(c)

 

by either PRA or APS (provided that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained in this Agreement) if (i) there shall have been a breach of any of
the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of
the other party, which breach is not cured within forty-five (45) days
following written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach,
by its nature or timing, cannot be cured prior to the Closing Date, and (ii)
the board of directors of PRA or the board of directors of APS, as the case
may be, determines to terminate this Agreement by an affirmative vote of a
majority of the members of its entire board; provided, however, that no
representation or warranty of either party contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed untrue or incorrect, and neither party shall be deemed to have
breached a representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of
any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event,
individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances or events
inconsistent with any representation or warranty, has had or is reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on such party;

 

(d)

 

by PRA upon written notice to APS if the board of directors of APS does not,
or shall indicate in writing to PRA that APS is unwilling or unable to,
publicly recommend in the Proxy Statement that its shareholders approve and
adopt this Agreement, or if after recommending in the Proxy Statement that its
shareholders approve and adopt this Agreement, the board of directors of APS
shall have withdrawn, modified or amended such recommendation in any respect
materially adverse to PRA (each an "APS Recommendation Event"), provided that
any such notice of termination must be given not later than forty-five (45)
days after the later of the date PRA shall have been advised by APS in writing
that APS is unable or unwilling to so recommend in the Proxy Statement or that
it has withdrawn, modified or amended such recommendation, or such later date
as may be agreed upon by PRA and APS;

 

(e)

 

by PRA upon written notice to APS if APS shall have authorized, recommended,
approved, proposed, or entered into an agreement with any Person other than
PRA or NEWCO to effect an Acquisition Proposal;

 

(f)

 

by either PRA or APS if approval of the shareholders of APS required for the
consummation of the Merger shall not have been obtained by reason of the
failure to obtain the required vote at a duly held meeting of shareholders or
at any adjournment or postponement thereof;

 

(g)

 

by PRA if the Closing Date APS Disclosure Schedule discloses any Material
Adverse Effect on APS or any change from the APS Disclosure Schedule which
has, or is likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on APS;

 

(h)

 

by written notice from APS to PRA, or from PRA to APS, if the Closing does not
occur on or before the date that is twelve (12) months following the date of
this Agreement, for any reason other than breach of this Agreement by the
party giving such notice;

 


  

 

45

  (i)

 

by APS upon the occurrence of an APS Acquisition Event (as defined in Section
8.5(a) hereof) or APS Recommendation Event, provided that APS shall not have
the right to terminate unless it has complied with the terms and conditions of
Section 6.9(d);

 

(j)

 

by APS if approval of the shareholders of APS required for the consummation of
the Merger shall have been obtained but PRA fails to meet its obligation under
Section 2.2 to fund the Merger Consideration, and such failure has not been
cured within five (5) business days; or

 

(k)

 

by PRA if APS fails to call and hold the meeting of its shareholders as
required by Section 6.3 of this Agreement; provided, however, that the failure
of shareholders holding shares constituting a quorum to attend in person or by
proxy a meeting duly called for the purpose of approving the Merger shall not
constitute a failure of APS to call and hold a meeting of its shareholders as
required by Section 6.3 of this Agreement.

 

8.2

 

 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either PRA or APS as provided in Section 8.1 of this Agreement, (i) this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, except that Sections
6.2(b), 8.2, 8.5, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.12, and 9.15 of this Agreement shall
survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) none of PRA, NEWCO, and
APS, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors
of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever under this
Agreement, or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5 of this Agreement;
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, neither PRA nor APS shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its willful breach of any provision of
this Agreement.

 

8.3

 

 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by the board
of directors of PRA and the board of directors of APS, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the
shareholders of APS; provided, however, that after any approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of APS, there
may not be any amendment of this Agreement that by law or in accordance with
the rules of any stock exchange requires further approval by the shareholders
of APS without such further approval of such shareholders. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties hereto.

 

8.4

 

 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties to
this Agreement may, to the extent legally allowed and subject to Section 8.3,
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other parties to this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a
party to this Agreement to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such
extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 


  

 

46

  8.5

 

 _Liquidated Damages; Termination Fee. _

 

(a)

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the
event that any of the following events or circumstances shall occur, APS
shall, within ten (10) business days after notice of the occurrence thereof by
PRA, pay to PRA the sum equal to $8,500,000 (which the parties agree and
stipulate as reasonable and full liquidated damages and reasonable
compensation for the involvement of PRA in the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement, is not a penalty or forfeiture, and will not affect the
provisions of this Section 8.5): (i) at any time prior to termination of this
Agreement an APS Acquisition Event shall occur; (ii) PRA shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to (x) Section 8.1(c) hereof as a result of a breach by APS
that would reasonably be expected to cause the conditions in Sections 7.1,
7.2(a) and 7.2(b) not to be satisfied on or prior to the date that is twelve
(12) months after the date of execution of this Agreement, (y) Section 8.1(d)
or (z) Section 8.1(e); (iii) APS shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(i), or (iv) PRA shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(k) unless APS failure to call and hold a meeting of its shareholders as
required by Section 6.3 is the result of any law, injunction, restraining
order or decree of any nature of any Governmental Authority. For purposes of
this Agreement an "APS Acquisition Event" shall mean that APS shall have
authorized, recommended, approved, or entered into an agreement with any
Person (other than any of the parties to this Agreement) to effect an
Acquisition Proposal or shall publicly announce an intention to recommend or
approve a tender offer or exchange offer by another Person based on an
Acquisition Proposal. Upon the making and receipt of such payment under this
Section 8.5(a), APS shall have no further obligation of any kind under this
Agreement and neither PRA nor NEWCO shall have any further obligation of any
kind under this Agreement, except in each case under Section 8.2 of this
Agreement, and no party shall have any liability for any breach or alleged
breach by such party of any provision of this Agreement.

 

(b)

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the
event that APS shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to (i) Section 8.1(c)
hereof as a result of a breach by PRA that would reasonably be expected to
cause the conditions in Sections 7.1 and 7.3 not to be satisfied on or prior
to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of execution of this
Agreement or (ii) Section 8.1(j) hereof, PRA shall, within ten (10) business
days after notice of the occurrence thereof by APS, pay to APS the sum equal
to $8,500,000 (which the parties agree and stipulate as reasonable and full
liquidated damages and reasonable compensation for the involvement of APS in
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, is not a penalty or
forfeiture, and will not affect the provisions of this Section 8.5(b)). Upon
the making and receipt of such payment under this Section 8.5(b), neither PRA
nor NEWCO shall have any further obligation of any kind under this Agreement
and APS shall have no further obligation of any kind under this Agreement,
except in each case under Section 8.2 of this Agreement, and no party shall
have any liability for any breach or alleged breach by such party of any
provision of this Agreement.
