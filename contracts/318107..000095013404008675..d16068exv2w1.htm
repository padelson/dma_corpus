AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 9, 2004 (the "Agreement"), by and among PETRO-CANADA (US) HOLDINGS LTD., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), RAVEN ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Subsidiary"), and PRIMA ENERGY CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain terms used in this Agreement are used as defined in Article VIII.   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company have each approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.   

 WHEREAS, Parent proposes to cause Merger Subsidiary to make a tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.015 per share, of the Company (the "Common Shares"), including associated rights ("Rights") to purchase preferred shares issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement (the Common Shares, together with the Rights, are hereinafter referred to individually as a "Share" and collectively, the "Shares"), at a price of $39.50 per Share (such amount, or any greater amount per Share paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the "Offer Price"), subject to any required withholding of Taxes, net to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (such tender offer, as it may be amended and supplemented from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the "Offer").   

 WHEREAS, after acquiring the Shares pursuant to the Offer, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), whereby each issued and outstanding Share not owned directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company, except as otherwise provided herein, will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price.   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) adopted resolutions approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, agreed to recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares and, if required by applicable law, adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.   

 WHEREAS, as an inducement to the Parent entering into this Agreement, certain Persons in their capacities as stockholders of the Company are concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement entering into agreements in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "Stockholder Agreements").   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:  

  

  

ARTICLE I   

THE OFFER

  

  

  

 SECTION 1.01. The Offer.   

 (a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable, and in any event no more than ten Business Days, after the date of this Agreement, Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent    ##### 

  

 

shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, commence, within the meaning of Rule l4d-2
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with
the rules and regulations thereunder (the "Exchange Act")), the Offer.
The obligation of Merger Subsidiary to, and of Parent to cause Merger
Subsidiary to, accept for payment and pay for any Shares tendered shall be
subject only to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Annex A and
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Parent and Merger Subsidiary
expressly reserve the right to waive any of the conditions to the Offer to
the extent legally permissible (other than the Minimum Condition (as defined
in Annex A), which may not be waived without the prior written consent of the
Company), to increase the price per Share payable in the Offer and to make
any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer except that,
without the prior written consent of the Company, no change may be made to
the Offer that would alter form of consideration to be paid, no decrease in
the Offer Price or the number of Shares sought in the Offer may be made, no
change which imposes additional conditions to the Offer or modifies any of
the conditions set forth in Annex A in any manner adverse to the holders of
the Shares may be made and neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary may extend
the Offer, except in accordance with Section 1.01(c).   

 (b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the "Schedule TO"), which shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws, and shall contain (including as an exhibit) or incorporate by reference the offer to purchase relating to the Offer and forms of the related letter of transmittal and other appropriate documents (which documents, as amended or supplemented from time to time, are referred to herein collectively as the "Offer Documents"). The Parent and the Merger Subsidiary further agree to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. In conducting the Offer, the Parent and the Merger Subsidiary shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and any other applicable laws necessary to be complied with in connection with the Offer. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Subsidiary all information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Companys stockholders that may be reasonably required or requested in connection with any action contemplated by this Section 1.01. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to their filing with the SEC. Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree to provide the Company, and to consult with the Company and its counsel regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff (whether written or oral) with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof and any responses thereto. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by law.   

 (c) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Offer shall remain open until midnight, New York City time, on the date that is 20 Business Days after the date the Offer is commenced; provided, however, that without the consent of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall have the right to extend the Offer (i) from time to time if, at any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived, until such conditions are satisfied or earlier waived; provided that if only the condition set forth in clause (y) of the first sentence of Annex A hereto is not satisfied or earlier waived, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall extend the Offer at the request of the Company (but in no event shall Parent and Merger Subsidiary be obligated to extend expiration of the Offer pursuant to this clause (i) beyond September 30, 2004); and provided further that Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall, upon the written request of the Company, extend the Offer for one or more periods not to exceed an aggregate of fifteen Business Days if, as of any expiration date, all of the conditions set forth in clause (z) are not satisfied, but such conditions are    ##### 

  

 

reasonably capable of being satisfied in such period, (ii) for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by
applicable law, (iii) on one or more occasions (all such occasions
aggregating not more than ten Business Days) beyond the latest expiration
that would otherwise be permitted under clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence,
if, on such expiration date, all of the conditions to Merger Subsidiarys
obligations to accept for payment Shares are satisfied or earlier waived, but
the number of Shares validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer, together with Shares then owned by Parent, represents less than 90% of
the outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis; provided, however, that
Parents decision to extend the Offer in the case of this clause (iii) shall
constitute a waiver of the conditions set forth in clauses (d) and (f)
(excluding any willful or intentional breach of any material obligation of
the Company) on Annex A and of its right to terminate the Agreement under
Sections 7.01(b), (d), (k) or (l) and (iv) for one or more subsequent
offering periods of up to an additional 20 Business Days in the aggregate
(collectively, the "Subsequent Period") pursuant to Rule 14d-11 of the
Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
shall also have the right to extend the Offer in accordance with Section
7.01(f).   

 (d) Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, accept for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration thereof (but in any event within three Business Days); provided that Merger Subsidiary shall immediately accept and promptly pay for all Shares as they are tendered during any Subsequent Period. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Subsidiary on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Subsidiary becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.  

  

  

 SECTION 1.02. Company Actions.   

 (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that the Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held prior to the date hereof, at which all of the directors were present, has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) adopted resolutions approving and adopting and declaring advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares and, if required by applicable law, adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, provided that such recommendation may be withdrawn, modified or amended in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.03, (iv) acknowledged that such approval is effective for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), (v) resolved to elect, to the extent permitted by law, not to be subject to any "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination," "fair price" or other form of anti-takeover laws and regulations of any jurisdiction that may purport to be applicable to this Agreement or the Stockholder Agreements and (vi) irrevocably taken all necessary steps to render Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the Offer and the transactions contemplated by the Stockholder Agreements. The Company further represents that Goldman, Sachs and Co. has delivered to the Board of Directors of the Company an opinion to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, and subject to the limitations and qualifications set forth therein, the consideration to be received by the holders of Shares (other than Parent and Merger Subsidiary) in the Offer and the Merger is fair from a financial point of view to such holders, and that the Company will deliver to Parent and Merger Subsidiary a true and correct copy of such opinion promptly after its receipt by the Company. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company described in the first sentence of this Section 1.02(a), subject to the right of the Companys Board of Directors to withdraw, modify or amend its    ##### 

  

 

recommendation in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.03. The Company
hereby represents and warrants that it has been advised that each of its
directors and executive officers intends to tender pursuant to the Offer any
and all Shares they own beneficially or of record.   

 (b) The Company shall file with the SEC on the date of commencement of the Offer a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the "Schedule 14D-9") that shall reflect, subject to the provisions of Section 5.03, the recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors referred to above, and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to stockholders of the Company as required by Rule 14D-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Subsidiary in mailing or otherwise disseminating the Schedule 14D-9 with the appropriate Offer Documents to the Companys stockholders. The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall deliver copies of the Schedule 14D-9 to Parent within a reasonable time prior to the filing thereof with the SEC for review and comment by Parent and its counsel (who shall provide any comments thereon as soon as reasonably practicable). The Company agrees to provide Parent, and to consult with Parent and its counsel regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff (whether written or oral) with respect to the Schedule 14D-promptly after receipt thereof and any responses thereto. Each of the Company, the Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company as and to the extent required by applicable laws.   

 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish Parent and Merger Subsidiary with (or cause Parent and Merger Subsidiary to be furnished with) mailing labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of a recent date, and shall furnish Parent and Merger Subsidiary with such additional information (including, without limitation, updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and assistance as Parent or Merger Subsidiary or its agents may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates to, hold in confidence the information contained in any of such labels, listings and files, use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and, if this Agreement is terminated, deliver to the Company all copies of such information or extracts therefrom then in their possession or under their control.  

  

  

 SECTION 1.03. Board Representation.   

 (a) Subject to applicable law, promptly upon the acceptance for payment of any Shares pursuant to the Offer, and from time to time thereafter as Shares are acquired pursuant to the Offer, Merger Subsidiary shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company as will give Merger Subsidiary representation on the Board of Directors of the Company equal to at least that number of directors on the Companys Board of Directors which equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of Directors (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant to this Section and including current directors serving as officers of the Company) multiplied by (ii) the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary (including Shares accepted for payment) bears to the number of Shares outstanding. The Company shall take all actions necessary to cause Merger Subsidiarys designees to be elected or appointed to the Companys Board of Directors, including increasing the size of the Board of Directors and/or securing the resignations of incumbent    ##### 

  

 

directors (including, if necessary, to ensure that a sufficient number
of independent directors are serving on the Board of Directors of the Company
in order to satisfy the Nasdaq National Market listing requirements). Subject
to applicable law and to the extent permitted by the Nasdaq National
Market listing requirements, the Company shall cause individuals designated
by Merger Subsidiary to constitute the same percentage as is on the entire
Board of Directors of the Company (after giving effect to this Section
1.03(a)) to be on (i) each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
and (ii) each Board of Directors and each committee thereof of each
Subsidiary of the Company. The Companys obligations to appoint designees to
its Board of Directors shall be subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of
the Exchange Act. At the request of Merger Subsidiary, the Company shall
promptly take, at its expense, all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f)
and Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act in order to fulfill its obligations
under this Section 1.03(a) and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 or
otherwise timely mail to its stockholders all necessary information to comply
therewith. Merger Subsidiary will supply to the Company, and be solely
responsible for, all information with respect to itself and its officers,
directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 under the
Exchange Act.   

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.03(a), following the election or appointment of Merger Subsidiarys designees pursuant to Section 1.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall at all times have at least three directors who are directors on the date hereof and who are not employed by the Company and who are not Affiliates, stockholders or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Independent Directors"); provided that if any Independent Directors cease to be directors for any reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Directors (or Independent Director, if there is only one remaining) shall be entitled to designate any other Person(s) who shall not be an Affiliate, stockholder or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Person(s) shall be deemed to be Independent Director(s) for purposes of this Agreement; provided that the remaining Independent Directors shall fill such vacancies as soon as practicable, but in any event within ten Business Days, and further provided that if no such Independent Director is appointed in such time period, Merger Subsidiary shall designate such Independent Director(s), provided further that if no Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate three Persons who shall not be Affiliates, stockholders or employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to fill such vacancies and such Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. In all cases, the selection of any Independent Directors who are not directors on the date hereof shall be subject to the approval of Merger Subsidiary, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.   

 (c) Following the election or appointment of Merger Subsidiarys designees pursuant to Section 1.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors and no other action on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by the Board of Directors of the Company, any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Subsidiary and any enforcement of or any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, any action to seek to enforce any obligations of Parent or Merger Subsidiary under this Agreement or any other action by the Companys Board of Directors under or in connection with this Agreement. The Independent Directors shall have full power solely with respect to the matters set forth in the previous sentence to be approved by the Independent Directors.  

  

  

 SECTION 1.04. Top-Up Option.   

 (a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Merger Subsidiary an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option") to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, a number of shares of    ##### 

  

 

Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Option Shares") that, when added to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Subsidiary at
the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share of Company
Common Stock more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares; provided that in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for
more than 2,596,237 shares of Company Common Stock. The Top-Up Option may be
exercised by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, in whole or in part, at any time on
or after the expiration date of the Offer and on or prior to the tenth
Business Day after the later of (i) the expiration date of the Offer or (ii)
the expiration of any Subsequent Period; provided, however, that the
obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise
of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (A) no provision of
any applicable law and no judgment, injunction, order or decree shall
prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up
Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (B) the issuance of Top-Up Option
Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option would not require approval of the
Companys stockholders under applicable law or regulation (including, without
limitation, Nasdaq National Market rules and regulations, including Section
4350(i)(1)(D)), (C) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of shares
of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Subsidiary constitutes one share of
Company Common Stock more than 90% of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares, and (D) Merger Subsidiary has accepted for payment and paid
for all Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn. The parties
shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is
accomplished consistent with all applicable legal requirements of any
Governmental Entity, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the "Securities
Act").   

 (b) In the event Parent or Merger Subsidiary wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent shall so notify the Company at least one Business Day in advance and shall set forth in such notice (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are expected to be owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) a place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Parent or Merger Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares upon issuance, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent or Merger Subsidiary a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares.   

 (c) Merger Subsidiary is, or will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Merger Subsidiary agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Subsidiary for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in connection with any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act. Certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares delivered hereunder may, at the Companys election, contain the following legend:    

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR ANY EXEMPTION THEREFROM."    #####

MERGER; CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

  

  

  

 SECTION 2.01. The Merger.   

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger, the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease.   

 (b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver (by the parties) of the conditions set forth in Article VI, the parties to this Agreement shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary of State") a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is required by and executed in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of Merger has been filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time as shall be agreed upon by Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the "Effective Time").   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that Merger Subsidiary shall acquire at least 90% of the outstanding Shares, Parent and the Company hereby agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective, without a meeting of the holders of Shares, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL as promptly as practicable.   

 (d) The Merger shall have the effects specified under the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. As of the Effective Time, the Company shall be a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.  

  

  

 SECTION 2.02. Certificate of Incorporation. Unless otherwise determined by Parent or Merger Subsidiary before the Effective Time, at the Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (the "Surviving Charter"), until amended as provided in the Surviving Charter or by applicable law.  

  

  

 SECTION 2.03. Bylaws. The Company shall take all requisite action so that the Bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the "Surviving Bylaws"), until amended in accordance with the Surviving Charter, the Surviving Bylaws or by applicable law.  

  

  

 SECTION 2.04. Directors and Officers.   

 (a) The Company shall take all requisite action so that the directors of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier death,    ##### 

  

 

resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Charter,
the Surviving Bylaws and the DGCL. If, at the Effective Time, a vacancy
shall exist on the Board of Directors or in any office of the Surviving
Corporation, such vacancy may thereafter be filled in the manner provided by
the Surviving Charter, the Surviving Bylaws and applicable law.   

 (b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Charter, the Surviving Bylaws and the DGCL.  

  

  

 SECTION 2.05. Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or (b) otherwise carry out the provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances in law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such action.  

  

  

 SECTION 2.06. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:    

 (a) each Share held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and each issued and outstanding Share owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other Subsidiary of Parent shall be cancelled automatically and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment or consideration shall be made with respect thereto;    

 (b) each issued and outstanding Share (other than (i) Shares referred to in Section 2.06(a) and (ii) Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Offer Price (the "Merger Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest; and    

 (c) each share of capital stock of Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.015 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.  

  

  

 SECTION 2.07. Surrender and Payment.   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of Merger Consideration upon surrender of certificates representing the Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent    ##### 

  

 

will enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent, and at such
times, and from time to time, as the Paying Agent requires funds to
make payment pursuant to Section 2.06(b), Parent shall deposit or cause to
be deposited with the Paying Agent cash in an aggregate amount necessary to
make the payments pursuant to Section 2.06(b) to holders of Shares (such
amounts being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Paying
Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that
such investments shall be (i) direct obligations of the United States of
America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United
States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and
interest, or (iii) commercial paper rated the highest quality by either
Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation; provided
further that no loss thereon or thereof shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Shares pursuant to Section 2.06(b). Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and
any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section 2.06(b) shall be
promptly paid to Parent. To the extent that there are losses with respect to
such investments or the funds available diminish for other reasons below the
level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration as
contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore funds to ensure
that the funds available are at a level sufficient to make payments.   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event no later than the fifth Business Day thereafter, to each person who was a record holder as of the Effective Time of an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the "Certificates"), and whose Shares were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.06(b), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as are reasonable and customary in transactions such as the Merger) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect of that Certificate, less any required withholding of Taxes, and such Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates.   

 (c) If payment is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.   

 (d) Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.07, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Shares owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other subsidiary of Parent, Shares held by the Company and Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes, from and after the Effective Time, only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration.   

 (e) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers of Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable law. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full    ##### 

  

 

satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares previously represented by
such Certificates. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, such Certificates
shall be cancelled and exchanged for cash as provided in this Article II. At
the close of business on the day of the Effective Time the stock ledger of
the Company shall be closed.   

 (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand. At any time more than nine months after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall upon demand of Parent deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed in exchange for Certificates (including all interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all such funds). Thereafter, holders of Certificates shall look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to the terms of this Agreement, abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be payable, without interest, upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Any amounts remaining unclaimed immediately prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat or become the property of any governmental unit or agency, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate of Shares to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.  

  

  

 SECTION 2.08. Company Stock Options.   

 (a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each outstanding option (whether or not then vested or exercisable) to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option") to be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash, without interest, in an amount (the "Option Consideration") determined by multiplying (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of such Option by (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock then covered by the Company Stock Option. The Option Consideration shall be payable by the Company to each holder of a Company Stock Option promptly after the Effective Time, subject to applicable withholding, and only after (i) verification by the Company and Parent of the ownership and terms of the particular Company Stock Option by reference to the Companys records, and (ii) delivery of a written instrument duly executed by the holder of the applicable Company Stock Option, in a form provided by the Company, and acceptable to Parent, setting forth (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable under the Company Stock Options owned by such holder and the respective issue dates and exercise prices of the Company Stock Options, (y) a representation by the holder that he or she is the owner of all Company Stock Options described pursuant to clause (x) and that none of those Company Stock Options has expired or ceased to be exercisable, and (z) a confirmation by such holder that the Company Stock Option is no longer in force or effect. Parent will provide funds to the Company sufficient to enable it to pay the Option Consideration. All unexercised Company Stock Options as of the Effective Time that have an exercise price equal to or exceeding the Merger Consideration shall be immediately cancelled and forfeited. Prior to the Effective Date, the Company shall make any amendments to the Companys 1993 Stock Incentive Plan, 2001 Stock Incentive Plan and Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "Company Option Plans") that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.08(a).   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors of Parent, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of the Company (if any) for purposes of Section 16 under the Exchange Act ("Section 16") of Shares or Company Stock Options pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.    ##### 

  

 

  

  

 SECTION 2.09. Dissenting Shares.   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are held by any record holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due in respect of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL; provided, however, that any holder of Dissenting Shares who shall have failed to perfect or shall have withdrawn or lost such holders rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, in each case under the DGCL, shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted into the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration without interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.09, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares shall cease. The Surviving Corporation shall comply with all of its obligations under the DGCL with respect to holders of Dissenting Shares.   

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal, any withdrawals of such demands received by the Company and any other related instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or negotiate, offer to settle or settle any such demands.  

  

  

 SECTION 2.10. Adjustments. If during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted.  

  

  

 SECTION 2.11. Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.  

  

  

 SECTION 2.12. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such affidavit claiming such Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article.    #####

 (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 35,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.015 per share ("Company Common Stock"), and (ii) 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.015 per share (the "Preferred Stock").

any waiver or release under any standstill or similar contract relating to
the Shares or the Company or its Subsidiaries to which it or any of

of Directors, acting in good faith and by a majority of the members of its
entire Board of Directors, has (A) determined, after consultation with its
financial advisor, that such waiver or release is reasonably likely to result

outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Board of Directors fiduciary
obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable laws; (iv)
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or (v) enter into any
agreement in principle, arrangement, understanding or contract for any
Acquisition Proposal.

take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the
Board of Directors fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable laws (in each case, taking into account any adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger offered
in writing by Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal), and (y) the
Company enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person, provided
that to the extent such Confidentiality Agreement is on terms and conditions
materially more favorable to such Person than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed
amended to contain such materially more favorable terms; and    

 (ii) subject to compliance with Section 5.03(d)(i), entering into a definitive agreement providing for the implementation of or approving, endorsing or recommending an Acquisition Proposal, and, in connection therewith, withdrawing its recommendation of the Offer and the Merger, but only so long as (A) the Board of Directors, acting in good faith and by a majority of the entire Board of Directors, has (1) approved such definitive agreement, (2) determined, after consultation with its financial advisor, that such bona fide written and unsolicited Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (3) determined, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Board of Directors fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable laws and (B) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to, and after complying with all of the provisions of, Section 7.01(f).   

 (e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives receives a request for information from a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal involving the Company and the Company is permitted to provide such Person with information pursuant to this Section 5.03, the Company will provide to Parent a copy of the confidentiality agreement with such Person promptly upon its execution and provide to Parent a list of, and copies of, the information provided to such Person promptly after its delivery to such Person and promptly provide Parent with access to all information to which such Person was provided access, in each case only to the extent copies were not previously provided to Parent.   

 (f) The Board of Directors of the Company shall not (i) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) enter into any agreement in principle or understanding or contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal, unless the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to, and after complying with all of the provisions of, Section 7.01(f).

the Company has Knowledge from any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) any Proceedings

to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
have been disclosed pursuant to Section 3.11 or which relate to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) any
fact or occurrence between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time
of which it has Knowledge which makes any of its representations contained in
this Agreement untrue in any material respect or causes any material breach
of its obligations under this Agreement.   

 (b) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall as promptly as reasonably practicable notify the Company of: (i) any notice or other communication of which the Parent has Knowledge from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person (or other Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) any notice or other communication of which the Parent has Knowledge from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) any Proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing which relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) any fact or occurrence between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time of which it becomes aware which makes any of its representations contained in this Agreement untrue in any material respect or causes any material breach of its obligations under this Agreement.

 SECTION 5.06. Director and Officer Liability. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted by law the present and former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries against all losses, claims, damages, fines, penalties and liability in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including amounts paid in settlement or compromise with the approval of the Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), provided that none of the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all indemnified parties in any single action except to the extent that, in the opinion of counsel for the indemnified parties, two or more of such indemnified parties have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action. Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current and former officers and directors of the Company as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or any agreement set forth in Schedule 5.06 of the Company Disclosure Letter, in each case in effect as of the date hereof, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their    ##### 

  

 

terms and without amendment thereof. For at least six years after
the Effective Time, the Parent will cause Merger Subsidiary to, and
Surviving Corporation will, without any lapse in coverage, provide officers
and directors liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time covering each such Person currently covered by
the Companys officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms
with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that if the aggregate
annual premiums for such insurance at any time during such period exceed 200%
of the per annum rate currently paid by the Company for such insurance on the
date of this Agreement (which premium the Company represents is $189,000),
then the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available at an annual premium equal to 200% of such per
annum rate as of the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that Parent
and the Surviving Corporation may purchase a six-year "tail" with respect to
the Companys existing current directors and officers liability insurance
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to those Persons who are currently (and any additional Persons who
prior to the Effective Time become) covered by the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and
amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof and provided by a carrier with a credit or insurance rating no less
favorable than the current carrier. If the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation, or such successor or assign, as the case may be, assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.06.  

  

  

 SECTION 5.07. Employee Benefits. From and after the Effective Time, employees of the Company who continue their employment with the Company (the "Continuing Employees") shall, at the option of Parent, either continue to be eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans that are, at the option of Parent, continued by the Company, or alternatively shall be eligible to participate in the same manner as similarly situated employees employed by Parent in the employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Parent, as applicable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall (to the extent permitted under the terms of Parents existing employee benefit plans), recognize the prior employment with the Company of each of the Continuing Employees in connection with all employee benefit plans of Parent in which employees Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time, for eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit plans). Nothing herein shall preclude Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from having the right to terminate the employment of any employee, with or without cause, or to amend or to terminate any employee benefit plan of Parent established, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its Affiliates after the Effective Time.  

  

  

 SECTION 5.08. Taxes. Except where the failure to do so can be cured with minimal cost and penalties to the Company and its Subsidiaries, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall:    

 (a) prepare, in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice (except as otherwise required by law), and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by it (or them) on or before the Effective Time;    

 (b) fully and timely pay all Taxes due and payable on or before the Effective Time;    

 (c) (i) properly reserve (and reflect such reserve in its books and records and financial statements), in accordance with past practice and in the ordinary course of business, for all Taxes that are not yet due and payable for all taxable periods, or portions thereof, ending on or    ##### 

  

   

before the Effective Time; (ii) promptly notify Parent of any Proceeding
pending against or with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
respect of any Tax matter, including Tax liabilities and refund claims, and
not settle or compromise any such Tax matter or Proceeding without Parents

 (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law; provided that subject to Section 7.02, if a Termination Fee is paid pursuant to Section 9.04, the payment thereof shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy hereunder.   

 SECTION 9.04. Fees and Expenses.

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(b) and at the time of such termination (x) the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied and (y) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been previously announced or made known to the Company or an offer commenced;    ##### 

  

 

and (2) $17.9 million (the "Termination Fee") if:   

 (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(e) or 7.01(f);   

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(y) or 7.01(i) and, prior to the one year anniversary of such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (I) consummates any Business Combination or (II) enters into any agreement in principle, arrangement, understanding or contract providing for the implementation of a Business Combination (other than a capital raising transaction by the Company in the form of an underwritten public offering) and shall consummate (whether before or after such one year anniversary) such Business Combination; or   

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(b) and at the time of such termination (w) the Minimum Condition has not been satisfied, (x) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal has been previously announced or made known to the Company or an offer commenced and, (y) prior to the one year anniversary of such termination, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (I) consummates any Acquisition Proposal regardless of whether or not such Acquisition Proposal was the same Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (x) or (II) enters into any agreement in principle, arrangement, understanding or contract providing for the implementation of any Acquisition Proposal (other than a capital raising transaction by the Company in the form of an underwritten public offering) regardless of whether or not such Acquisition Proposal was the same Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (x) and shall consummate (whether before or after such one year anniversary) such Acquisition Proposal.   

 (c) Any amounts payable pursuant to Sections 9.04(b)(1) and 9.04(b)(2)(i) shall be payable as promptly as practicable following termination of this Agreement (but no more than three Business Days) and, if the Company is the party seeking to terminate this Agreement, as a condition thereto. Any amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.04(b)(2)(ii) or (iii) shall be paid promptly but in no event later than three Business Days after the consummation of the applicable Business Combination or Acquisition Proposal, as the case may be.   

 (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Subsidiary would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay promptly any amounts due pursuant to this Section 9.04, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the fee or expense reimbursement set forth in this Section 9.04, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest from the date of termination of this Agreement on the amounts so owed at the prime rate as announced in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect from time to time during such period, plus 4%.   

 SECTION 9.05. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto (and which transfer shall not relieve Parent and Merger Subsidiary of their obligations hereunder in the event of a breach by their transferee).   

 SECTION 9.06. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW.    #####

ANNEX A    

 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall not be required to accept for payment or purchase or pay for any Shares, may postpone the acceptance for payment of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and may terminate the Offer (in each case in accordance with the Agreement), if (x) there shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of Shares that would, together with any other shares beneficially owned by Parent and Affiliates, constitute more than 50% of the voting power (determined on a fully diluted basis) on the date of purchase of all the securities of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors or in a merger (the "Minimum Condition"), (y) the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated by the expiration date of the Offer, or (z) if any of the following conditions shall occur and be continuing as of any scheduled expiration date of the Offer:   

 (a) there shall be enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or, pursuant to an authoritative interpretation by or on behalf of a Governmental Entity, deemed applicable to the Offer or the Merger any law or Order, other than the routine application of waiting period provisions of the HSR Act, that (i) makes illegal or otherwise directly or indirectly restrains or prohibits the making of the Offer, the acceptance for payment of or payment for some of or all the Shares by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or the consummation of the Merger, (ii) restrains or prohibits Parents ownership or operation (or that of its respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates) of all or any material portion of the business or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or compels Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of the business or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) imposes material limitations on the ability of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of Parents other Subsidiaries or Affiliates effectively to exercise full rights of ownership with respect to the Shares, including the right to vote any Shares acquired or owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of Parents other Subsidiaries or Affiliates on all matters properly presented to the Companys stockholders, (iv) requires divestiture by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of Parents other Subsidiaries or Affiliates of any Shares or (v) compels Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and/or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any material portion of (A) the business, assets or properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) the business, assets or properties of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or   

 (b) (x) there shall be instituted or pending any action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, to delay materially or otherwise directly or indirectly to restrain or prohibit the making of the Offer, the acceptance for payment of or payment for some of or all the Shares by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or the consummation of the Merger, (ii) seeking to obtain material damages or otherwise directly or indirectly relating to the transactions contemplated by the Offer or the Merger, (iii) seeking to restrain or prohibit Parents ownership or operation (or that of its respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates) of all or any material portion of the business or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iv) seeking to impose or confirm material limitations on the ability of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of Parents other Subsidiaries or Affiliates effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares, including the right to vote any Shares acquired or owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of Parents other Subsidiaries or Affiliates on all matters properly presented to the Companys stockholders, (v) seeking to require divestiture by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of Parents other Subsidiaries or Affiliates of any Shares, (vi) seeking to compel Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and/or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate any material portion of (A) the business, assets or properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) the business, assets or properties of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (vii) that otherwise has or would be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (y) any proposal by any Governmental Entity shall be made that, if enacted, would reasonably be expected to have the effects described in clause (x) above; or    ##### 

  

  

 (c) a judgment shall be entered by a Governmental Entity imposing damages on the Company and its Subsidiaries and/or Parent and its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, that has or would be reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect; or   

 (d) since December 31, 2003 there has been any event, occurrence or development or state of circumstances or facts which, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect; or   

 (e) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have failed to recommend, or shall have withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent, its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger, or shall have recommended, or entered into, or publicly announced its intention to enter into, an agreement or an agreement in principle with respect to a Superior Proposal (or shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing); or   

 (f) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct at and as of the expiration of the Offer as if made on such date (other than those representations and warranties that expressly address matters only as of a particular date that are true and correct as of such date), except (A) for changes expressly permitted by this Agreement or (B) where all such failures to be true and correct (without giving effect to any materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect, Knowledge or, in the case of Indebtedness, good faith estimate qualifiers set forth therein) could not reasonably be expected to (x) result in liabilities, losses, damages, claims or expenses that in the aggregate exceed $30,750,000, or (ii) the Company shall not have performed in any material respect its obligations, agreements and covenants to be performed by it under the Agreement; or   

 (g) there shall have occurred (i) any general suspension of, or limitation on prices for, trading in securities on any national securities exchange or Nasdaq for a continuous period of two days, (ii) a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States or Canada, (iii) any significant limitation (whether or not mandatory) by a Governmental Entity on the extension of credit by banks or other lending institutions, (iv) a commencement of a war or armed hostilities or other national calamity directly involving the United States or Canada and Parent shall have determined that there is a reasonable likelihood that such event would have a material adverse significance to Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Company and its Subsidiaries, (v) any decline of at least 15% in the Dow Jones Average of Industrial Stocks and 15% in the Standard and Poors 500 Index from the levels thereof as of the last trading day immediately preceding the date of this Agreement or (vi) in the case of any of the foregoing existing at the time of the execution of this Agreement, a material acceleration or worsening thereof; or   

 (h) any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their Affiliates, shall have acquired beneficial ownership (as determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 15% or more of the Shares;  

which, in the reasonable good faith judgment of Parent in any such case
of clauses (a) through (h), and regardless of the circumstances giving rise
to any such condition, makes it inadvisable to proceed with such acceptance
for payment or payment.   

 The foregoing conditions (other than the Minimum Condition) are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Subsidiary and may, except as provided otherwise in Section 1.01(a) of the    ##### 

  

 

Agreement, be waived by Parent and Merger Subsidiary in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time in their discretion. The failure by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right
with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a
waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances, and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.
