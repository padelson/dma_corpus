<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June&nbsp;9, 2004 (the &#147;Agreement&#148;),
by and among PETRO-CANADA (US)&nbsp;HOLDINGS LTD., a Delaware corporation
(&#147;Parent&#148;), RAVEN ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (&#147;Merger Subsidiary&#148;), and PRIMA ENERGY CORPORATION, a
Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;). Certain terms used in this Agreement are
used as defined in Article&nbsp;VIII.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and the Company have each approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Parent proposes to cause Merger Subsidiary to make a tender offer
to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$0.015 per share, of the Company (the &#147;Common Shares&#148;), including associated
rights (&#147;Rights&#148;) to purchase preferred shares issued pursuant to the Rights
Agreement (the Common Shares, together with the Rights, are hereinafter
referred to individually as a &#147;Share&#148; and collectively, the &#147;Shares&#148;), at a
price of $39.50 per Share (such amount, or any greater amount per Share paid
pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the &#147;Offer Price&#148;),
subject to any required withholding of Taxes, net to the seller in cash,
without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement (such tender offer, as it may be amended and supplemented from
time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the &#147;Offer&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, after acquiring the Shares pursuant to the Offer, Merger
Subsidiary will merge with and into the Company (the &#147;Merger&#148;), whereby each
issued and outstanding Share not owned directly or indirectly by Parent or the
Company, except as otherwise provided herein, will be converted into the right
to receive the Offer Price.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii)&nbsp;adopted resolutions
approving and declaring advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and (iii)&nbsp;subject to
the terms and conditions contained herein, agreed to recommend that the
stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares and, if
required by applicable law, adopt and approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, as an inducement to the Parent entering into this Agreement,
certain Persons in their capacities as stockholders of the Company are
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement entering into
agreements in substantially the form of Exhibit&nbsp;A hereto (the &#147;Stockholder
Agreements&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event no more than ten Business Days, after the date of
this Agreement, Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, commence, within the meaning of Rule
l4d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the
rules and regulations thereunder (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;)), the Offer. The
obligation of Merger Subsidiary to, and of Parent to cause Merger Subsidiary
to, accept for payment and pay for any Shares tendered shall be subject only to
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Annex A and to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. Parent and Merger Subsidiary expressly reserve
the right to waive any of the conditions to the Offer to the extent legally
permissible (other than the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex A), which
may not be waived without the prior written consent of the Company), to
increase the price per Share payable in the Offer and to make any other changes
in the terms and conditions of the Offer except that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, no change may be made to the Offer that would alter
form of consideration to be paid, no decrease in the Offer Price or the number
of Shares sought in the Offer may be made, no change which imposes additional
conditions to the Offer or modifies any of the conditions set forth in Annex A
in any manner adverse to the holders of the Shares may be made and neither
Parent nor Merger Subsidiary may extend the Offer, except in accordance with
Section&nbsp;1.01(c).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Subsidiary
shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule&nbsp;TO (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the
&#147;Schedule&nbsp;TO&#148;), which shall comply in all material respects with the provisions
of applicable federal securities laws, and shall contain (including as an
exhibit) or incorporate by reference the offer to purchase relating to the
Offer and forms of the related letter of transmittal and other appropriate
documents (which documents, as amended or supplemented from time to time, are
referred to herein collectively as the &#147;Offer Documents&#148;). The Parent and the
Merger Subsidiary further agree to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders
of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.
In conducting the Offer, the Parent and the Merger Subsidiary shall comply in
all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and any other
applicable laws necessary to be complied with in connection with the Offer.
The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Subsidiary all
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company&#146;s
stockholders that may be reasonably required or requested in connection with
any action contemplated by this Section&nbsp;1.01. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents prior to their filing with the SEC. Parent and Merger Subsidiary
agree to provide the Company, and to consult with the Company and its counsel
regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff (whether
written or oral) with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt
thereof and any responses thereto. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the
Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in
the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary further
agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each
case, as and to the extent required by law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Offer shall remain
open until midnight, New York City time, on the date that is 20 Business Days
after the date the Offer is commenced; provided, however, that without the
consent of the Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall have the right to
extend the Offer (i)&nbsp;from time to time if, at any scheduled expiration date of
the Offer, any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A shall not
have been satisfied or earlier waived, until such conditions are satisfied or
earlier waived; provided that if only the condition set forth in clause (y)&nbsp;of
the first sentence of Annex A hereto is not satisfied or earlier waived, Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall extend the Offer at the request of the Company (but
in no event shall Parent and Merger Subsidiary be obligated to extend
expiration of the Offer pursuant to this clause (i)&nbsp;beyond September&nbsp;30, 2004);
and provided further that Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall, upon the written
request of the Company, extend the Offer for one or more periods not to exceed
an aggregate of fifteen Business Days if, as of any expiration date, all of the
conditions set forth in clause (z)&nbsp;are not satisfied, but such conditions are

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">reasonably capable of being satisfied in such period, (ii)&nbsp;for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the
staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by applicable law,
(iii)&nbsp;on one or more occasions (all such occasions aggregating not more than
ten Business Days) beyond the latest expiration that would otherwise be
permitted under clause (i)&nbsp;or (ii)&nbsp;of this sentence, if, on such expiration
date, all of the conditions to Merger Subsidiary&#146;s obligations to accept for
payment Shares are satisfied or earlier waived, but the number of Shares
validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer, together with
Shares then owned by Parent, represents less than 90% of the outstanding Shares
on a fully diluted basis; provided, however, that Parent&#146;s decision to extend
the Offer in the case of this clause (iii)&nbsp;shall constitute a waiver of the
conditions set forth in clauses (d)&nbsp;and (f) (excluding any willful or
intentional breach of any material obligation of the Company) on Annex A and of
its right to terminate the Agreement under Sections&nbsp;7.01(b), (d), (k)&nbsp;or (l)
and (iv)&nbsp;for one or more subsequent offering periods of up to an additional 20
Business Days in the aggregate (collectively, the &#147;Subsequent Period&#148;) pursuant
to Rule&nbsp;14d-11 of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Subsidiary shall also have the right to extend the Offer in accordance
with Section&nbsp;7.01(f).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer and this Agreement,
Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to, accept
for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration thereof (but in any event
within three Business Days); provided that Merger Subsidiary shall immediately
accept and promptly pay for all Shares as they are tendered during any
Subsequent Period. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger
Subsidiary on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that
Merger Subsidiary becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and
represents and warrants that the Board of Directors of the Company, at a
meeting duly called and held prior to the date hereof, at which all of the
directors were present, has unanimously (i)&nbsp;determined that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders, (ii)&nbsp;adopted resolutions approving and adopting and declaring
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger, (iii)&nbsp;resolved to recommend that the stockholders of
the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares and, if required by
applicable law, adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, provided that such recommendation
may be withdrawn, modified or amended in accordance with the provisions of
Section&nbsp;5.03, (iv)&nbsp;acknowledged that such approval is effective for purposes of
Section&nbsp;203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#147;DGCL&#148;), (v)&nbsp;resolved
to elect, to the extent permitted by law, not to be subject to any
&#147;moratorium,&#148; &#147;control share acquisition,&#148; &#147;business combination,&#148; &#147;fair price&#148;
or other form of anti-takeover laws and regulations of any jurisdiction that

and (vi)&nbsp;irrevocably taken all necessary steps to render Section&nbsp;203 of the
DGCL inapplicable to the Merger, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the acquisition of

Stockholder Agreements. The Company further represents that Goldman, Sachs &#038;
Co. has delivered to the Board of Directors of the Company an opinion to the
effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, and subject to the limitations
and qualifications set forth therein, the consideration to be received by the
holders of Shares (other than Parent and Merger Subsidiary) in the Offer and
the Merger is fair from a financial point of view to such holders, and that the
Company will deliver to Parent and Merger Subsidiary a true and correct copy of
such opinion promptly after its receipt by the Company. The Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the
Board of Directors of the Company described in the first sentence of this

the Paying Agent in respect of all such funds). Thereafter, holders of
Certificates shall look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to the terms
of this Agreement, abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable, without interest, upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed immediately prior to such time when such
amounts would otherwise escheat or become the property of any governmental unit
or agency, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered in
respect of such Certificate of Shares to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause
each outstanding option (whether or not then vested or exercisable) to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a &#147;Company Stock Option&#148;) to be cancelled
and converted into the right to receive cash, without interest, in an amount
(the &#147;Option Consideration&#148;) determined by multiplying (x)&nbsp;the excess, if any,
of the Merger Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of
such Option by (y)&nbsp;the number of shares of Company Common Stock then covered by
the Company Stock Option. The Option Consideration shall be payable by the
Company to each holder of a Company Stock Option promptly after the Effective
Time, subject to applicable withholding, and only after (i)&nbsp;verification by the
Company and Parent of the ownership and terms of the particular Company Stock
Option by reference to the Company&#146;s records, and (ii)&nbsp;delivery of a written
instrument duly executed by the holder of the applicable Company Stock Option,
in a form provided by the Company, and acceptable to Parent, setting forth (x)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable under the
Company Stock Options owned by such holder and the respective issue dates and
exercise prices of the Company Stock Options, (y)&nbsp;a representation by the
holder that he or she is the owner of all Company Stock Options described
pursuant to clause (x)&nbsp;and that none of those Company Stock Options has expired
or ceased to be exercisable, and (z)&nbsp;a confirmation by such holder that the
Company Stock Option is no longer in force or effect. Parent will provide
funds to the Company sufficient to enable it to pay the Option Consideration.
All unexercised Company Stock Options as of the Effective Time that have an
exercise price equal to or exceeding the Merger Consideration shall be
immediately cancelled and forfeited. Prior to the Effective Date, the Company
shall make any amendments to the Company&#146;s 1993 Stock Incentive Plan, 2001
Stock Incentive Plan and Non-Employee Directors&#146; Stock Option Plan
(collectively, the &#147;Company Option Plans&#148;) that are necessary to give effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Section&nbsp;2.08(a).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors of Parent, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person
of the Company (if any) for purposes of Section&nbsp;16 under the Exchange Act
(&#147;Section&nbsp;16&#148;) of Shares or Company Stock Options pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section&nbsp;16.

converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but shall become
the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due in

any holder of Dissenting Shares who shall have failed to perfect or shall have
withdrawn or lost such holder&#146;s rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares,
in each case under the DGCL, shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares, and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been

contained in this Section&nbsp;2.09, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then
the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholder&#146;s
Dissenting Shares shall cease. The Surviving Corporation shall comply with all

pursuant to this Article such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal,

maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules
13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and

effective in alerting in a timely fashion the Company&#146;s principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer to material information required to
be included in the Company&#146;s periodic reports required under the Exchange Act
and effectively enable the Company&#146;s principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer to make all certifications required under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

any amounts due pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9.04, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the
Company for the fee or expense reimbursement set forth in this Section&nbsp;9.04,
the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys&#146;
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest from
the date of termination of this Agreement on the amounts so owed at the prime
rate as announced in <I>The Wall Street Journal </I>in effect from time to time during

relieve Parent and Merger Subsidiary of their obligations hereunder in the
event of a breach by their transferee).
