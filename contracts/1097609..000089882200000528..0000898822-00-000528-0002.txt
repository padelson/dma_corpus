10    3     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER, dated as of July 23, 2000, between Deutsche Telekom AG, an
AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT organized and existing under the laws of the Federal
Republic of Germany ("DT"), and Voicestream Wireless Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("VOICESTREAM") (each a "PARTY" and, together, the
"PARTIES").   WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS, the Management Board (VORSTAND) and
the Supervisory Board (AUFSICHTSRAT) of DT and the Board of Directors of
Voicestream have determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
their respective companies and stockholders to consummate the strategic
combination transaction provided for in this Agreement, the stock
subscription contemplated by the DT Financing Agreements (as defined below)
and the other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the laws of
their respective jurisdictions of organization and have authorized the
execution and delivery of this Agreement;   WHEREAS, simultaneously with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, as part of a single overall
transaction, and to induce DT to enter into this Agreement, certain
stockholders of Voicestream are each entering into a Stockholders Agreement
(collectively, the "STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENTS") with DT dated the date hereof
with respect to this Agreement and the Merger (as defined below);  
WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as
part of a single overall transaction, and to induce Voicestream to enter into
this Agreement, DT is entering into the DT Financing Agreements as defined
below with Voicestream in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C;   WHEREAS,
for United States federal income tax purposes the parties intend that the
Merger will qualify (i) as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code (as defined below) and (ii) for an exception to the
general rule of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code; and   WHEREAS, DT and
Voicestream desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and
the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein
contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, DT and Voicestream
hereby agree as follows:   ARTICLE 1   THE MERGER   Section 1.01.
Appointment of Escrow Agent and Formation of Merger Sub. (a) Within ten (10)
Business Days following the execution of this agreement, DT shall cause
to      be incorporated pursuant to Delaware Law, a corporation which
shall be a constituent company in the Merger ("MERGER SUB"). DT shall own 100
percent of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub.   (b) As promptly
as possible following the date hereof, DT shall appoint a United States bank
or trust company or other independent financial institution in the United
States reasonably satisfactory to Voicestream to act, inter alia, as escrow
agent and exchange agent for the Merger and the delivery of the Merger
Consideration (as defined below) to former stockholders of Voicestream and
the other Merger Consideration Recipients (as defined below) (the "ESCROW
AGENT"). DT and Voicestream shall enter into an Escrow Agency Agreement with
the Escrow Agent based on the form attached hereto as Exhibit F but with such
changes as Voicestream and DT may agree (the "ESCROW AGENCY AGREEMENT"),
which agreement shall set forth the duties, responsibilities and obligations
of the Escrow Agent consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Solely to
accommodate the transactions described in this Article I and subject to the
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agency Agreement, one day prior to
the Effective Time DT shall cause the Escrow Agent to be registered, as
DT\'s fiduciary (for the period prior to the Effective Time) as the record
holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$.000001 per share, of Merger Sub (the "MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK").  
SECTION 1.02. The Merger. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and in accordance with Delaware Law, on the Closing Date (as
defined below), Voicestream will cause a certificate of merger (the
"CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by
applicable law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as
is specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with Delaware Law
(the "EFFECTIVE TIME").   (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into Voicestream in accordance with Delaware Law (the
"MERGER"), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and
Voicestream shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware, and the separate corporate existence of Voicestream, with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue
unaffected by the Merger except as set forth in this Article I. The Merger
shall have the effects specified in Delaware Law.   SECTION 1.03. The
Closing. On the fifth Business Day (or such other date as Voicestream and DT
may agree) after the last to be fulfilled or waived of the conditions set
forth in Article VI hereof (other than the conditions contained in Sections
6.02(c), 6.02(d) and 6.03(c) so long as it is reasonably apparent that such
conditions and the condition contained in Section 6.01(b) will be able to be
satisfied at the Closing) shall be fulfilled or waived in accordance with
this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall be held (but
only if all of the conditions set forth in Article VI shall have been
satisfied or waived prior to the Effective Time) at such time as DT and
Voicestream shall agree (the "CLOSING DATE") at the offices of Cleary,   
2    Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton, New York, New York or at such other place
or places as DT and Voicestream may agree.   SECTION 1.04. The Merger
Exchange.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agency Agreement, as soon as possible after
the Effective Time, (x) on the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall
contribute, for the account of the former stockholders of Voicestream, all of
the issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation Common Stock
(as defined below) to DT as a transfer in kind, and (y) DT shall deliver the
Merger Consideration to the Escrow Agent for the account of (i) the former
stockholders of Voicestream, (ii) the Dissenting Stockholders Trustee (as
defined in Annex 1.08(a) below), (iii) the Options Trustee (as defined in
Annex 1.08(a) below), (iv) the 7% Convertible Preferred Shares Trustee (as
defined in Annex 1.05(n)(2) below), (v) the Cook Inlet Partners Trustee (as
defined in Annex 1.05(p) below), (vi) the Restricted Shares Trustee (as
defined in Annex 1.08(b) below) and (vii) the Warrants Trustee (as defined in
Annex 1.05(o)) (collectively, the "MERGER CONSIDERATION RECIPIENTS"). DT and
the Escrow Agent shall effect the foregoing in accordance with Sections 183
et seq. and 203 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (AKTIENGESETZ)
(the "GERMAN ACT") by registering the increase of the DT stated share capital
with the commercial register (HANDELSREGISTER) for DT (the "COMMERCIAL
REGISTER") as soon as possible after the Effective Time. In the event that,
in connection with the performance of DT\'s obligations in this Section
1.04(a), on or prior to the Closing Date the Management Board of DT passes a
resolution to increase the issued capital of DT in accordance with Article
5(2) of the Articles of Association of DT by such number of shares as
is equal to the number of shares to be delivered as part of the
Merger Consideration, and the Supervisory Board shall have consented thereto,
then (i) the Escrow Agent shall promptly subscribe for such new DT Ordinary
Shares to be issued as part of the Merger Consideration and shall promptly on
the Closing Date make the contribution to DT referred to in the first
sentence of this Section 1.04(a) and (ii) the Management Board and the
chairman of the Supervisory Board shall as soon as possible thereafter file
the application for registration of the implementation of the capital
increase with the Commercial Register, with the effect that on registration
of the capital increase in the Commercial Register, such new DT Ordinary
Shares shall by operation of law be held solely by the Escrow Agent, for
delivery to and for the benefit of the Merger Consideration Recipients. Prior
to, and or immediately after or at the Effective Time, DT shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Escrow Agent for the benefit of holders of
Voicestream Common Shares in accordance with this Article I, the Aggregate
Cash Amount, or, if applicable, the Adjusted Aggregate Cash Amount. At the
Effective Time, the obligations of DT and the Escrow Agent under this Section
1.04(a) shall be unconditional.   (b) Each share certificate (a
"CERTIFICATE") formerly representing any Voicestream Common Shares (other
than Excluded Voicestream Shares (as defined below) and Dissenting Shares (as
defined below)) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section
1.09 cash in lieu of fractional DT Depositary Shares or fractional DT
Ordinary Shares, as applicable, and any dividend or distribution pursuant to
Section 1.06(f), in each case, without interest. The DT Ordinary Shares and
the DT Depositary Shares issued as provided in Section 1.05 shall be of
the    3    same class and shall have the same rights as the currently
outstanding DT Ordinary Shares and the currently outstanding DT Depositary
Shares, respectively.   SECTION 1.05. Conversion and Exchange of Shares. At
the Effective Time:   (a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of Voicestream ("VOICESTREAM COMMON SHARES") owned by DT or
Voicestream immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an "EXCLUDED
VOICESTREAM SHARE") shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, no longer be outstanding, be canceled and
retired without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist.   (b) Subject to the further provisions of this Section 1.05, each
Voicestream Common Share, other than Excluded Voicestream Shares
and Dissenting Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive: (i) for
each Voicestream Common Share in respect of which an effective Election shall
have been made, one of the following: (A) a combination of $30 in cash (the
"PER SHARE CASH AMOUNT") and 3.2 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
ordinary shares of DT ("DT ORDINARY SHARES"), subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 1.05(g) (the "MIXED CONSIDERATION"), (B) $200.00 in cash
(the "CASH CONSIDERATION"), subject to proration and/or adjustment as
provided in Sections 1.05(e) and (g) or (C) 3.7647 DT Ordinary Shares (the
"EXCHANGE RATIO"), subject to proration and/or adjustment as provided in
Sections 1.05(f) and (g) (the "STOCK CONSIDERATION") and (ii) for each
Voicestream Common Share in respect of which no effective Election has been
made for any reason, the Mixed Consideration. The consideration payable
pursuant to this paragraph (b) is referred to herein collectively as the
"MERGER CONSIDERATION".   (c) For purposes of this Section 1.05, "AGGREGATE
CASH AMOUNT" shall equal the product of (1) the Per Share Cash Amount and (2)
the total number of Voicestream Common Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time.   (d) Mixed Election. Each record holder of
Voicestream Common Shares immediately prior to the Election Deadline who
validly makes or is deemed to have made below a mixed election (a "MIXED
ELECTION") shall be entitled to receive the Mixed Consideration for each of
such holder\'s Voicestream Common Shares as to which such Mixed Election is
made. Mixed Elections shall be made on a form, mutually acceptable to DT and
Voicestream, designed for the purpose of making Elections (a "FORM ELECTION")
accompanied by Certificates for the Voicestream Common Shares to which such
Form of Election relates as provided in Section 1.05(h) below.   (e) Cash
Election. Each record holder of Voicestream Common Shares immediately prior
to the Election Deadline who validly makes a cash election (a "CASH
ELECTION") shall be entitled to receive cash or a combination of cash and DT
Ordinary Shares, solely as provided in clause (i) or (ii) below:   (i) If
(A) the product of the number of Voicestream Common  Shares as to which a
valid Cash Election is made and the Cash  Consideration (such product being
the    4     "CASH ELECTION AMOUNT") exceeds (B) the Aggregate Cash
Amount minus the  product of the Per Share Cash Amount and the number of
Voicestream  Common Shares as to which a valid Mixed Election (including No
Election  Shares) has been made (the amount determined pursuant to this
clause  (B) being the "AVAILABLE CASH ELECTION AMOUNT"), then each
Voicestream  Common Share as to which a valid Cash Election is made shall
be  converted into the right to receive (x) an amount of cash (without 
interest) equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by a fraction, the 
numerator of which shall be the Available Cash Election Amount and the 
denominator of which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction  being
the "CASH FRACTION") and (y) a number of DT Ordinary Shares equal  to the
product of (p) the Exchange Ratio and (q) a fraction equal to  one minus the
Cash Fraction.   (ii) If the Available Cash Election Amount equals or
exceeds  the Cash Election Amount, each Voicestream Common Share as to which
a  valid Cash Election is made shall be converted into the right to  receive
the Cash Consideration in cash (without interest).  Cash Elections shall be
made on the Form of Election, accompanied by Certificates for the Voicestream
Common Shares to which such Form of Cash Election relates as provided in
Section 1.05(h) below.   (f) Stock Election. Each record holder of
Voicestream Common Shares immediately prior to the Election Deadline who
validly makes a stock election (a "STOCK ELECTION") shall be entitled to
receive DT Ordinary Shares or a combination of cash and DT Ordinary Shares,
solely as provided in clause (i) or (ii) below:   (i) If the Available Cash
Election Amount exceeds the Cash  Election Amount, then each Voicestream
Common Share as to which a valid  Stock Election is made shall be converted
into the right to receive (A)  an amount of cash (without interest) equal to
the amount of such excess  divided by the number of Voicestream Common Shares
as to which a valid  Stock Election is made and (B) a number of DT Ordinary
Shares equal to  the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction,
the numerator  of which shall be $200 minus the amount calculated in clause
(A) of  this paragraph and the denominator of which shall be $200.   (ii)
If the Cash Election Amount equals or exceeds the  Available Cash Election
Amount, each Voicestream Common Share as to  which a valid Stock Election is
made shall be converted into the right  to receive the number of DT Ordinary
Shares equal to the Exchange  Ratio.   (g) Further Adjustments. (i) If
necessary to permit the delivery of the tax opinion referred to in Section
6.02(d), in addition to the adjustments set forth above, Voicestream shall,
after consultation with DT, prior to the delivery of the tax opinion referred
to in Section 6.02(d), reduce (a "CASH ADJUSTMENT") the Aggregate Cash Amount
to such amount (the "ADJUSTED AGGREGATE CASH AMOUNT") as Voicestream
reasonably determines is necessary to permit the delivery of the tax opinion
referred to in Section 6.02(d) and, if Voicestream makes a Cash   
5    Adjustment, DT shall substitute in lieu of such cash DT Common Shares
as set forth in this Section 1.05(g). On the date that is the fifth Business
Day (the "DETERMINATION DATE") prior to the expected Closing Date first
scheduled in accordance with Section 1.03, Voicestream shall reasonably
determine, in consultation with DT, based on information available as of such
date, whether a Cash Adjustment should be made, and if so, shall estimate the
Adjusted Aggregate Cash Amount. Such estimated Adjusted Aggregate Cash Amount
may, in Voicestream\'s reasonable discretion, after consultation with DT, be
conservatively estimated so as to facilitate the delivery of the tax opinion
referred to in Section 6.02(d) on the previously scheduled Closing Date based
on such estimated Adjusted Aggregate Cash Amount.   If a Cash Adjustment is
made after the Determination Date, the Effective Time and the Closing Date
shall be postponed by the minimum number of days, if any (but not to exceed
five (5) Business Days with respect to any single postponement), that
Voicestream reasonably determines, in consultation with DT, is necessary for
such adjustments to be properly made, and the Adjusted Aggregate Cash Amount
may, in Voicestream\'s reasonable discretion, after consultation with DT, be
conservatively estimated so as to facilitate the delivery of the tax opinion
referred to in Section 6.02(d) on the postponed Closing Date based on such
Adjusted Aggregate Cash Amount. The Adjusted Aggregate Cash Amount divided by
the Aggregate Cash Amount shall be referred to herein as the "ADJUSTMENT
FACTOR".   (ii) In the event the Aggregate Cash Amount is adjusted pursuant
to the first sentence of Section 1.05(g)(i), then the amount of cash that
would otherwise be payable in respect of a Voicestream Common Share subject
to a Cash Election, a Stock Election or a Mixed Election (respectively, a
"CASH ELECTION BASE AMOUNT", "STOCK ELECTION BASE AMOUNT" or "MIXED
ELECTION BASE AMOUNT", and each, a "BASE AMOUNT"), shall be reduced by the
difference (respectively, the "CASH ELECTION DIFFERENCE", the "STOCK ELECTION
DIFFERENCE" and the "MIXED ELECTION DIFFERENCE", and each, an "ELECTION
DIFFERENCE") between such Base Amount and the product of such Base Amount and
the Adjustment Factor. In substitution for the reduction of the cash portion
of the Merger Consideration resulting from the Election Difference,   1)
each share with respect to which a Cash Election shall have  been made shall
also receive a number of DT Ordinary Shares equal to  the Cash Election
Difference dividend by the DT Share Price;   2) each share with respect to
which a Stock Election shall  have been made shall also receive a number of
DT Ordinary Shares equal  to the Stock Election Difference divided by the DT
Share Price;   3) each share with respect to which a Mixed Election shall 
have been made shall also receive a number of DT Ordinary Shares equal  to
the Mixed Election Difference divided by the DT Share Price.   (iii) The
term "DT SHARE PRICE" means the average (rounded to the nearest 1/10,000) of
the DT Daily Prices for the seven (7) Frankfurt Stock Exchange ("FSE")
trading days randomly selected by lot by DT and Voicestream together from the
fifteen consecutive FSE trading days ending on the day prior to the day on
which the relevant Cash    6    Adjustment is made, and the term "DT
DAILY PRICE" for any trading day means the volume weighted average (rounded
to the nearest 1/10,000) of the per share trading prices of DT Ordinary
Shares on the FSE (in Euros, as reported by the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
Xetra trading system (or such other source as Voicestream and DT shall agree
in writing) on such FSE trading day, converted into U.S. Dollars at a fixed
exchange rate of 0.9216 Euros to a U.S. Dollar; provided, that if, prior to
such conversion the DT Share Price would be less than 33 Euros, then the DT
Share Price shall be deemed to be 33 Euros.   (h) Form of Election. To be
effective, an Election Form must be properly completed and signed, and must
be received by the Escrow Agent, accompanied by the Certificates as to which
the election is being made in compliance with the requirements for surrender
of Voicestream Common Shares contained in Section 1.06(a) below by the
Election Deadline. DT shall have the discretion, which it may delegate in
whole or in part to the Escrow Agent, to determine whether Election Forms
have been properly completed, signed, submitted and revoked and to disregard
immaterial defects in Election Forms. The decision of DT (or the Escrow
Agent) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding. DT and the Escrow
Agent shall make reasonable efforts to notify any Person of any defect in an
Election Form submitted to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall also make
all computations contemplated by this Section 1.05(h), and, absent manifest
error, all such computations shall be conclusive and binding on the holders
of Voicestream Common Shares. If DT or the Escrow Agent shall determine that
any purported Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election (any of
such elections, an "ELECTION") was not properly made, the Voicestream Common
Shares subject to such improperly made Election shall be treated as No
Election Shares. Each Voicestream Common Share as to which neither a valid
Mixed Election, a valid Cash Election nor a valid Stock Election is made,
including, without limitation, Voicestream Common Shares issued on exercise,
conversion or exchange of outstanding options, warrants, rights or
convertible or exchangeable securities after the Election Deadline (as
defined below) ("NO ELECTION SHARES"), shall be deemed to have made a valid
Mixed Election. A record holder need not make the same election with respect
to all of the Voicestream Common Shares held of record by such holder or
represented by a single Certificate.   (i) Election Deadline. DT and
Voicestream shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause copies of the
Election Forms and the Letter of Transmittal to be mailed to the record
holders of Voicestream Common Shares not less than forty five (45) days prior
to the anticipated Effective Time and to make the Election Forms available
promptly to all Persons who become record holders of Voicestream Common
Shares subsequent to the date of such mailing and no later than the close of
business on the second Business Day prior to the Election Deadline. An
Election Form must be received by the Escrow Agent by 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the date (the "ELECTION DEADLINE") that is the fifth Business
Day prior to the first Closing Date scheduled by the parties in accordance
with Section 1.03. All elections may be revoked until the Election Deadline
in writing by the record holders submitting the Election Forms. DT
and Voicestream shall use reasonable efforts to cause a public announcement
of the actual Election Deadline not fewer than five Business Days prior to
the Election Deadline.   (j) Form of Stock Consideration. Any DT Ordinary
Shares constituting a portion of the Merger Consideration shall be delivered
to the holders of Voicestream Common Shares in    7    the form of
American depositary shares, each representing the right to receive one DT
Ordinary Share (the "DT DEPOSITARY SHARES"). The DT Depositary Shares may be
evidenced by one or more receipts ("DT ADRS") issued in accordance with
the Deposit Agreement, dated as of November 18, 1996, as amended, among DT,
Citibank N.A., as Depositary (the "DEPOSITARY"), and the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of DT ADRs, as it may be further amended
from time to time (the "DEPOSIT AGREEMENT"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each Person who is entitled to receive DT Ordinary Shares as Merger
Consideration shall be entitled, with respect to all or any portion of his
Voicestream Common Shares, to make an unconditional and irrevocable election
(the "ORDINARY SHARE ELECTION") to receive DT Ordinary Shares in lieu of DT
Depositary Shares. The Election Forms and the Letter of Transmittal shall
contain a form of Ordinary Share Election and shall be used by each holder of
Voicestream Common Shares who wishes to make an Ordinary Share Election.  
(k) Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock, issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, no longer be outstanding, be
cancelled and retired. Immediately following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall issue to the Escrow Agent a number of shares
of Common Stock par value $0.000001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation ("SURVIVING CORPORATION COMMON STOCK") equal to the total number
of Voicestream Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Merger in
consideration of the payment by the Escrow Agent to the Surviving Corporation
of an amount equal to the product of the number of Surviving Corporation
Common Shares and the par value of such shares.   (l) In consideration of
the contribution to DT by the Escrow Agent of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock pursuant to Section 1.04(a) hereof, DT shall issue, in accordance with
Section 1.04(a), and deliver to the Escrow Agent, the maximum number of DT
Ordinary Shares (including DT Ordinary Shares underlying DT Depositary Shares
that are to be delivered as part of the Merger Consideration) that has become
payable pursuant to Section 1.05 for delivery to the Merger Consideration
Recipients entitled thereto and shall pay to the Escrow Agent the Aggregate
Cash Amount (or, if applicable, the Adjusted Aggregate Cash Amount) that has
become payable to the Merger Consideration Recipients pursuant to Section
1.05.   (m) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
all of the outstanding DT Ordinary Shares, or more than 80% of
the outstanding DT Ordinary Shares pursuant to an exchange offer for all
outstanding shares, shall have been changed into or exchanged for a different
number of shares or kind of shares of DT or another corporation or entity
owning more than 80% of the DT Ordinary Shares, or the DT Ordinary Shares
outstanding shall have changed, by reason of any reclassification, split-up,
stock-split, reverse stock-split, stock dividend, stock combination,
recapitalization or redenomination of share capital, merger or similar
statutory procedure or pursuant to an exchange offer, or DT changes the
number of DT Ordinary Shares represented by a DT Depositary Share, then the
Exchange Ratio and/or the amount or form of any portion of the Merger
Consideration that would otherwise be payable in DT Common Shares and the
issuer thereof and other definitions and provisions of this Agreement
dependent thereon or on the market price therefor, shall be appropriately
adjusted.     8     (n) Preferred Stock. (1) Not later than the third
Business Day preceding the record date for the Voicestream Stockholders\'
Meeting, each share of 2 1/2% Convertible Junior Preferred Stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Voicestream (the "2 1/2% CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES")
shall be converted, in accordance with paragraphs (i)(i) and (i)(vii) of
Section 1 of the Certificate of Designation of the 2 1/2% Convertible
Preferred Shares and the provisions of the relevant Stockholders Agreement,
into Voicestream Common Shares at the Conversion Rate (as such term is
defined in the 2 1/2% Convertible Preferred Shares Certificate of
Designation) in effect on the Conversion Date (as such term is defined in the
2 1/2% Convertible Preferred Shares Certificate of Designation).   (2) (A)
If the Effective Time does not occur prior to May 1, 2001, at any time on or
after May 1, 2001 until the Effective Time, DT may, in its sole discretion by
giving ten (10) Business Days prior written notice to Voicestream, but only
if permissible at such time under the terms of any indebtedness of
Voicestream or any of its Significant Subsidiaries existing on the date
hereof (including its credit agreement), require Voicestream to (or to cause
Omnipoint Corporation to) issue a notice of redemption (the "REDEMPTION")
with respect to all shares of Omnipoint Corporation 7% Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "7% CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED
SHARES"), in accordance with Sections 5.1(b) and 5.3 of the Certificate of
Designation of the 7% Convertible Preferred Shares, at the Redemption Price
(as such term is defined in the 7% Convertible Preferred Shares Certificate
of Designation) in effect on the Redemption Date (as such term is defined in
the 7% Convertible Preferred Shares Certificate of Designation), which
Redemption Price shall be equal to the appropriate Redemption Price per share
set forth in Section 5.1(b) of the Certificate of Designation of the 7%
Convertible Preferred Shares, plus in each case all accrued and unpaid
dividends on such 7% Convertible Preferred Shares (other than previously
declared dividends payable to the holder of record on a prior date) through
and including the Redemption Date, whether or not declared, which shall be
due and payable only in cash out of funds of Voicestream or
Omnipoint Corporation legally available for the payment of dividends, as more
fully provided in the 7% Convertible Preferred Shares Certificate of
Designation.   (B) If all the 7% Convertible Preferred Shares have not been
redeemed pursuant to paragraph (A) of this Section 1.05(n)(2) prior to the
Effective Time and upon conversion of any outstanding shares of
7% Convertible Preferred Shares after the Effective Time, the holders
thereof become entitled to DT Ordinary Shares, such DT Ordinary Shares to
which such holder of 7% Convertible Preferred Shares is entitled will be
issued from the 7% Convertible Preferred Shares Trust described in Annex
1.05(m)(2) (the "7% CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES TRUST"), and to the extent
holders of 7% Convertible Preferred Shares become entitled to cash payment
after the Effective Time, such cash payment to which such holder of 7%
Convertible Preferred Shares is entitled will be paid by DT.   (3) Any
shares of Convertible Voting Preferred Stock held by DT ("DT PREFERRED
SHARES") and any Voicestream 7% Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding at
the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and shall be unaffected by the
Merger.   (o) Warrants. If all the warrants granted pursuant to
the Omnipoint Corporation Remainder Warrant Certificate dated May 6, 1997
(the "WARRANTS") shall not have been    9    exercised prior to the
Effective Time and any holder of such Warrants becomes entitled to DT
Ordinary Shares after the Effective Time, such DT Ordinary Shares to which
such holder of Warrants is entitled will be issued from the Warrants Trust
described in Annex 1.05(o) (the "WARRANTS TRUST"), and to the extent
any holder of Warrants become entitled to cash payment after the Effective
Time, such cash payment to which such holder of Warrants is entitled will be
paid by DT.   (p) Cook Inlet and Cook Inlet Joint Venture Partners.   (i)
To the extent that prior to the Effective Time any of the  Cook Inlet
Partners receives Voicestream Common Shares in respect of  its rights to
exchange its interest in any of the Cook Inlet Joint  Ventures or Affiliates
of such joint ventures (the "COOK INLET EXCHANGE  RIGHTS"), such Cook Inlet
Partner shall have all the rights with  respect to such Voicestream Common
Shares which a Voicestream  stockholder has.   (ii) To the extent that any
of the Cook Inlet Partners does  not receive Voicestream Common Shares prior
to the Effective Time in  respect of its Cook Inlet Exchange Rights, each
Cook Inlet Partner  shall be entitled to receive the consideration that such
Cook Inlet  Partner is entitled to receive pursuant to the Cook Inlet
Exchange  Rights. To the extent that, on or after the Effective Time, a
Cook  Inlet Partner is entitled to DT Ordinary Shares, such shares will be 
delivered from the Cook Inlet Partners Trust described in Annex  1.05(p),
which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory  to DT and
Voicestream and to the extent that such Cook Inlet Partner is  entitled to
cash, such cash shall be paid by DT. The consideration  payable to a Cook
Inlet Partner pursuant to this clause (ii) shall not  constitute Merger
Consideration for the purpose of this Agreement.   (iii) After the date
hereof, Voicestream shall use reasonable  efforts to obtain the agreement of
SSPCS Corporation to enter into an  agreement relating to its Cook Inlet
Exchange Rights in a form  substantially similar to the agreement relating to
such matters entered  into by Cook Inlet on the date hereof.   SECTION
1.06. Surrender and Payment. (a) Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation will send, or will cause the Escrow Agent to send, to
each holder of record as of the Effective Time of Voicestream Common Shares
(other than holders of Excluded Voicestream Shares and Dissenting Shares and
holders of Voicestream Common Shares who made a valid Election with respect
to all their shares), a letter of transmittal which shall specify that the
delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of a Certificate to the Escrow Agent,
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender to the Escrow Agent
of Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (the "LETTER
OF TRANSMITTAL"). The Letter of Transmittal shall contain such other terms
and conditions as DT and Voicestream may reasonably specify.   (b) Each
record holder of any Voicestream Common Shares that have been converted into
a right to receive the consideration set forth in Section 1.05(b) shall, upon
surrender to the Escrow Agent of a Certificate or Certificates, together with
a properly completed    10    Letter of Transmittal covering the
Voicestream Common Shares represented by such Certificate or Certificates,
without further action, be entitled to receive, and the Escrow Agent shall
deliver (and DT shall cause the Escrow Agent to deliver) to each such holder,
subject to Section 1.06(e) below, (i) the number of whole DT Depositary
Shares or DT Ordinary Shares included in the Merger Consideration in respect
of such Voicestream Common Shares, subject to the provisions of Section 1.05,
and (ii) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings) of (A) the cash consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 1.05, plus (B) any cash in lieu of Fractional
Interests to be paid pursuant to Section 1.09, plus (C) any cash dividends or
other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 1.06(f). Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the
Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
number of whole DT Depositary Shares or DT Ordinary Shares, as applicable, to
which it is entitled pursuant to Section 1.05 and the applicable amounts
of cash provided in the foregoing clause (ii) of the preceding sentence.  
(c) If any DT Depositary Shares or DT Ordinary Shares are to be delivered to
a Person (as defined below) other than the registered holder of the
Voicestream Common Shares represented by a Certificate or
Certificates surrendered with respect thereto, it shall be a condition to
such issuance that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such delivery shall pay to the Escrow Agent any transfer or
other taxes required as a result of such delivery to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Voicestream Common Shares or establish to the
satisfaction of the Escrow Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.   (d) The stock transfer books of Voicestream shall be
closed after the close of trading on the NASDAQ on the Trading Day
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Voicestream Common Shares that were
outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time,
Certificates presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be
canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth, in this Article I.   (e) Any DT Ordinary
Shares issued and delivered in respect of Voicestream Common Shares pursuant
to this Article I, any cash entitled to be received therefor pursuant to
Section 1.05, and any cash in lieu of Fractional Interests to be paid
pursuant to Section 1.09, plus any cash dividend or other distribution that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.06(f) that remains
unclaimed by any holder of Voicestream Common Shares six months after the
Effective Time, shall be held by the Escrow Agent (or a successor agent
appointed by DT) or shall be delivered to the Depositary upon the instruction
of DT and held by the Depositary, in either case subject to the instruction
of DT, in an account or accounts designated for such purpose. DT shall not be
liable to any holder of Voicestream Common Shares for any securities
delivered or any amount paid by the Depositary, the Escrow Agent or its
nominee, as the case may be, to a public official which it is so required
to pay under applicable abandoned property laws. Any cash remaining unclaimed
by holders of Voicestream Common Shares five years after the Effective Time
(or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such cash would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental entity or as is
otherwise provided by applicable Legal Requirements (as defined below))
shall, to    11    the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, become the property of the Surviving Corporation or DT, as DT
may determine.   (f) No dividends or other distributions nor any voting
rights with respect to securities of DT issuable to the Escrow Agent with
respect to Voicestream Common Shares shall be paid to or exercised by the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificates until such Certificates are
surrendered as provided in this Section. Subject to the effect of applicable
Legal Requirements, upon such surrender, there shall be issued and/or paid to
the holder of DT Depositary Shares or DT Ordinary Shares issued in exchange
therefor, without interest and after giving effect to any required tax
withholding, (A) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such DT Depositary Shares or DT
Ordinary Shares with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and
(B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such DT Depositary Shares or DT Ordinary Shares with
a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to
such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect
of DT Depositary Shares or DT Ordinary Shares, all DT Depositary Shares and
DT Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued
and outstanding as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
dividends or other distributions nor any voting rights with respect to
securities of DT issuable to the Escrow Agent for the account of
the Dissenting Stockholders Trustee, the Optionholders Trustee, the 7%
Convertible Preferred Shares Trustee, the Restricted Shares Trustee and the
Cook Inlet Trustee (all as defined below) shall be paid to or exercised by
any such trustees.   SECTION 1.07. [Reserved]   SECTION 1.08. Treatment
of Voicestream Stock Plans. (a) Subject to the consummation of the Merger,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase
Voicestream Common Shares (each, a "VOICESTREAM OPTION") will be converted
(and such Voicestream Option will be extinguished) into a right to acquire
(each, a "VOICESTREAM ROLLOVER OPTION") from the Options Trust described in
Annex 1.08(a) (which shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to DT and Voicestream) on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under the Voicestream Option (but taking into account any changes thereto,
including any acceleration thereof, provided for in the option award or in
the Voicestream option plans listed on Schedule 1.08(ii) (the "VOICESTREAM
OPTION PLANS") and applicable to such Voicestream Options by reason of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby) that number of DT Ordinary
Shares (the "VOICESTREAM OPTION AMOUNT") determined by multiplying the
maximum number of Voicestream Common Shares subject to such
Voicestream Option by the Exchange Ratio, rounded if necessary to the nearest
whole DT Ordinary Share at an exercise price per DT Ordinary Share equal to
the exercise price per Voicestream Common Share in effect with respect to
such Voicestream Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
the Exchange Ratio. In order to implement the conversion of the Voicestream
Options described above, the arrangements set forth in Annex 1.08(a) will be
effected at the Effective Time. In the case of a Voicestream Option which is
intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code, the
adjustment in this Section 1.08 shall be modified if necessary to permit such
Voicestream Option to continue to comply with Section 422 of the Code. Prior
to the Effective Time, Voicestream and DT shall mutually agree to
either    12    terminate Voicestream\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan
or to convert the options under such plan to Voicestream Rollover Options
under this Section 1.08(a).   (b) Subject to the consummation of the Merger,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding award of
Voicestream restricted shares that remains subject to restrictions at the
Effective Time (the "VOICESTREAM RESTRICTED SHARES") will be converted (and
such Voicestream Restricted Shares will be extinguished) into a right to
receive (each, a "VOICESTREAM ROLLOVER RESTRICTED SHARE") from the Restricted
Shares Trust described in Annex 1.08(b), on the same terms and conditions and
subject to the same vesting provisions as were applicable to such award under
the Voicestream Plans listed on Schedule 1.08(ii) (but taking into account
any changes thereto provided for in the Voicestream Plans listed on Schedule
1.08(ii)) that number of DT Ordinary Shares (the "RESTRICTED SHARE AMOUNT")
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Voicestream Common Stock
subject to the award by the Exchange Ratio, rounded if necessary, to the
nearest whole DT Ordinary Share. In order to implement the conversion of the
Voicestream Restricted Shares described above, the arrangements set forth in
Annex 1.08(b) will be effected at the Effective Time.   (c) To the extent
that any Person would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a DT
Ordinary Share pursuant to this Section 1.08, such fraction shall be treated
in accordance with Section 1.09.   (d) As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, DT shall cause to be delivered to the holders of Voicestream
Options and Voicestream Restricted Shares appropriate notices setting forth
such holders\' rights pursuant to the respective Voicestream Plans and
agreements evidencing the grants of such Voicestream Options and Voicestream
Restricted Shares (including that, in connection with the Merger and to the
extent provided by the terms of the Voicestream Plans and award agreements
thereunder, the Voicestream Options subject to change of control vesting have
become fully vested).   (e) No later than the Effective Time, DT shall file
or cause to be filed with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate
form or a post-effective amendment to a previously filed registration
statement under the Securities Act with respect to the DT Ordinary Shares and
DT Depositary Shares which are subject to the Voicestream Rollover Options as
provided in Section 1.08(a), and shall use reasonable best efforts to
maintain the current status of the prospectus associated therewith, as well
as to comply with any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws for so
long as such options remain outstanding.   SECTION 1.09. Fractional DT
Depositary Shares and Fractional DT Ordinary Shares. No fraction of a DT
Depositary Share or a DT Ordinary Share will be issued, but each holder of
Voicestream Common Shares otherwise entitled to receive a fraction of a DT
Depositary Share or DT Ordinary Share will be entitled to receive in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.09 from the Escrow Agent a
cash payment in lieu of such fraction of a DT Depositary Share or DT Ordinary
Share, as applicable, (each a "FRACTIONAL INTEREST") representing such
holder\'s proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the
Escrow Agent on behalf of all such holders of the aggregate of the fractions
of DT Depositary Shares and DT Ordinary Shares which would otherwise be
issued ("EXCESS ADSS" and "EXCESS SHARES",    13    respectively). The
sale of the Excess ADSs and the Excess Shares by the Escrow Agent shall be
executed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") and the FSE,
respectively, through one or more member firms of the NYSE or the FSE, as the
case may be, and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.
Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the
holders of Voicestream Common Shares otherwise entitled to receive Fractional
Interests, the Escrow Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such holders
of Voicestream Common Shares (the "COMMON SHARES TRUST"). DT shall pay all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction
costs, including the expenses and compensation, of the Escrow Agent incurred
in connection with such sale of the Excess ADSs and Excess Shares. The Escrow
Agent shall determine the portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each
holder of Voicestream Common Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying
the amount of the aggregate net proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of Fractional Interests
to which such holder of Voicestream Common Shares is entitled and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of Fractional Interests to which
all holders of Voicestream Common Shares are entitled. As soon as practicable
after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders
of Voicestream Common Shares in lieu of any Fractional Interests, the Escrow
Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of Voicestream Common
Shares without interest.   SECTION 1.10. The Surviving Corporation. (a) The
certificate of incorporation of Voicestream in effect at the Effective Time
as amended and restated to be identical to the certificate of incorporation
of Merger Sub shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable law, except that
Article I thereof shall be amended to read: "The name of the Corporation is
Voicestream Wireless Corporation".   (b) The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect
at the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
amended in accordance with applicable law, provided that from and after the
Effective Time the bylaws of Merger Sub shall contain provisions identical to
Article VII of the bylaws of Voicestream as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement.   (c) The directors of Merger Sub and the officers
of Voicestream immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors
and officers of the Surviving Corporation, respectively, and such individuals
shall serve in such positions until their successors shall have been duly
elected and shall qualify.   SECTION 1.11. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed
Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the holder\'s compliance with the replacement requirements
established by the Escrow Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by such
Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Escrow Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration and any cash payable in lieu of Fractional Interests and any

Dissenting Shares. Voicestream Common Shares which are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a holder who
has not voted such shares in favor of the Merger, who shall have delivered a
written demand for appraisal of such shares in the manner provided by
Delaware Law and who shall not have effectively withdrawn or lost such right
to appraisal as of the Effective Time ("DISSENTING SHARES"), shall be
entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as are granted by Section 262
of the Delaware Law. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled to
payment for such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the Delaware
Law shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving Corporation
in accordance with Delaware Law; provided, however, that (i) if any such
holder of Dissenting Shares shall have failed to establish his entitlement to
appraisal rights as provided in Section 262 of the Delaware Law, (ii) if any
holder of Dissenting Shares shall have effectively withdrawn his demand for
appraisal of such Shares or lost his right to appraisal and payment for his
Shares under Section 262 of the Delaware Law or (iii) if neither any holder
of Dissenting Shares nor the Surviving Corporation shall have filed a
petition demanding a determination of the value of all Dissenting Shares
within the time provided for the filing of such petition in Section 262 of
the Delaware Law, such holder shall forfeit the right to appraisal of such
Dissenting Shares and the holder of each such Dissenting Share shall be
deemed to have made a Mixed Election pursuant to Section 1.05(d) and each
such Share shall be converted into the right to receive the Mixed
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.05(d). Voicestream shall give DT prompt
notice of any demands received by Voicestream for appraisal of Voicestream
Common Shares and DT shall have the right to conduct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of DT, Voicestream shall not make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands. To the extent holders of
Dissenting Shares become entitled to DT Ordinary Shares or cash after the
Effective Time, such DT Ordinary Shares and cash to which such holder
of Dissenting Shares is entitled will be issued from the Dissenting
Stockholder Trust described in Annex 1.12 (the "DISSENTING STOCKHOLDER
TRUST").   ARTICLE 2   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF VOICESTREAM

Venture is a party or by which Voicestream, any of such Subsidiaries or any
Cook Inlet Joint Venture or any of their respective property is bound or
affected, except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, for
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights, results or consents which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Voicestream, and except that the consummation of the Merger is conditional
upon receipt of the Voicestream Stockholder Approval.   (b) Except for
applicable requirements, if any, of the Federal Communications Commission
(the "FCC"), the Exchange Act, the premerger notification requirements of the
HSR Act, Council Regulation (EEC) No. 4064/89, if required, filing of a
notice pursuant to Sections 721 of Exon-Florio, filing and recordation of
appropriate merger or other documents as required by Delaware Law and any
filings required pursuant to the rules of any applicable stock exchanges
(collectively, the "VOICESTREAM REQUIRED APPROVALS"), neither Voicestream nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any Cook Inlet Joint Venture is required to
submit any notice, report or other filing with any Governmental or Regulatory
Authority in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement or the DT Financing Agreements. Except as set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence, no waiver, consent, approval or
authorization of any Governmental or Regulatory Authority is required to be

Venture in connection with its execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement or the DT Financing Agreements.   SECTION 2.06. SEC Filings;

the Voicestream SEC Reports (i) were prepared substantially in accordance
with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
may be, and the rules and regulations promulgated under each of such
respective acts, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not

in the Voicestream SEC Reports (or incorporated by reference therein) fairly
present the consolidated financial position of Voicestream and its
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated results

liabilities and obligations which are of a nature not required to be
reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Voicestream and its
Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP and (iv) liabilities and
obligations arising after December 31, 1999 which, individually and in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Voicestream.   SECTION 2.08. Litigation. As of the date hereof, there are
no claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or,
to Voicestream\'s Knowledge, threatened against Voicestream, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Cook Inlet Joint Venture, or any properties or rights of
Voicestream, any of its Subsidiaries or any Cook Inlet Joint Venture, before
any Governmental or Regulatory Authority that would reasonably be expected to
result in an adverse judgment or determination against Voicestream, any of
its Subsidiaries or any Cook Inlet Joint Venture, except for those that are
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Voicestream or prevent Voicestream from consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 2.09. No Violation
of Law; Permits. The business of Voicestream, its Subsidiaries and the Cook
Inlet Joint Ventures is not being conducted in violation of any statute, law,

other self-regulatory body) ("LEGAL REQUIREMENTS"), or in violation of any
permits, franchises, licenses, privileges, immunities, approvals,
certificates, orders, authorizations or consents that are granted by any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority (including, without limitation, any
stock exchange or other self-regulatory body) ("PERMITS"), except for
violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Voicestream. Except as
disclosed in the Voicestream SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, as
of the date hereof, no investigation, review or proceeding by any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority (including, without limitation,
any stock exchange or other self-regulatory body) with respect to
Voicestream, its Subsidiaries or any Cook Inlet Joint Venture in relation to
any alleged violation of law or regulation is pending or, to Voicestream\'s
Knowledge, threatened, nor has any Governmental or Regulatory Authority
(including, without limitation, any stock exchange or other self-regulatory
body) indicated in writing an intention to conduct the same, except for such
investigations which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate,    20    a Material Adverse Effect on Voicestream.
None of the representations and warranties made in this Section 2.09 are
being made with respect to Environmental Laws (as defined below).   SECTION
2.10. Information Provided by Voicestream. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by or on behalf of Voicestream for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement (as defined below)
will, at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by or on behalf of Voicestream for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Voicestream Proxy Statement (as defined below) will, at the dates mailed
to stockholders and at the times of the Voicestream Stockholders\' Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on
behalf of Voicestream for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
German Listing Prospectus will, at the time the German Listing Prospectus is
published, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on
behalf of Voicestream for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
auditor\'s report to be prepared pursuant to Section 183(3) of the German Act
will, at the time the report is filed with the Commercial Register, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None
of the information to be supplied by or on behalf of Voicestream pursuant to
Section 5.07(c) will contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The Registration Statement and the Voicestream Proxy
Statement (except for information relating solely to DT) will comply as to
form in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  
SECTION 2.11. Employee Matters; ERISA. Except as set forth on Schedule
2.11:   (a) Schedule 2.11 contains a true and complete list of all material
employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Voicestream or
its Subsidiaries and covering present or former employees or directors
of Voicestream and of each of its Subsidiaries or their beneficiaries, or
providing benefits to such persons in respect of services provided to any
such entity, or with respect to which Voicestream or any of its Subsidiaries
has, or has had, an obligation to contribute or any other liability,
including, but not limited to, any employee benefit plans within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), any deferred compensation, bonus, stock option, restricted
stock, incentive, profit sharing, retirement, savings, medical, health, life
insurance, disability, sick leave, cafeteria or flexible spending, vacation,
unemployment compensation, severance or    21    change in control
agreements, arrangements, programs, policies or plans and any other benefit
arrangements or payroll practice (collectively, the "VOICESTREAM BENEFIT
PLANS"), whether funded or unfunded, insured or uninsured, written
or unwritten, true and complete copies of which have been provided to DT.  
(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect on Voicestream, all contributions and other payments required
to be made by Voicestream or any of its Subsidiaries to or under
any Voicestream Benefit Plan (or to any person pursuant to the terms thereof)
have been made or the amount of such payment or contribution obligation has
been reflected in the Voicestream Financial Statements.   (c) Each of the
Voicestream Benefit Plans intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or is a prototype plan which has
received a favorable opinion letter, and, to Voicestream\'s Knowledge, no
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected by Voicestream to
adversely affect such qualification, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Voicestream. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Voicestream,
Voicestream is in compliance in all respects with, and each of
the Voicestream Benefit Plans complies in form with, and is and has been
operated in all respects in compliance with, all applicable Legal
Requirements, including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code. No assets of
Voicestream or any of its Subsidiaries are subject to liens arising under
ERISA or the Code on account of any Voicestream Benefit Plan, neither
Voicestream nor any of its Subsidiaries has been required to provide any
security under Sections 401(a)(29) or 412(f) of the Code, or under Section
307 of ERISA, and, to Voicestream\'s Knowledge, no event has occurred that
could give rise to any such lien or a requirement to provide such
security.   (d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Voicestream, to Voicestream\'s Knowledge, there
does not now exist any condition or set of circumstances, that could
subject Voicestream or any of its Subsidiaries to any material liability
arising under any indemnity agreement to which Voicestream or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, excluding liability for benefit claims and funding
obligations payable in the ordinary course. No Voicestream Benefit Plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA has terminated, nor has a "reportable event"
(within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA) occurred with respect to any
such plan (other than such events with respect to which the reporting
requirement has been waived by regulation).   (e) None of the Voicestream
Benefit Plans that are "welfare plans" within the meaning of Section 3(1) of
ERISA provide for any post-employment or retiree benefits other than
continuation coverage required to be provided under Section 4980B of the
Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA, or applicable state law.   (f)
Voicestream has made available to DT a true and correct copy of each current
or last, in the case where there is no current, expired collective bargaining
agreement to which Voicestream or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or under
which Voicestream or any of its Subsidiaries has obligations and copies of
the following documents with respect to each    22    Voicestream
Benefit Plan, where applicable, (i) the plan documents governing such plan
and the most recent summary plan description furnished to employees, (ii) the
most recent annual reports filed with the IRS, (Form 5500-series), including
all schedules and attachments thereto, (iii) each related trust agreement or
other funding arrangement (including all amendments to each such agreement),
(iv) the most recent determination of the IRS with respect to the qualified
status of such Voicestream Benefit Plan, and any currently-
pending application for such a letter, and (v) the most recent actuarial
report or valuation.   (g) The consummation or announcement of any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement will not (either alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or further acts or events) result in any (a)
payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from Voicestream
or any of its Subsidiaries to any officer, employee, former employee or
director thereof or to the trustee under any "rabbi trust" or similar
arrangement, (b) obligation on the part of Voicestream or DT to pay any
excise tax or any similar tax imposed on any employee or former employee of
Voicestream or its subsidiaries under Section 4999 of the Code or any other
similar taxes except as provided in Schedule 4.01(e), (c) benefit under any
Voicestream Benefit Plan being established or becoming accelerated, vested or
payable or (d) "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with
respect to a Voicestream Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.   (h)
The consummation or announcement of any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
further acts or events) result in the disqualification of any of the
Voicestream Benefit Plans intended to be qualified under, result in
a prohibited transaction or breach of fiduciary duty under, or otherwise
violate, ERISA or the Code in a manner that would give rise to material
liability.   (i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Voicestream, neither Voicestream nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of their directors, officers, employees or agents,
nor any "party in interest" or "disqualified person", as such terms are
defined in Section 3 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, with respect to
any Voicestream Benefit Plan, has engaged in or been a party to any
"prohibited transaction", as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code
or Section 406 of ERISA, which is not otherwise exempt, which could result in
the imposition of either a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of
ERISA or a tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code upon Voicestream or its
Subsidiaries, or which could constitute a breach of fiduciary duty which
could result in liability on the part of Voicestream or any of its
Subsidiaries.   (j) No Voicestream Benefit Plan has incurred any
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 412 of the Code or

incurred or reasonably expects to incur, any withdrawal liability with
respect to, any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA).

of the Code or ERISA.     23     (k) No employee is entitled to any
"reload" options under any of the Voicestream Benefit Plans.   SECTION

violation of any applicable employment laws, regulations, ordinances, rules,
orders or decrees.   SECTION 2.13. Environmental Matters. Except for such
matters that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Voicestream, or would not otherwise

whole ("VOICESTREAM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY") except where the failure to have

not have a Material Adverse Effect on Voicestream, and, to Voicestream\'s
Knowledge, neither Voicestream nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any Cook Inlet
Joint Venture has violated any provision of, or committed or failed to
perform any act which with or without notice, lapse of time or both would

except for defaults which individually and in the aggregate would
not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on
Voicestream.   SECTION 2.21. Licenses. (a) Voicestream, each of
its Subsidiaries and each Cook Inlet Joint Venture are the authorized legal
holders or otherwise have rights to all Permits    27    and licenses
and operating rights necessary for the operation of their businesses as
presently operated (collectively, the "SECTION 2.21 LICENSES") and all
Section 2.21 Licenses are in full force and effect, except for such

Voicestream\'s Knowledge, there is not threatened, any action by or before
the FCC or any Governmental or Regulatory Authority to revoke, suspend,
cancel, rescind or modify any of the Section 2.21 Licenses, except for such

2.21 Licenses except for such Section 2.21 Licenses, sold, pledged, disposed
of or encumbered in accordance with Section 4.01(b).   (b) None of the

are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on DT or prevent DT from consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement except as set forth on Schedule

DT SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof and as set forth on Schedule
3.09 hereto, as of the date hereof, no investigation, review or proceeding by
any Governmental or Regulatory Authority (including, without limitation, any

pending or, to DT\'s Knowledge, threatened, nor has any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority (including, without limitation, any stock exchange or
other self-regulatory body) indicated in writing an intention to conduct the
same, except for such investigations which, if they resulted in adverse
findings, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on DT. None of the representations and
warranties made in this Section 3.09 are being made with respect to
Environmental Laws.   SECTION 3.10. Information Provided by DT. None of
the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of DT for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement will,
at the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities
Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on
behalf of DT for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the

nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any orders, decrees, injunctions or
other arrangements (other than those of general applicability not
specifically related to DT) with any Governmental or Regulatory Authority or
is subject to any indemnity or other agreement with any third party relating
to liability under any Environmental Law or relating to Hazardous Substances,
except for such agreements entered into by DT in the ordinary course of
business.   SECTION 3.12. Board Action; Vote Required. (a) The
Management Board (VORSTAND) and the Supervisory Board (AUFSICHTSRAT) of DT
have determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Stockholders Agreement and the DT Financing Agreements are advisable and in
the best interests of DT and its shareholders.   (b) No vote of holders of
any class or series of DT capital stock, including, without limitation,
holders of DT Ordinary Shares or DT Depositary Shares, is required for the

SECTION 3.14. Tax Matters. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.15 attached

following representations to be true, whether considered individually or in
the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on DT;   (a) All
Tax Returns required to be filed by DT or its Subsidiaries on or prior to the

stockholder that would be a "five-percent transferee shareholder" of

1.367(a)-3(c)(5)) following the Merger, to recognize gain pursuant to Section
367(a) of the Code.   (g) DT is not aware of any German withholding taxes
that would be applicable to any Merger Consideration to be received in the
Merger by Voicestream stockholders other than in their capacity as employees
of Voicestream prior to the Effective Time. Except to the extent required
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. (other than
German) tax law, and in the case of withholding or deduction pursuant to
German tax law, except to the extent required solely as a result of a change
in law, including, without limitation, an administrative action by a German
taxing authority or change, amendment to, or clarification of an official
position or an official interpretation, occurring after the date of this
Agreement, neither the Escrow Agent nor DT will deduct or withhold any amount
on account of Taxes (other than stock transfer, stamp taxes, or any other
similar Taxes) from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Escrow Agent or
DT, as the case may be, such withholdings shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Shareholders in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by the Escrow Agent or DT, as the
case may be.   SECTION 3.15. Ownership of Securities. Except pursuant to
the Shareholders Agreement, the DT Financing Agreements or as set forth on

to any agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring,
holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, shares of capital stock of
Voicestream (other than shares held by DT Benefit Plans). Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.16 hereto, DT owns no shares of Voicestream Common Stock which
would constitute Disqualified Shares.   SECTION 3.16. Certain Contracts.
All material contracts required to be filed by DT pursuant to Item 19(b) of
Form 20-F and Instruction B.2 thereto, have been filed as exhibits to, or
incorporated by reference in, a DT SEC Report filed after December 31,

Subsidiaries are the authorized legal holders or otherwise have rights to all
material Permits and licenses and operating rights necessary for the
operation of their business as presently operated, except for such failures
as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on DT
(collectively, the "DT LICENSES"). As of the date hereof there is not pending
and, to DT\'s Knowledge, there is not threatened, any action by or before any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority to revoke, suspend, cancel, rescind or
modify in any material respect any of the DT Licenses which action would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on DT.   ARTICLE

persons with whom they have significant business relations; provided,
however, that no action by Voicestream or its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters specifically addressed by any other provision of this Section 4.01 or
Section 5.15 shall be deemed a breach of this sentence unless such action
would constitute a breach of such other provision. Except as set forth

to, Voicestream or any of its Subsidiaries, adopt or otherwise materially
amend (except for amendments required by Legal Requirements) any Voicestream
Benefit Plan, or enter into or amend any employment or consulting agreement
of the type which would be required to be disclosed hereunder pursuant to
Section 2.11 or grant or establish any new awards under any such existing

policies, methods or procedures, except as required by GAAP, which in the

to the business of Voicestream or its Subsidiaries outside the United States)
that has a non-competition provision or similar operational restriction

38     SECTION 4.02. Conduct of Business by DT. Except as set forth
on Schedule 4.02 hereto or as otherwise expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, DT agrees on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries that they will
not, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, directly or indirectly,
do any of the following without the prior written consent of Voicestream:  
(a) (i) except as may be necessary or required for the purpose of using or

or necessary for the conduct of its business, amend or propose to amend

number of DT Ordinary Shares outstanding as of the date hereof in the
aggregate; or (iv) effect any reclassification, recapitalization or
restructuring or other similar transaction (other than as permitted in clause
(ii) of this Section 4.02(a)) that results in the direct or indirect receipt
by holders of DT Ordinary Shares of any assets, property or cash in respect
of such DT Ordinary Shares.   (b) take any action that would be reasonably
likely to (i) prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; or (ii)
cause the Stockholders of Voicestream to recognize gain pursuant to Section
367(a) of the Code; or   (c) take any action that would reasonably be likely
to (i) materially adversely affect the ability of the Parties to obtain any
Required Regulatory Approval or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, or (ii) materially delay the ability of any of the Parties to obtain
any Required Regulatory Approval or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided, however, that this Section 4.02(c) shall not
preclude any acquisitions by DT or any of its Subsidiaries so long as such
acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
prevent the consummation of the Merger.   SECTION 4.03. No Solicitation.
(a) From and after the date hereof, Voicestream shall not, nor shall it
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall they authorize or instruct any
of their respective officers, directors or employees to, and shall use their
reasonable efforts to cause any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountants or other representatives retained by them or any of
their respective Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly through another
person, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing information), or knowingly take any other action designed to
facilitate, any Alternative Transaction (as defined below), or
(ii) participate in any substantive discussions or negotiations regarding
any Alternative Transaction; provided, however, that if, at any time prior to
the time the Voicestream Stockholders\' Approval is obtained, the Board of
Directors of Voicestream receives an unsolicited bona fide proposal and
determines in good faith that   39    providing information to the
Third Party (as defined below), making such proposal or participating in
negotiations or discussions with the Third Party could be reasonably expected
to result in a Voicestream Superior Proposal (as defined below) and if
Voicestream is not in breach of its obligations under this Section 4.03,
Voicestream may, subject to giving DT 48 hours advance written notice of its
intention to do so, (x) furnish information with respect to Voicestream
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement from the Third Party substantially
similar to the Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement between Voicestream and DT
dated as of June 21, 2000 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), and (y) engage
in discussions and negotiations with the persons that made such
proposal. Voicestream shall promptly notify DT orally and in writing of any
request for information or of any proposal in connection with an Alternative
Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal
and the identity of the person making such request or proposal. Voicestream
will keep DT informed of the status (including amendments) of such request or
proposal on a current basis. Voicestream shall immediately cease and
terminate any existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any
persons conducted heretofore by it or its representatives with respect to the
foregoing.   (b) Nothing contained in this Section 4.03 or in Section 5.02
shall prohibit Voicestream (x) from taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, or (y) from making any disclosure to its stockholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Voicestream, after
receipt of advice from outside counsel, failure to disclose would result in a
reasonable likelihood that the Board of Directors of Voicestream would breach
its duties to Voicestream\'s stockholders under applicable law.   (c) For
purposes of this Agreement, "ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTION" means a proposal or
intended proposal, regarding any of (i) a transaction or series
of transactions pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) other than
a Party and its Subsidiaries (a "THIRD PARTY") acquires or would acquire,
directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under
the Exchange Act) of more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares
of Voicestream, (ii) any acquisition or proposed acquisition of, or business
combination with Voicestream or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, as
applicable, by a merger or other business combination (including any so-
called "merger-of-equals" and whether or not Voicestream or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries, as the case may be, is the entity surviving any
such merger or business combination), other than any transaction that would
be permitted pursuant to Section 5.15 hereof, or (iii) any other transaction
pursuant to which any Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or
indirectly, control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding
equity securities of Subsidiaries of Voicestream and any entity surviving the
merger or business combination including any of them) of Voicestream or any
of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for consideration equal to twenty
percent (20%) or more of the fair market value of all of the outstanding
shares of Voicestream Common Stock on the date of this Agreement.   SECTION
4.04. Subsequent Financial Statements. Voicestream, prior to the Effective
Time, will timely file with the SEC each Annual Report on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Current Report on Form 8-K required to be
filed by it under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder and will promptly deliver to DT copies of each such
report filed with the SEC. DT will timely file with the SEC each Annual  
40    Report on Form 20-F and Report on Form 6-K required to be filed by
it under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and will promptly deliver to Voicestream copies of each such
report filed with the SEC. As of their respective dates, none of such reports
shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The respective audited financial statements and unaudited
interim financial statements of each of Voicestream and DT, as the case may
be, included in such reports will fairly present the financial position of
such Party and its Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the results of
their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended in accordance with
GAAP (with a reconciliation to GAAP in accordance with SEC rules in the case
of Voicestream) or generally accepted accounting principles in Germany (in
the case of DT) applied on a consistent basis and, subject, in the case of
unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments and
any other adjustments described therein.   SECTION 4.05. Control of
Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give DT, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct Voicestream\'s operations prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Voicestream shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its respective operations.   ARTICLE 5   ADDITIONAL
AGREEMENTS   SECTION 5.01. Voicestream Proxy Statement; the
Registration Statement and the German Listing Prospectus. Each of DT and
Voicestream shall cooperate and promptly prepare and DT shall file with the
SEC as soon as practicable a Registration Statement on Form F-4 (or any
successor form) (the "FORM F-4") under the Securities Act with respect to the
DT Ordinary Shares and the DT Depositary Shares issuable and deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement. A portion of the Form F-4 shall serve as a
prospectus with respect to the DT Ordinary Shares and the DT Depositary
Shares issuable and deliverable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
as Voicestream\'s proxy statement with respect to Voicestream Stockholders\'
Meeting (the "VOICESTREAM PROXY STATEMENT"). DT will cause the Form F-4 to
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and Voicestream
will cause the Voicestream Proxy Statement to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder. Voicestream and DT shall use their
reasonable best efforts to have the Voicestream Proxy Statement
and Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC under the Securities
Act, and promptly thereafter shall mail to the holders of record of
Voicestream Common Shares, the Voicestream Proxy Statement; provided,
however, that Voicestream shall not mail or otherwise furnish the Voicestream
Proxy Statement to its stockholders unless and until:   (i) it has received
notice from the SEC that the  Registration Statement is effective under the
Securities Act;   41     (ii) Voicestream shall have received a letter
of its  independent accountants, dated a date within two (2) business days 
prior to the date of the first mailing of the Voicestream Proxy  Statement,
and addressed to Voicestream, in form reasonably  satisfactory to Voicestream
and customary in scope for similar "cold  comfort" letters delivered by
independent public accountants in  connection with registration statements on
Form F-4 with respect to the  financial statements of DT included in the
Voicestream Proxy Statement  and the Registration Statement;   (iii) DT
shall have received a letter of its independent  accountants, dated a date
within two (2) business days prior to the  date of the first mailing of the
Voicestream Proxy Statement, and  addressed to DT, in form reasonably
satisfactory to DT and customary in  scope for similar "cold comfort" letters
delivered by independent  public accountants in connection with registration
statements on Form  F-4 with respect to the financial statements of
Voicestream included in  the Voicestream Proxy Statement and the Registration
Statement.   DT shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain prior to the
effective date of the Form F-4, all necessary state securities law or "Blue
Sky" permits or approvals required to effect the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. DT will advise Voicestream, promptly after it receives
notice, of the time when the Form F-4 has become effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order or the suspension
of the qualification of the DT Depositary Shares or DT Ordinary Shares
issuable and deliverable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale
in any jurisdiction.   (b) DT and Voicestream will cooperate in (i) the
preparation of the Voicestream Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement
and in having the Registration Statement declared effective as soon as
practicable and (ii) the preparation and filing of the German Listing
Prospectus with the FSE and the auditor\'s report with the Commercial
Register.   SECTION 5.02. Voicestream Stockholders\' Meeting
and Consummation of the Merger. (a) As promptly as practicable after
the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities
Act, Voicestream shall duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders (the "VOICESTREAM STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING") in accordance
with Delaware Law for the purposes of obtaining the Voicestream Stockholder
Approval and shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.02(b) hereof,
through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the Voicestream Stockholder Approval.   (b) Neither the Board of Directors
of Voicestream nor any committee thereof shall (i) except as expressly
permitted by this Section 5.02(b), withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to DT, the
approval or recommendation of such Board of Directors or such committee of
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any
Alternative Transaction, or (iii) cause Voicestream to enter into any letter
of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement for any Alternative Transaction (each, a "VOICESTREAM ACQUISITION
AGREEMENT"). Notwithstanding   42    the foregoing, in the event that
prior to the time the Voicestream Stockholder Approval is obtained,
Voicestream receives a Superior Proposal (as defined below), the Board of
Directors of Voicestream may (subject to this and the following sentences)
(A) inform Voicestream stockholders that it no longer recommends Voicestream
Stockholder Approval (a "SUBSEQUENT DETERMINATION"), but only at a time that
is after the second Business Day following DT\'s receipt of written notice
advising DT that the Board of Directors of Voicestream has received a
Superior Proposal specifying the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal (and including a copy or draft copy thereof with
all accompanying documentation or draft documentation, if in writing),
identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal and stating that it
intends to make a Subsequent Determination. After providing such notice,
Voicestream shall provide a reasonable opportunity to DT to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable
Voicestream to proceed with its recommendation to its stockholders without a
Subsequent Determination; provided, however, that any such adjustment shall
be at the discretion of Voicestream and DT at the time. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any proposal (on its most recently
amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a Third Party to
enter into an Alternative Transaction which the Board of Directors of
Voicestream determines in its good faith judgment to be more favorable to
Voicestream\'s stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Voicestream shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders at the
Voicestream Stockholders\' Meeting even if the Board of Directors of
Voicestream shall have made a Subsequent Determination.   SECTION 5.03. Cook
Inlet. Voicestream shall not agree to any modification of the existing
exchange rights agreements relating to the Cook Inlet Joint Ventures that
would (i) prior to the Effective Date, increase the number of Voicestream
Common Shares issuable to the Cook Inlet Joint Ventures upon exercise of
their exchange rights in excess of the maximum number of shares set forth on
Schedule 2.03(f) on and after the Effective Date, increase the number of DT
Ordinary Shares or DT Depositary Shares issuable to the Cook Inlet Joint
Ventures upon exercise of their exchange rights.   SECTION 5.04.
Notification of Certain Matters. Each of Voicestream and DT shall give prompt
notice to each other of the following:   (a) the occurrence or nonoccurrence
of any event whose occurrence or nonoccurrence would be likely to cause
either (i) any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement of such
Party to be untrue, inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect at any
time from the date hereof to the Effective Time if such failure to be true,
accurate or complete would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.02(a)
or 6.03(a) not to be satisfied, in which case the Party required to give
prompt notice thereof shall promptly update and deliver to the others any
Schedules hereto which require an update to remain true, accurate and correct
or (ii) directly or indirectly, any Material Adverse Effect on
such Party;   (b) any material failure of such Party, or any officer,
director, employee or agent of any thereof, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder (if
such failure would cause the condition set forth in Section 6.02(b) or
6.03(b) not to be satisfied);   43     (c) any facts relating to such
Party which would make it necessary or advisable to amend the Voicestream
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement in order to make the statements
therein not misleading or to comply with applicable law; provided, however,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.04 shall not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Parties receiving
such notice; and   (d) Promptly upon receipt by Voicestream from any
Voicestream stockholder who is a party to the Stockholder Agreements of a
proxy card sent to the Voicestream stockholders with the Voicestream Proxy
Statement and in accordance with Section 5 of the Stockholders Agreements,
but in no event later than the second Business Day following such receipt or,
if such receipt is on or after the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing,
then on the date of such receipt, Voicestream shall notify DT orally of its
receipt and provide DT with copy of such proxy card.   (e) Voicestream will
not settle any claim with respect to Section 1.19 and 1.20 the Tax Sharing
Agreement (the "355 Provisions") or amend, modify or terminate the 355
provisions without the prior written consent of DT. Voicestream will promptly
provide DT with any notice of indemnification claim or other notice of
communication with respect to or under the Tax Sharing Agreement with respect
to the 355 Provisions. Voicestream will use its reasonable best efforts to
permit DT to participate in the negotiation, resolution, settlement and
contest of any claim or tax refund related to any items for which Voicestream
has sole indemnification responsibility under the Section 355 Provisions.  
SECTION 5.05. Access to Information. (a) Each of Voicestream and DT shall,
and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries, and its and their
officers, directors, employees, auditors, counsel and agents to afford the
officers, employees, auditors, counsel and agents of the other Parties
reasonable access during regular business hours to such Party\'s and its
Subsidiaries\' officers, employees, auditors, counsel, agents, properties,
offices and other facilities and to all of their respective books and
records, and shall furnish the other with all financial, operating and other
data and information as such other Parties may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Voicestream nor DT shall be required
to provide any information which it reasonably believes it may not provide to
the other Party by reason of any Legal Requirements or other applicable law,
rules or regulations, which constitutes information protected by
attorney/client privilege, or which it or any of its Subsidiaries is required
to keep confidential by reason of contract, agreement or understanding with
third parties.   (b) Each of Voicestream and DT agrees that all non-public,
confidential information so received from any other Party shall be deemed
received pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and each of its and their respective officers, directors,
employees, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants and agents
("PARTY REPRESENTATIVES") to, comply with the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to such information, and the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated herein by
reference with the same effect as if fully set forth herein.   SECTION
5.06. Public Announcements. Voicestream and DT shall develop a joint
communications plan and each Party shall, except as otherwise required by any
Legal   44    Requirement, use its reasonable best efforts to ensure
that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan or, to the extent inconsistent therewith, shall have
received the prior written approval of the other Parties.   SECTION 5.07.
Cooperation. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of
Voicestream and DT agrees, and agrees to cooperate with each other, (w) to
take or cause to be taken all actions and to do or cause to be done all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including all actions expected to be taken
after the Effective Time in connection with the actions contemplated
by Section 1.04), (x) to obtain in a timely manner all necessary Permits
or waivers, from, approvals or consents of, or declarations, registrations
or filings with, and all expirations of waiting periods imposed by,
any Governmental or Regulatory Authority which are necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (y) to promptly (1)
prepare and file a Premerger Notification in accordance with the HSR Act,
comply with any requests for additional information, and obtain termination
of the waiting period thereunder as promptly as practicable, (2) prepare and
file all required notifications, if any, under Council Regulation (EEC) No.
4064/89, and obtain the approval of the Council of the European Union to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if required, and (3) file a

within its control necessary to obtain any Required Regulatory Approvals
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that nothing in this sentence of Section 5.07(a) shall require DT or
Voicestream to take any action that would result in a Burdensome
Condition;   (b) Each of Voicestream and DT agrees to cooperate with each
other (1) to respond to inquiries from, and to make presentations to,
Governmental or Regulatory Authorities; and (2) to promptly inform the others
of any material oral or written communication received by such Party from, or
given by such Party to, any Governmental or Regulatory Authority, and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by
a private Party, in each case regarding the relevant transactions.
Voicestream and DT agree to consult with each other in advance of any meeting
or conference with, or of making any filing or other written submission to,
any such Governmental or Regulatory Authority, and to the extent permitted by
the applicable Governmental or Regulatory Authority, give the others the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences, or to
review and approve any such filing or other written submission, in each case
regarding the relevant transactions.   (c) Each of Voicestream and DT shall
cooperate with each other to eliminate or reduce to the extent possible any
illegality, forfeiture or loss on the part of DT, Voicestream or their
respective Subsidiaries that may result from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (d) Each of Voicestream and DT hereby
agrees to cooperate with the other party, and to cause its officers,
directors and independent accountants to cooperate with the other party, to
do or cause to be done all things reasonably requested by the other party
(including, without limitation, providing such information as may reasonably
be requested to permit pro forma financial statements after giving effect to
the Merger to be produced) in order to facilitate any  
45    financing, acquisition or capital markets transaction to be entered
into by either Party after the date hereof.   (e) Voicestream hereby agrees
to use reasonable best efforts, in consultation with DT, to obtain all
waivers and consents that may be required from any parties to any Voicestream

Agreement, the Stockholders Agreements, the DT Financing Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.   (f) Voicestream hereby
agrees, from the date hereof until the Closing, to take any and all actions
that are required to be taken prior to the Effective Time pursuant to any
Voicestream Contract or other agreement, including, without limitation, any
debt instruments, including credit agreements and indentures, to which
Voicestream or any of its Significant Subsidiaries or any Cook Inlet
Joint Venture is a party and to make any offer to purchase any securities
required to be made, as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Stockholders Agreements and the DT Financing Agreements.  
SECTION 5.08. Indemnification, Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance. (a) For
a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
(i) shall maintain in effect the current provisions regarding indemnification
of officers and directors contained in the charter and bylaws of Voicestream
and each of its Subsidiaries and any directors, officers or employees
indemnification agreements of Voicestream and its Subsidiaries, (ii) shall
maintain in effect the current policies of directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained
by Voicestream ("DandO; INSURANCE") (provided that the Surviving Corporation
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no less
advantageous to the insured), with respect to claims arising from facts or
events which occurred on or before the Effective Time, provided, however, if
the existing DandO; Insurance expires, is terminated or cancelled, or if the
annual premium therefor is increased to an amount in excess of 250% of the
last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof, in each case during such
six year period, the Surviving Corporation will use its best efforts to
obtain DandO; Insurance in an amount and scope as great as can be obtained for
the remainder of such period for a premium not in excess (on an annualized
basis) of 250% of the Current Premium. and (iii) shall indemnify the
directors and officers of Voicestream to the fullest extent to
which Voicestream is permitted to indemnify such officers and directors under
their respective charters and bylaws and applicable law.   (b) Without
limiting Section 5.08(a), after the Effective Time, each of DT and the
Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law, indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former director, officer,
employee and agent of Voicestream or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together
with such person\'s heirs, executors or administrators, an
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against any
costs or expenses (including attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission
occurring or alleged to occur prior to the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as  
46    an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such
service was at the request or for the benefit of Voicestream) or arising out
of or pertaining to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the DT Financing Agreements. In the event
of any such actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) DT
and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall pay the reasonable
fees and out of pocket expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified
Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to DT and the
Surviving Corporation, promptly after statements therefor are received and
shall pay all other reasonable out of pocket expenses in advance of the final
disposition of such action, (ii) DT and the Surviving Corporation will
cooperate and use all reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of
any such matter, and (iii) to the extent any determination is required to be
made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party\'s conduct complies with
the standards set forth under Delaware Law and DT\'s or the Surviving
Corporation\'s respective articles of incorporation or bylaws,
such determination shall be made by independent legal counsel acceptable to
DT or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, and the Indemnified
Party; provided, however, that neither DT nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Parties as a
group may not retain more than one law firm to represent them with respect to
each matter unless there is, under applicable standards of professional
conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between the positions of any two
or more Indemnified Parties.   SECTION 5.09. Stock Exchange
Listings/Establishment of DT Depositary Shares. DT will take all steps
necessary for the listing and authorization for listing on the FSE and the
NYSE (subject to official notice of issuance) of the DT Ordinary Shares and
the DT Depositary Shares, respectively, to be issued pursuant to the
Merger.   SECTION 5.10. No Shelf Registration. DT shall not be required to
amend or maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for the
purpose of permitting resale of the shares of DT received pursuant hereto by
the Persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Voicestream within the
meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act. The DT Ordinary
Shares issuable upon exercise of options pursuant to Section 1.05 hereof
shall be registered under the Securities Act and such registration shall be
effective at the time of issuance.   SECTION 5.11. Affiliates. Voicestream

Agreement a list of all persons who are, as of the date hereof its Affiliates
for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act, and (ii) shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each person who is identified as its
"affiliate" on Schedule 5.11 to deliver to DT as promptly as practicable but
in no event later than the Closing Date, a signed agreement substantially in
the form of Exhibit A. Voicestream shall notify DT from time to time of any
other persons who then are such an "affiliate" of Voicestream and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each additional person who is identified as
such an "affiliate" to execute a signed agreement as set forth in this
Section 5.11.   SECTION 5.12. Blue Sky. DT will use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain prior to the Effective Time all necessary state securities
or "blue sky" Permits and approvals or similar foreign approvals required to
permit the distribution of the DT Depositary Shares and the DT  
47    Ordinary Shares to be issued in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement, and Voicestream will provide any reasonably requested
cooperation in connection therewith.   SECTION 5.13. Tax-Free Merger. Each
of the Parties will use its reasonable best efforts, and each agrees to
cooperate with the other Parties and provide one another with such
documentation, information and materials, as may be reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable, to (i) cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) avoid gain
recognition to the Stockholders of Voicestream pursuant to Section 367(a) of
the Code.   SECTION 5.14. Interim Dividend Policy. Voicestream shall not,
without the prior written consent of DT, declare, set aside or pay any
dividend or distribution payable in cash, stock, property or otherwise with
respect to shares of Voicestream Common Stock.   SECTION 5.15. Permitted
Acquisitions. (a) Voicestream and its Subsidiaries may only engage in an
acquisition transaction taking the form of a stock acquisition, asset
acquisition, merger or similar type or form of transaction, including,
without limitation, any transaction pursuant to which Voicestream would
propose to acquire, directly or indirectly, any additional FCC licenses, and
may only make investments in other Persons (collectively, "ACQUISITIONS")
subject to the provisions of this Section 5.15 and subject to the provisions
of Sections 4.01(h), (i) and (m). Subject to Sections 4.01(h), (i) and (m),
Voicestream and its Subsidiaries may engage in (A) Acquisitions in accordance
with Section 5.15(b), (B) Acquisitions without DT\'s consent, provided that
the aggregate value of the consideration payable by Voicestream and any
of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Acquisition pursuant to this clause (B)
shall not exceed $500 million (including assumption of debt) and in respect
of all Acquisitions pursuant to this clause (B) shall not exceed in the
aggregate $750 million (including assumptions of debt), and, provided
further, that, without consent of the Acquisitions Committee (as hereinafter
defined), none of such Acquisitions include shares of Voicestream or any of
its Subsidiaries as consideration for the transaction, and (C) Acquisitions
permitted (or deemed permitted) by the Acquisitions Committee. The
Acquisitions Committee shall consist of the individuals listed on Schedule
5.15(C). If Voicestream desires to make or engage in an Acquisition requiring
consent of the Acquisitions Committee, it shall notify (a "PROPOSED
ACQUISITION NOTICE") the Acquisitions Committee in writing (care of the
office of the Chairman of the Acquisitions Committee) of such proposed
Acquisition (a "PROPOSED ACQUISITION"). The Proposed Acquisition Notice shall
include or be preceded by a copy of the material information upon which
senior management of Voicestream relied in determining that Voicestream
should pursue the Proposed Acquisition. Unless the Acquisitions Committee
denies permission in writing (in care of the office of Voicestream\'s Chief
Executive Officer) which is received within five (5) Business Days of receipt
of the Proposed Acquisition Notice, the Proposed Acquisition shall be deemed
to have been consented to and permitted by this Section 5.15 and for
all purposes under this Agreement (and shall not count toward the individual
or aggregate dollar limitation set forth in clause (B) of this Section
5.15(a) nor shall any securities issued in connection therewith be deemed to
breach any restriction contained in Section 4.01. DT agrees and acknowledges
that if the Acquisitions Committee denies Voicestream permission to proceed
with any Proposed Acquisition, thereafter any officer, director, stockholder
or Affiliate of Voicestream (other than any of Voicestream\'s Subsidiaries),
or any group or combination of   48    them, may pursue or engage in
such Proposed Acquisition for his, its or their own account. The Acquisitions
Committee shall also, from time to time, consider the capital structure of
Voicestream.   (b) In the event that Voicestream determines to participate
in any auction of spectrum or airwave rights or licenses conducted during the
period from the date hereof until the Effective Time or the termination of
this Agreement (an "AUCTION"), then management of Voicestream shall work with
the Acquisitions Committee to develop, not later than the tenth Business Day
prior to the date the short form application related to such Auction is due,
a schedule (a "BID SCHEDULE") of maximum amounts that Voicestream shall
be permitted to bid in such Auction, which shall set forth both a maximum bid
per license or market (as applicable), and an aggregate maximum for the
entire Auction. In the event that, in the course of an Auction, Voicestream
desires to bid in excess of the maximum bid permitted in the Bid Schedule for
any market or license, as applicable, or the maximum aggregate of all bids,
Voicestream may do so only with the consent of any one of the members of the
Acquisitions Committee (which consent may be sought and/or granted by
telephone). Unless any of the members of the Acquisitions Committee denies
such request to exceed such maximum bid (a "PROPOSED BID INCREASE") within 24
hours of the time such request shall have been made, DT shall be deemed to
have consented to such request. DT hereby agrees and acknowledges that in the
event that Voicestream and the Acquisitions Committee fail to agree upon a
Bid Schedule prior to the tenth Business Day prior to the schedule
commencement of any Auction, thereafter any officer, director, stockholder or
Affiliate of Voicestream (other than any of Voicestream\'s Subsidiaries), or
any group or combination of them, may participate in such Auction and acquire
rights or licenses pursuant thereto for his, its or their own account.  
SECTION 5.16. Reasonable Best Efforts. Each of Voicestream and DT shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinions referred to in
Section 6.02(d) and the delivery of the executed Representation Letters in
the forms set forth in Exhibits D and E hereto.   SECTION 5.17. Certain
Matters. After the Effective Time, DT will take the actions set forth in
Schedule 5.17.   SECTION 5.18. Takeover Laws. Subject to Section 5.02, no
Party shall take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Laws (including any such laws or regulations
applicable to DT under German Legal Requirements or the Legal Requirements of
the FSE) and each of them shall take all necessary steps within its control
to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of), or minimize the effect on,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholders
Agreement from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of,
any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect, including,
without limitation, Section 203 of the Delaware Law or any other Takeover
Laws that purport to apply to this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.   SECTION 5.19. Employee
Benefits. (a) From and after the Effective Time, DT shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its successor to honor all Voicestream employee benefit  
49    plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, subject
to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such terms.
For a period of not less than two years following the Effective Time, DT
shall cause to be provided, to current and former employees of Voicestream
and its Subsidiaries (the "VOICESTREAM EMPLOYEES") compensation and employee
benefits (it being understood that discretionary equity and equity based
awards will remain discretionary) that are, in the aggregate, not less
favorable than those provided to Voicestream Employees immediately before the
Effective Time.   (b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate
and level of benefits (but not benefit accrual under pension or similar
plans) under the employee benefit plans of DT and its Affiliates providing
benefits to any Voicestream Employees after the Effective Time (the "NEW
PLANS"), each Voicestream Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with Voicestream and its Affiliates before the Effective Time, to the
same extent as such Voicestream Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Voicestream Employee
Benefit Plans in which such Voicestream Employee participated or was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided, that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in
a duplication of benefits or for newly established plans and programs for
which prior service of DT employees is not taken into account. In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Voicestream
Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting
time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan
replaces coverage under a comparable Voicestream employee benefit plan or
compensation arrangement or agreements in which such Voicestream Employee
participated immediately before the consummation of the Merger (such plans,
collectively, the "OLD PLANS"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Voicestream Employee, DT shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not
have been waived under the comparable plans of Voicestream or
its subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time and DT shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee\'s participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.   (c) DT hereby acknowledges and agrees that
the transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a Change of Control for
all purposes under the applicable Voicestream Employee Benefit Plans listed
on Schedule 2.11(g).   (d) Voicestream and DT shall, during the sixty-day
period following the date hereof, seek to develop a mutually acceptable
retention plan for senior management employees.   (e) For a period of at
least two years following the Effective Time, DT shall continue and cause to
be honored Voicestream\'s severance policy described in Schedule 4.01(e)  
50    as in effect prior to the Effective Time without any amendments
adverse to Voicestream Employees.   SECTION 5.20. Certain Employment
Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, DT and Voicestream shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispositions of Voicestream Common Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to the Voicestream Common Shares) and
acquisitions of DT Ordinary Shares (including derivative securities with
respect to DT Ordinary Shares) by each Person who is or will be subject to
the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the Voicestream or DT, as the case may be, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.   ARTICLE 6   CLOSING CONDITIONS  
SECTION 6.01. Conditions to Each Party\'s Obligation to Effect the Merger.

Stockholder Approval shall have been obtained.   (b) Legality. No federal,
state or foreign statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree or

Merger.   (c) Required Regulatory Approvals. Any waiting period applicable
to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act shall have expired or
been terminated; to the extent required, the Commission of the European Union
shall have approved the Merger under Regulation (EEC) No. 4064/89 of the
Council of the European Union, or such approval shall have been deemed to
have been granted; the review and investigation under Exon-Florio shall have
been terminated and the President shall have taken no action authorized
thereunder; and any Required Regulatory Approval of the FCC shall have been
received and shall be in full force and effect; provided that the conditions
contained in this paragraph (c) shall not be deemed satisfied as to DT or
Voicestream, if any such consents or authorizations shall contain any
conditions (collectively, "BURDENSOME CONDITIONS") that, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on DT or the mobile telecommunications business of DT, in each case after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby and any other
acquisition in the mobile telecommunication industry which is entered into or
consummated by DT or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof.   (d)

become effective prior to the mailing by Voicestream of the Voicestream Proxy

and on and as of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date; and the
other representations and warranties of DT set forth in this Agreement shall
have been true and correct on the date hereof and, on and as of the Closing
Date as though made on the Closing Date (except to the extent that any
representation or warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which
case it shall be true and correct as of such date) except (i) for changes
permitted under Section 4.02 or otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, and
(ii) for such failures to be true and correct which in the aggregate would
