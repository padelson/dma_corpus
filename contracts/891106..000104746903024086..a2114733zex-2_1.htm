AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

  

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 14, 2003 (this "Agreement"), is entered into by and between Sterling Financial Corporation, a Washington corporation ("Sterling") and Klamath First Bancorp, Inc., an Oregon corporation ("Klamath"). 

  

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Sterling and Klamath have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided for herein in which Klamath will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Sterling, with Sterling being the surviving corporation in such merger (the "Merger"); 

  

 WHEREAS, prior to the consummation of the Merger, Sterling and Klamath will respectively cause Sterling Savings Bank, a Washington State-chartered savings and loan association and wholly-owned subsidiary of Sterling ("Sterling Savings Bank"), and Klamath First Federal Savings and Loan Association, a federal stock savings and loan association and wholly-owned subsidiary of Klamath ("Klamath First Federal"), to enter into a merger agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Institution Merger Agreement"), providing for the merger (the "Institution Merger") of Klamath First Federal with and into Sterling Savings Bank, with Sterling Savings Bank, a Washington State-chartered savings and loan association, being the "Surviving Institution" of the Institution Merger; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Merger is intended to be treated as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger; 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

  

    
ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER 

  

 1.1

 THE MERGER. 
  

 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), Klamath shall merge with and into Sterling, with Sterling being the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger. Upon consummation of the Merger, the corporate existence of Klamath shall cease and the Surviving Corporation shall continue to exist as a Washington corporation. 

  

 1.2

 EFFECTIVE TIME. 
  

 The Merger shall become effective on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 9.1 hereof), as set forth in the articles of merger (the "Oregon Articles of Merger") in the form attached as Exhibit C(1) hereto which shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Oregon on the Closing Date and the articles of merger (the "Washington Articles of Merger") in the form attached as Exhibit C(2) hereto which shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington on the Closing Date. The term "Effective Time" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective on the Closing Date. 

  

 1.3

 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. 
  

 At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 60.497 of the Oregon Business Corporation Act (the "OBCA") and Section 23B.11.060 of the Washington Business Corporation Act (the "WBCA"). 

    

 1.4

 CONVERSION OF KLAMATH COMMON STOCK. 
 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Klamath common stock, each share of Klamath common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Klamath Common Stock") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into 0.77 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Sterling (the "Sterling Common Stock"). 

   

 (b) All of the shares of Klamath Common Stock converted into Sterling Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such shares of Klamath Common Stock (each a "Certificate") shall thereafter represent the right to receive (i) the number of whole shares of Sterling Common Stock and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Klamath Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Certificates previously representing shares of Klamath Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Sterling Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof, without any interest thereon. If after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time Sterling should split or combine its common stock, or declare a dividend or other distribution in such common stock, with a distribution or record date, as applicable, prior to the Effective Time, then the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such split, combination, dividend or distribution. 

  

 (c) At the Effective Time, all shares of Klamath Common Stock that are owned by Klamath as treasury stock and all shares of Klamath Common Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by Sterling or Klamath or any Subsidiary of Klamath or Sterling (except for any issued and outstanding shares held in trust pursuant to the Klamath First Bancorp, Inc. 1996 Management Recognition and Development Plan (the "Klamath MRDP") or the Klamath First Federal Savings and Loan Association Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "Klamath ESOP")) shall be canceled and shall cease to exist and no stock of Sterling or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. For purposes of this Agreement, "Subsidiary" shall have the meaning given that term in Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). 

  

 (d) Certificates for fractions of shares of Sterling Common Stock will not be issued. In lieu of a fraction of a share of Sterling Common Stock, each holder of Klamath Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fraction of a share of Sterling Common Stock shall be entitled to receive an amount of cash equal to the fraction of a share of the Sterling Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, multiplied by the Sterling Determination Price (as defined in Section 8.1(h)). Following consummation of the Merger, no holder of Klamath Common Stock shall be entitled to dividends or any other rights in respect of any such fraction. 

  

 

 1.5

 STERLING COMMON STOCK. 
  

 Each share of Sterling Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be unchanged and shall remain issued and outstanding as common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.6

 OPTIONS. 
  

 At the Effective Time, each option granted by Klamath, pursuant to the Klamath First Bancorp, Inc. 1996 Stock Option Plan (the "Klamath Stock Option Plan"), to purchase shares of Klamath Common Stock (a "Klamath Option") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall be automatically converted into an option to purchase shares of Sterling Common Stock 

     

in an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below and
otherwise subject to the terms of the Klamath Stock Option Plan under which
such option was granted:

  

  

 (a) The number of shares of Sterling Common Stock to be subject to the option immediately after the Effective Time shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of Klamath Common Stock subject to the option immediately before the Effective Time, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of Sterling Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest whole share; and 

  

 (b) The exercise price per share of Sterling Common Stock under the option immediately after the Effective Time shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Klamath Common Stock under the option immediately before the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest cent. The adjustment provided herein shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. The duration and other terms of the option immediately after the Effective Time shall be the same as the corresponding terms in effect immediately before the Effective Time, except that all references to Klamath in the Klamath Stock Option Plan (and the corresponding references in the option agreement documenting such option) shall be deemed to be references to Sterling. 

  

 

 1.7

 RESERVATION OF SHARES AND SECURITIES FILINGS. 
  

 At all times after the Effective Time, Sterling shall reserve for issuance such number of shares of Sterling Common Stock as necessary so as to permit the exercise of Klamath Options converted under Section 1.6 of this Agreement. Sterling shall make all filings required under federal and state securities laws promptly after the Effective Time so as to permit the exercise of such converted Klamath Options and the sale of the Sterling Common Stock received by the optionee upon such exercise at and after the Effective Time. 

  

 1.8

 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. 
  

 At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Sterling, as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.9

 BYLAWS. 
  

 At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Sterling, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.10

 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. 
  

 Subject to Section 6.16, the directors and officers of Sterling immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 1.11

 TAX CONSEQUENCES. 
  
  

 It is intended that the Merger, either alone or in conjunction with the Institution Merger, shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of the Code. 

  

 1.12

 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. 
  

 It is intended that the Merger shall be accounted for as a "purchase" under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). 

    

    
ARTICLE II 
EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

  

 2.1

 STERLING TO MAKE SHARES AVAILABLE. 
  

 At or prior to the Effective Time, Sterling shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Sterling\'s transfer agent, Mellon Investor Services, LLC, or such other similarly-qualified bank, trust company or transfer agent as Sterling may select (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates representing the shares of Sterling Common Stock and the cash in lieu of fractional shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Sterling Common Stock, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to Section 2.2(a) hereof in exchange for outstanding shares of Klamath Common Stock. 

  

 2.2

 EXCHANGE OF SHARES; CONVERSION OF OPTIONS. 
 

  

 (a) Within ten days after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a form letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the shares of Sterling Common Stock and the cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Klamath Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Sterling Common Stock to which such holder of Klamath Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions hereof and (y) a check representing the amount of cash in lieu of a fractional share, if any, which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional shares, unpaid dividends, and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates. 

   

 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to Sterling Common Stock and payable to the holders of record thereof shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Sterling Common Stock represented by such Certificate. 

  

 (c) If any certificate representing shares of Sterling Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Sterling Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Klamath of the shares of Klamath Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are 

  

    
  

presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for certificates representing shares of Sterling Common Stock as
provided in this Article II.

   

 (e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Klamath for six months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Sterling. Any shareholders of Klamath who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Sterling for payment of their shares of Sterling Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on Sterling Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Klamath Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Sterling, Klamath, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Klamath Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Sterling, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Sterling may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Sterling Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 

    
ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF KLAMATH 

  

 Klamath hereby makes the following representations and warranties to Sterling, each of which is being relied upon by Sterling as a material inducement to Sterling to enter into and perform this Agreement. 

  

 3.1

 CORPORATE ORGANIZATION. 
 

  

 (a) Klamath is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Oregon. Klamath has the corporate and other power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of any material business conducted by it or the character or location of any material properties or assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below) on Klamath. Klamath is duly registered as a savings and loan holding company with the Office of Thrift Supervision (the "OTS") under the Home Owners\' Loan Act of 1933 (the "HOLA"). Klamath First Federal, Klamath First Financial Services, Inc., Klamath First Capital Trust I, Klamath First Capital Trust II and Pacific Cascades Financial, Inc. are the only Subsidiaries of Klamath. Section 3.1(a) of the disclosure schedule which is attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Klamath Disclosure Schedule") sets forth true, correct and complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Klamath as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Klamath First Federal is a federal stock savings and loan association duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States. The deposit accounts of Klamath First Federal are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") to the fullest extent permitted by Law (as defined in Section 3.3), and all premiums and assessments due the FDIC in connection therewith have been paid by Klamath First Federal. Klamath First Federal is a "Qualified Thrift Lender" as defined in Section 10(m) of HOLA and the liquidation account established by Klamath First Federal in connection with its conversion from mutual to stock form has been maintained since its establishment in accordance with applicable laws and the records 

  

    
  

with respect to said account (including subaccounts) are complete and
accurate in all material respects. As of the date hereof, Klamath First
Federal is "well-capitalized" (as that term is defined at 12 C.F.R. 565.4)
and its most recent examination rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of
1977 was "satisfactory." Klamath First Financial Services, Inc. and Pacific
Cascades Financial, Inc. are the only Subsidiaries of Klamath First Federal.
Klamath First Federal, Klamath First Financial Services, Inc. and Pacific
Cascades Financial, Inc., respectively, have the corporate and other power
and authority to own or lease all of their properties and assets and to carry
on their business as it is now being conducted and are duly licensed
or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of any
material business conducted by them or the character or location of any
material properties or assets owned or leased by them makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Klamath. Section 3.1(b)
of the Klamath Disclosure Schedule sets forth true, correct and complete
copies of the Charter and Bylaws of Klamath First Federal and the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws (or equivalent documents) of Klamath First Financial
Services, Inc. and Pacific Cascades Financial, Inc. as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement.

  

 (c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(c) of the Klamath Disclosure Schedule, the minute books of Klamath and its Subsidiaries, in all material respects, contain accurate records of all meetings and accurately reflect all other material actions taken by the shareholders, the Boards of Directors and all standing committees of the Boards of Directors since October 1, 1999. 

  

 (d) The term "Material Adverse Effect" with respect to Sterling, Klamath or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, means a condition, event, change or occurrence that has had or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition, results of operations or business of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the ability of such party to timely perform its obligations under, and to consummate the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement; provided, however, that in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred there shall be excluded any effect on the referenced party the cause of which is (i) any change in banking, savings association or similar laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or interpretations thereto by courts or governmental authorities, (ii) any change in GAAP or regulatory accounting requirements applicable to banks, savings associations or their holding companies generally, (iii) any action or omission of Sterling, Klamath or any Subsidiary of either of them taken with the prior written consent of Sterling or Klamath, as applicable, or as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) any changes in general economic, market or political conditions affecting banks, thrifts or their holding companies generally provided that the effect of such changes described in this clause (iv) shall not be excluded to the extent of any materially disproportionate impact (if any) they have on such party and (v) the cost of terminating the contracts with the officers and directors of Klamath that are specified in Section 3.12. 

  

 

 3.2

 CAPITALIZATION. 
 

  

 (a) The authorized capital stock of Klamath consists of 35,000,000 shares of Klamath Common Stock, par value $.01 per share and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share. As of June 30, 2003, there are: (x) 6,980,635 shares of Klamath Common Stock issued and outstanding, including 293,486 shares held by the Klamath ESOP and 53,494 shares held by the Klamath MRDP, of which 31,761 shares have been awarded; (y) no shares of Klamath Common Stock held in Klamath\'s treasury; and (z) no shares of Klamath Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options or otherwise, except for 669,721 shares of Klamath Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the Klamath Stock Option Plan (of which options for 642,940 shares are currently outstanding). No shares of the said preferred stock are issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Klamath Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Except for the 

  

    

Klamath Stock Option Plan and the Klamath MRDP, Klamath does not have and is
not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
commitments or agreements of any character calling for the purchase or
issuance of any shares of Klamath Common Stock or any other equity security of
Klamath or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of Klamath Common Stock or any other equity security of
Klamath. The names of each optionee, the date of each option to purchase
Klamath Common Stock granted, the number of shares subject to each
such option and the price at which each such option may be exercised under
the Klamath Stock Option Plan are set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Klamath

Klamath will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Sterling with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Klamath will promptly (within one business day) advise Sterling following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal of the substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Sterling apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis. As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any tender or exchange offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving Klamath or any of its Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner more than 15% of the voting power in, or more than 15% of the business, assets or deposits of, Klamath or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of Klamath concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (1) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall be regionally recognized investment banking firms), (2) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein (as compared to, and with due regard for, the terms herein) and (3) after taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable Law. For purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "more than 15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "a majority" and the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall only refer to a transaction involving Klamath and not its Subsidiaries; 

  

 (f) other than commitments entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, as set forth in Schedule 5.1(f) of the Klamath Disclosure Schedule, make capital expenditures aggregating in excess of $250,000, except for emergency repairs and replacements;

 (i) take any action that is intended or may reasonably be expected to result in any of its representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming untrue or in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII not being satisfied, or in a violation of any provision of this Agreement or the Institution Merger Agreement, except, in every case, as may be required by applicable Law;

 (p) make any investment, or incur deposit liabilities, other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, or make any equity investments;

 (v) agree or commit to do any of the actions set forth in clauses (a)(u) of this Section 5.1. 

  

  

 The consent of Sterling to any action by Klamath or Klamath First Federal that is not permitted by any of the preceding paragraphs shall be evidenced only by a writing signed by the President or any Executive or Senior Vice President of Sterling. With respect to any written request by Klamath for Sterling\'s consent to any non-permitted action of Klamath or Klamath First Federal described in this Section 5.1, Sterling shall not unreasonably withhold its consent, and Klamath shall be entitled to conclusively presume that Sterling has consented to any such action unless Klamath has received Sterling\'s written objection to such action within five business days after the date of delivery of such written request to Sterling. 

  

 5.2

 COVENANTS OF STERLING. 
  

 During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the Effective Time, except as expressly contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or with Klamath\'s prior written consent, Sterling shall not, and shall not permit Sterling Savings Bank to: 

  

  

 (a) take any action that will result in any of Sterling\'s representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement being or becoming untrue or any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII not being satisfied or in a violation of any provision of this Agreement or the Institution Merger Agreement, except, in every case, as may be required by applicable Law; 

  

 (b) take any action, or amend the Sterling Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, the effect of which would be to materially and adversely affect the rights or powers of shareholders generally; 

  

 (c) take or omit to take any other action that would materially adversely affect or materially delay the ability of Sterling to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals or otherwise materially adversely affect Sterling\'s or Sterling Savings Bank\'s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or 

  

 (d) agree or commit to do any of the actions set forth in clauses (a)(c) of this Section 5.2.

 5.3

 MERGER COVENANTS. 
 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding that Klamath believes that it has established all allowances and taken all provisions for losses required by GAAP and applicable Laws, Klamath recognizes that Sterling may have adopted different loan, accrual and allowance policies (including loan classifications and levels of allowances for losses). In that regard and in general from and after the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Klamath and Sterling shall consult and cooperate with each other in order to formulate the plan of integration for the Merger, including, among other things, with respect to conforming immediately prior to the Effective Time, based upon such consultation, Klamath\'s loan, accrual and allowance policies to those policies of Sterling to the extent consistent with GAAP, provided, however, that no such additional accruals and loss allowances will be: (i) required to be made more than two business days prior to the Closing Date or (ii) deemed to have a Material Adverse Effect upon Klamath if made upon Sterling\'s written request. 

  

 (b) Klamath shall use its reasonable best efforts to terminate or withdraw from the Klamath MRDP, the Klamath ESOP and all other Plans except for the Klamath Stock Option Plan and the Klamath 401(k) Plan, at or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, in accordance with the applicable Plan documents and Laws. Klamath and Sterling shall cooperate in this regard. Sterling agrees, subject to applicable Laws and the Plan documents, to allow any unallocated shares of Klamath Common Stock in the Klamath ESOP (following retirement of all borrowings of the Klamath ESOP) to be allocated to participants and to cause any overfunding to be allocated to participants as earnings. For the period prior to the Effective Time, Klamath and Klamath First Federal shall be permitted to make contributions to the Klamath ESOP, payments on the Klamath ESOP loan and one additional allocation, in October 2003, to the accounts of participants in the Klamath ESOP consistent with past practices on the regularly scheduled payment dates.

If at any time after the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC, and prior to the Closing Date, any event relating to Klamath or Sterling is discovered by Klamath or Sterling, as applicable, which should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Registration Statement, the discovering party shall promptly inform the other party with all relevant information relating to such event, whereupon Sterling shall promptly cause an appropriate amendment to the Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC.

 (d) Sterling and Klamath shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval (as defined in Section 7.1(c) hereof) will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.

Each party shall provide the other party with true, correct and complete copies of all financial and other information relating to the business or operations of itself and its Subsidiaries that is provided to directors of such party or its Subsidiaries in connection with meetings of their Boards of Directors or committees thereof.

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Klamath and its Board of Directors shall be permitted to effect a Change in Klamath Recommendation, if and only to the extent that: 

  

 (i)

 Klamath\'s Board of Directors, based on the advice of its outside counsel, determines in good faith that failure to take such action would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and  


(ii)

 Prior to effecting such Change in Klamath Recommendation: (A) Klamath shall have complied in all material respects with Section 5.1(e), (B) the Board of Directors of Klamath shall have concluded in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Sterling pursuant to clause (D) below, (C) Klamath shall notify Sterling, at least five business days in advance, of its intention to effect a Change in Klamath Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal and furnishing to Sterling a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other material documents, and (D) Klamath shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the period following Klamath\'s delivery of the notice referred to in clause (C) above, negotiate with Sterling in good faith (to the extent Sterling desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.

 EMPLOYEES. 
 

  

 (a) To the extent permissible under the applicable provisions of the Code and ERISA, for purposes of crediting periods of service for eligibility to participate and vesting, but not for benefit accrual purposes, under employee pension benefit plans (within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(2)) maintained by Sterling or a Sterling Subsidiary, as applicable, individuals who are employees of Klamath or any Klamath Subsidiary at the Effective Time will be credited with periods of service with Klamath or the applicable Klamath Subsidiary before the Effective Time (including service with any predecessor employer for which service credit was given under similar employee benefit plans of Klamath or the applicable Klamath Subsidiary) as if such service had been with Sterling or a Sterling Subsidiary, as applicable. Similar credit shall also be given by Sterling or a Sterling Subsidiary, as applicable, in calculating all other employee benefits for such employees of Klamath or a Klamath Subsidiary after the Merger. Sterling will or will cause its applicable Subsidiary to (i) give credit to employees of Klamath and its Subsidiaries, with respect to the satisfaction of the waiting periods for participation and coverage which are applicable under the welfare benefit plans of Sterling or its applicable Subsidiary, equal to the credit that any such employee had received as of the Effective Time towards the satisfaction of any such limitations and waiting periods under the comparable welfare benefit plans of Klamath and its Subsidiaries; (ii) provide each employee of Klamath and its Subsidiaries with credit for any co-payment and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket requirements; (iii) allow each employee of Klamath and its Subsidiaries to have credit for all unused sick leave as of the Effective Time; and (iv) provide coverage for all pre-existing conditions that were covered under any welfare plan of Klamath or the applicable Klamath Subsidiary. Klamath and its Subsidiaries shall cash out any unused vacation time accrued but not taken by employees as of the Effective Time, and Sterling or its Subsidiaries shall give employees credit for prior service for vacation accruals after the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Sterling or Sterling Savings Bank shall provide severance benefits to those employees of Klamath and its Subsidiaries whose employment is involuntarily terminated without cause at or within 365 days of the Effective Time (other than employees who are entitled to receive severance payments under employment or similar agreements) in accordance with Sterling\'s current written severance policy as previously delivered to Klamath. 

  

 (c) Sterling or Sterling Savings Bank shall with respect to those directors of Klamath who are at least age 65 at the Effective Time, determine benefits under the existing Klamath Director Fee Continuation Agreements under Section IV thereof to the extent that benefits thereunder are greater than the benefits that would be received under Section IX thereof. 

  

 (d) Klamath or Klamath First Federal, as applicable, shall make payment of the cash severance amounts provided under the employment agreements and the cash-out payments provided under the salary continuation agreements (as amended) listed in Schedule 3.12 of the Klamath Disclosure Schedule on or before December 31, 2003 but only after satisfaction (or waiver) of all the closing conditions under this Agreement as evidenced by a written agreement executed by the parties and with the scheduled Closing Date on or after January 2, 2004. 

  

 (e) Sterling or Sterling Savings Bank shall pay the "Entitled Percentage" of the "Monthly Premium Paid by KF" as those terms are used on Schedule 3.11(c) of the Klamath Disclosure Schedule"Retiree Census Data," so as to provide the listed retirees with Medicare Supplemental

 6.7

 INDEMNIFICATION. 
 

  

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer or employee of Klamath or any Klamath Subsidiary (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of Klamath or any Klamath Subsidiary or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that, after the Effective Time, Sterling shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses including reasonable attorney\'s fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law (upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to Sterling; provided, however, that (1) Sterling shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon such assumption Sterling shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Sterling elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Sterling and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to Sterling, and Sterling shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) Sterling shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel reasonably required in each applicable jurisdiction for each Indemnified Party, and (3) Sterling shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.7, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Sterling thereof; provided, however, that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Sterling under this Section 6.7 except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices Sterling. Sterling\'s obligations under this Section 6.7 shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. 

   

 (b) Sterling shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the persons serving as officers and directors of Klamath and the Klamath Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered by a directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy of substantially the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are generally not less advantageous than Klamath\'s current policy with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such for a period not less than three years. 

  

    
  

 (c) This Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and is intended to benefit each indemnified person (each of whom shall be entitled to enforce this Section against Sterling). 

  

 (d) In the event Sterling or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any person (other than an affiliate) and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to one or more persons (other than affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act), then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Sterling assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

 6.10

 ADVICE OF CHANGES. 
  

 Sterling and Klamath shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would be reasonably certain to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein. From time to time prior to the Effective Time, each party will promptly supplement or amend its disclosure schedule delivered in connection with the execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such disclosure schedule or which is necessary to correct any information in such disclosure schedule which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such disclosure schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or 7.3(a) hereof, as the case may be, or the compliance by Klamath or Sterling, as the case may be, with the respective covenants set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 hereof. 

  

 6.11

 CURRENT INFORMATION. 
  

 During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Klamath will cause one or more of its designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis (not less than monthly) with representatives of Sterling and to report the general status of the ongoing operations of Klamath. Each party will promptly notify the other party of any material change in the normal course of business or in the operation of the properties of itself or any of its Subsidiaries and of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the threat of litigation involving itself or any of its Subsidiaries, and will keep the other party fully informed of such events.

    6.13

 CHANGE IN STRUCTURE. 
  

 Sterling may elect to modify the structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as noted herein so long as (i) there are no adverse tax consequences to the Klamath shareholders as a result of such modification, (ii) the consideration to be paid to the Klamath shareholders under this Agreement is not thereby changed or reduced in amount, and (iii) such modification will not delay or jeopardize receipt of any Requisite Regulatory Approvals. In the event that the structure of the Merger is modified pursuant to this Section 6.13, the parties agree to modify this Agreement and the various exhibits hereto to reflect such revised structure. In such event, Sterling shall prepare appropriate amendments to this Agreement and the exhibits hereto for execution by the parties hereto. Klamath agrees to cooperate fully with Sterling to effect such amendments.

In rendering such opinion, such counsel shall require and, to the extent such counsel deems necessary or appropriate, may rely upon representations and covenants, including those contained in certificates of officers of Klamath, Sterling, their respective affiliates and others.

 (a) by mutual written consent of Sterling and Klamath; 

  

 (b) by either Sterling or Klamath if: (i) any Governmental Entity which must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied such approval and such denial has become final and nonappealable or (ii) any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless such denial or order shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 

  

 (c) by either Sterling or Klamath if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before July 31, 2004, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein; 

  

    
  

 (d) by either Sterling or Klamath (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if the other party shall have breached (i) any of the covenants or agreements made by such other party herein or (ii) any of the representations or warranties made by such other party herein, and in either case, such breach is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; 

  

 (e) by either Sterling or Klamath if any approval of the shareholders of Sterling or Klamath contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the Klamath Meeting or the Sterling Meeting; 

  

 (f) by either Sterling or Klamath if: (i) the Board of Directors of Klamath shall have failed to recommend to its shareholders the approval of the Merger, or shall have made, or publicly announced its intention to make, a Change in Klamath Recommendation, or (ii) Klamath shall have breached the terms of Section 5.1(e) hereof in any respect adverse to Sterling; 

  

 (g) by Sterling if a tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding shares of Klamath Common Stock is commenced (other than by Sterling or a Subsidiary thereof), and the Board of Directors of Klamath recommends that the shareholders of Klamath tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such shareholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the ten business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act; or 

  

 (h) by Klamath, upon its written notice to Sterling within the two business days following the Determination Date (as defined below), in the event that: 

    

 (1) The failure of the Closing to occur is not due to a material breach by Klamath of any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained herein; 

   

 (2) The Sterling Determination Price (as defined below) on the Determination Date is less than $20.53; and 

  

 (3) (a) the number obtained by dividing the Sterling Determination Price by $24.15 is less than (b) the number obtained by dividing the Final Index Price (as defined below) by the Initial Index Price (as defined below) and then multiplying the quotient in this clause 3(b) by 0.85. 

   

  

 For purposes of this Section 8.1(h), the following terms have the meanings indicated below: 

  

 "Trading Day" means a day that Sterling Common Stock is traded on NASDAQ as reported on the website of www.nasdaq.com.

 "Index Group" means the 20 financial institution holding companies listed on Exhibit F attached hereto. In the event that the common stock of any such company ceases to be publicly traded or a proposal to acquire any such company is announced at any time during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the Determination Date, such company will be removed from the Index Group, and the weights attributed to the remaining companies will be adjusted proportionately for purposes of determining the Final Index Price and the Initial Index Price. The 20 financial institution holding companies and the weights attributed to them are listed on Exhibit F. 

   

 "Initial Index Price" means the sum of each per share closing price of the common stock of each company comprising the Index Group multiplied by the applicable weighting, as such prices are reported on the consolidated transactions reporting system for the market or exchange on which such common stock principally traded on June 13, 2003.

 If Sterling declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of this Agreement and the Determination Date, the prices for the Sterling Common Stock shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes of applying this Section 8.1(h). 

   

 If Klamath elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 8.1(h), it shall give written notice to Sterling within two business days after the Determination Date, such termination will be effective on the third business day after the giving of such notice (the "Effective Termination Date"); provided that within two business days after Sterling\'s receipt of such notice, Sterling shall have the option to increase the consideration to be received by holders of Klamath Common Stock hereunder by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the Exchange Ratio Adjustment Factor (as defined below) to create the Adjusted Exchange Ratio (as defined below) such that Klamath would not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(h). If Sterling so elects, it shall timely give written notice to Klamath of such election and the Adjusted Exchange Ratio whereupon no termination shall be deemed to have occurred pursuant to Section 8.1(h) and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified).

 1)

 $20.53 divided by the Sterling Determination Price; or  


2)

 (a) the number obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial Index Price and multiplying this quotient by 0.85

 (b) Klamath shall pay Sterling a fee (the "Klamath Termination Fee") if this Agreement is terminated under certain conditions. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections 8.1(f) or 8.1(g) the Klamath Termination Fee shall be $6 million and the receipt thereof by Sterling in accordance with the terms hereof shall be Sterling\'s sole and exclusive remedy for a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.1(f) or 8.1(g). If Klamath terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(i), Sterling shall pay Klamath a fee of $1.5 million (the "Sterling Termination Fee"), which shall be Klamath\'s sole and exclusive remedy for a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(i). If Sterling terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) the Klamath Termination Fee shall be $1.5 million, provided that if within 18 months after termination Klamath or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates, an Acquisition Proposal, the Klamath Termination Fee shall be $6 million (net of any prior payment of the said $1.5 million). 

  

 (c) The Klamath Termination Fee or the Sterling Termination Fee, as the case may be, shall be paid within two business days following a termination referred to in Sections 8.1(i) and 8.2(b), as applicable, and shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the party entitled to receive such fee. 

  

 (d) Sterling and Klamath agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that without such agreements they would not have entered into this Agreement and that neither the Klamath Termination Fee nor the Sterling Termination Fee constitute a penalty. If a party hereto fails to pay the amounts due under Section 8.2(b) within the time periods specified in Section 8.2(c), that party shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the other party in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate as published in the Wall Street Journal from the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date of actual payment.

 AMENDMENT. 
  

 Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Klamath; provided, however, that after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by Klamath\'s shareholders, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement which reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to be delivered to Klamath shareholders hereunder other than as contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.
