or permit its officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors and affiliates (collectively, "Representatives") to (i)&nbsp;initiate, solicit, encourage or
knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or (ii)&nbsp;engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any nonpublic information
to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal; provided that, in the event Klamath receives an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal and Klamath's Board of
Directors concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined below), Klamath may, and may permit its Subsidiaries
and its and their Representatives to, take any action described in
clause&nbsp;(ii) above to the extent that the Board of Directors of Klamath concludes in good faith (based on the advice of its outside counsel) that failure to take such actions would more likely
than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law. Prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to this Section, Klamath shall have entered
into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to Klamath than the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section&nbsp;6.2). Klamath will immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this Agreement with any persons other than Sterling with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and will
use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Klamath will promptly (within one business day) advise Sterling following
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal of the substance thereof (including the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Sterling apprised of any related developments,
discussions and negotiations (including the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal) on a current basis. As used in this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any tender or exchange
offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving Klamath or any of its Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner more than 15% of the voting
power in, or more than 15% of the business, assets or deposits of, Klamath or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, "Superior
Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of Klamath concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to its shareholders than
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (1)&nbsp;after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall be regionally recognized investment banking firms),
(2)&nbsp;after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein (as compared to, and with due regard for, the terms herein) and (3)&nbsp;after
taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and any other relevant
factors permitted under applicable Law. For purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "more than 15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "a majority" and the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall only refer to a transaction involving Klamath and not its Subsidiaries; </FONT></P>

has been at any time prior to the

or any of their respective predecessors or (ii)&nbsp;this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the
parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that, after the Effective Time, Sterling shall indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses including reasonable attorney's fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law (upon receipt of any undertaking
required by applicable Law from such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding

if Sterling elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Sterling
and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to Sterling, and Sterling shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties, (2)&nbsp;Sterling shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel reasonably required in each applicable jurisdiction for each Indemnified Party, and
(3)&nbsp;Sterling shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this Section&nbsp;6.7, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Sterling thereof; provided, however, that the failure to
so notify shall not affect the obligations of Sterling under this Section&nbsp;6.7 except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices Sterling. Sterling's obligations under this
Section&nbsp;6.7 shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or
made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. </FONT></P>
