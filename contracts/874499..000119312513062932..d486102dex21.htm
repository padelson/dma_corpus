Section 3.2 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. All adjustments to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price shall be made (x) in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, (y) without duplication (in this Agreement or otherwise) and (z)
only with respect to matters in the case of _Section 3.2(a) _and _Section

(a) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward (without
duplication) by any undisputed amounts for Title Benefits determined pursuant
to _Section 4.3_ (which adjustments shall be made at the time of the final
calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_) and
any other amount provided for elsewhere in this Agreement or otherwise agreed
upon in writing by the Parties as an upward adjustment to the Unadjusted
Purchase Price.

 

(b) The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by (without
duplication) any undisputed amounts for Title Defects determined pursuant to
_Section 4.2_ (which adjustments shall be made at the time of the final
calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_) and

Purchase Price.

pro-rata basis in proportion to the Unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to
such Asset.

 



-3-  ARTICLE 4

TITLE MATTERS

Section 4.1 _Seller s Title_. Except for the special warranty of title set
forth in the Conveyances, Seller makes no warranty or representation, express,
implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to Sellers title to any of the
Assets and Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that, subject to _Section
4.2(e)_, Purchasers sole remedy for any defect of title, including any Title
Defect, (a) with respect to any of the Cleared Assets shall be pursuant to the
special warranty of title set forth in the Conveyances and (b) with respect
to the Uncleared Assets (i) on or before the Title Claim Date, shall be as set
forth in _Section 4.2_ and (ii) from and after the Title Claim Date (without
duplication), shall be pursuant to the special warranty of title set forth in
the Conveyances; _provided, however,_ that Purchaser further acknowledges and
agrees that Purchaser shall not be entitled to protection under the special
warranty of title provided in the Conveyances for any Title Defect reported
under this _Article 4_.

Section 4.2 _Title Defects_

 

(a) . With respect to any Uncleared Asset, to assert a claim of a Title
Defect, Purchaser must deliver a claim notice to Seller (each a " _Title
Defect Notice_ ") promptly after the discovery thereof, but in no event later
than April 30, 2013 (such cut-off date being the " _Title Claim Date_ "). To
be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and shall include
(i) a description of the alleged Title Defect that is reasonably sufficient
for Seller to determine the basis of the alleged Title Defect, (ii) each
Uncleared Asset adversely affected by the Title Defect (each a " _Title
Defect Property_ "), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property,
(iv) all documents upon which Purchaser relies for its assertion of a Title
Defect, including, at a minimum, supporting documents reasonably necessary
for Seller (as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to
verify the existence of the alleged Title Defect and (v) the amount by which
Purchaser reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title
Defect Property is reduced by the alleged Title Defect and the computations
and information upon which Purchasers belief is based, including any analysis
by any title attorney or examiner hired by Purchaser. Any matters that may
otherwise constitute Title Defects, but of which Seller has not been notified
in writing in accordance with the foregoing, shall be deemed to have been
forever waived by Purchaser as of the Title Claim Date for all purposes. With
respect to each Uncleared Asset, if Purchaser has not delivered a Title
Defect Notice with respect to such Uncleared Asset on or prior to the Title
Claim Date, such Uncleared Asset will be deemed a Cleared Asset for all
purposes under this Agreement. Any costs incurred by Purchaser in connection
with its review or examination of title for the Uncleared Assets (but
excluding costs of curative action) shall be charged to the joint account
pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement; _provided, however_ , such
costs will be cumulated with any costs incurred by Purchaser pursuant to the
First Purchase Agreement and allocated to Purchaser and Seller based on their
percentage interests prior to December 31, 2012 (i.e., 45% to Seller and 50%
to Purchaser).

 

(b) Purchaser shall have the obligation to take any curative actions required
to be taken by Purchaser under the terms of the Operating Agreement, and the
costs of any curative actions taken by Purchaser shall be charged to the joint
account pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement; _provided, however_
, that for purposes of curative actions with respect to a Title Defect
Property only, such curative costs will be cumulated with any costs incurred
by Purchaser pursuant to the First Purchase Agreement and allocated to the
Purchaser and Seller

 



-4-   based on their percentage interests prior to December 31, 2012 (i.e., 45% to
Seller and 50% to Purchaser). Any Title Defects that have not been cured,
waived or otherwise resolved by the Parties on or before the date that is 30
days following the Title Claim Date (the " _Remedy Deadline_ ") shall be
exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of _Section
4.4_.

 

(c) In the event that any Title Defect is not waived by Purchaser or cured by
Purchaser prior to the Remedy Deadline, the Parties will adjust the Purchase
Price downward by the lesser of (i) the Allocated Value of the Title Defect
Property and (ii) an amount determined (the " _Title Defect Amount_ ")
pursuant to _Section 4.2(d)_ as being the value of such Title Defect. If the
Unadjusted Purchase Price is adjusted downward by the Allocated Value of the
Title Defect Property, then Purchaser shall re-convey to Seller the entirety
of the Title Defect Property that is adversely affected by such Title Defect,
the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to
the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property and such Title Defect
Property shall no longer be included within the definition of Assets for any
purpose under this Agreement. In the event that Purchaser is required to
reconvey any Title Defect Property to Seller, Purchaser shall assign the
relevant Title Defect Property to Seller with a special warranty of title,
subject to the Permitted Encumbrances, by, through and under Purchaser. Any
downward adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section 4.2_
shall be made (and accounted for) in accordance with the provisions of and at
the times set forth in  _Section 4.2(e)_.

(d) The Title Defect Amount resulting from a Title Defect shall be the amount
by which the Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property adversely affected
by such Title Defect is reduced as a result of the existence of such Title
Defect and shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:

 

(i) if Purchaser and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 

(ii) if the Title Defect is a lien, encumbrance or other charge which is
undisputed and liquidated in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be
the amount necessary to be paid by Seller to remove the Title Defect from
Sellers interest in the affected Title Defect Property;

 

(iii) if the Title Defect reflects a discrepancy between (A) the actual Net
Acres for any Title Defect Property and (B) the Net Acres for such Title
Defect Property as stated in _Exhibit A_ , then the Title Defect Amount shall
be equal to the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property _multiplied by_
the positive difference between such Net Acres amounts;

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon or other defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type
not described in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) above, the Title Defect Amount
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the Title
Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect Property adversely affected
by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential
economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title Defect
Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Purchaser and Seller and
such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation;

 



-5-  (v) If a Title Defect is not in effect or does not materially
adversely affect any Uncleared Asset throughout the entire productive life of
such Uncleared Asset, such fact shall be taken into account in determining the
Title Defect Amount;

 

(vi) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in any other
Title Defect Amount hereunder, or for which Purchaser otherwise receives
credit in the calculation of the Unadjusted Purchase Price or reimbursement
pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement; and

 

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article 4_ , the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated Value of
such Title Defect Property.

(e) Limitations on Applicability.

(i) This _Article 4_ and the special warranty of title provided in the
Conveyances shall be, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement,
the exclusive rights and remedies of Purchaser with respect to Title Defects.
The right of Purchaser to assert a Title Defect under this _Article 4_ shall
terminate on the Title Claim Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that until the
alleged Title Defect or Title Defect Amount, as applicable, is resolved in
accordance with this Agreement, there shall be no termination of Purchasers
or Sellers rights under this _Article 4_ with respect to any alleged Title
Defect or Title Defect Amount properly reported in accordance with _Section
4.4_ on or before the Title Claim Date. Thereafter, Purchasers and Sellers
sole and exclusive rights and remedies with regard to title to the Uncleared
Assets shall be as set forth in the Conveyances. Without limiting the
foregoing, if a Title Defect under this _Article 4_ results from any matter
which could also result in the breach of any representation or warranty of
Seller as set forth in _Article 5_ and Purchaser has knowledge of such matter
prior to the Title Claim Date, Purchaser shall only be entitled to assert
such matter as a Title Defect to the extent permitted by this _Article 4_ and
shall be precluded from also asserting such matter as the basis of the breach
of any such representation or warranty.

 

(ii) [Intentionally Omitted.]

(iii) No adjustments shall be made to the Purchase Price with respect to a
Title Defect for purposes of Closing, and adjustments for Title Defects shall
occur in accordance with the following provision: On May 1, 2013, Seller and
Purchaser shall instruct the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement to (A) first, release to Purchaser the Undisputed Escrow Funds and
(B) second, release to Seller an amount of Escrow Funds equal to (1) all of
the Escrow Funds then remaining in the escrow account (after the payment to
Purchaser of the Undisputed Escrow Funds), _less_ (2) the aggregate of all
Title Defect Amounts for Title Defects properly submitted by Purchaser in
accordance with _Section 4.1_ before May 1, 2013 and for which Purchaser may
be entitled

 



-6-   to relief pursuant to _Section 4.2(c) _but that remain unresolved as of May
1, 2013. With respect to any funds remaining in escrow as of May 1, 2013,
Seller and Purchaser shall instruct the Escrow Agent in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement to release any remaining funds to either Seller or Purchaser,
as applicable, upon final resolution of any pending Title Defects as provided
in this _Article 4_.

 

(iv) Without prejudice to any of the other dates by which performance or the
exercise of rights is due hereunder, or the Parties rights or obligations in
respect thereof, the Parties hereby acknowledge that, as set forth more fully
in _Section 13.13_, time is of the essence in performing their obligations
and exercising their rights under this _ ARTICLE 4_ , and, as such, that each
and every date and time by which such performance or exercise is due shall be
the firm and final date and time.

Section 4.3 _Title Benefits_.

(a) Purchaser has the obligation to deliver to Seller on or before the Title
Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit discovered by Purchaser a notice
(a " _Title Benefit Notice_ ") in writing and including (i) a description of
the Title Benefit reasonably sufficient to determine the basis of the alleged
Title Benefit, (ii) each Uncleared Asset affected by such Title Benefit (each
a " _Title Benefit Property_ "), (iii) the Allocated Value of each Title
Benefit Property, (iv) all relevant documents supporting such Title Benefit,
including, at a minimum, supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller
(as well as any title attorney or examiner hired by Seller) to verify the
existence of the alleged Title Benefit and (v) the amount by which Purchaser
reasonably believes the Allocated Value of each Title Benefit Property is
increased by such Title Benefit and the computations and information upon
which Purchasers belief is based on or before the Title Claim Date.

(b) With respect to each Title Benefit Property affected by Title Benefits
reported under  _Section 4.3(a)_, the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount (the " _Title Benefit Amount_ ") equal to the increase
in the Allocated Value for such Title Benefit Property, as determined pursuant
to  _Section 4.3(c)_. Any upward adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase
Price pursuant to this _Section 4.3_ shall be made (and accounted for) at the
times set forth in _Section 9.4_.

 

(c) The Title Benefit Amount for any Title Benefit shall be equal to the
product of the Allocated Value of the Title Benefit Property  _multiplied by_
the positive difference between (i) the actual Net Acres for any Title Benefit
Property and (ii) the Net Acres for such Title Benefit Property as stated in
_Exhibit A_.

 

(d) If Seller and Purchaser cannot reach an agreement on alleged Title
Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts by the Remedy Deadline, the provisions of
_Section 4.4_ shall apply.

Section 4.4 _Title Disputes_. Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to agree on
all Title Defects and Title Benefits and Title Defect Amounts and Title
Benefit Amounts, respectively, prior to Closing. If, by the Remedy Deadline,
Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on an alleged Title Defect/Title
Benefit or Title Defect Amount/Title Benefit Amount (the " _Disputed_

 



-7-    _Title Matters_ ") such dispute(s), and only such dispute(s), shall be
exclusively and finally resolved in accordance with the following provisions
of this _Section 4.4_. Purchaser shall provide to Seller by not later than
the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Remedy Deadline a written
description meeting the requirements of _Section 4.2(a)_ or _Section
4.3(a)_, as applicable, together with all supporting documentation, of the
Disputed Title Matters. By not later than ten (10) Business Days after
Sellers receipt of Purchasers written description of the Disputed Title
Matters, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a written response setting forth
Sellers position with respect to the Disputed Title Matters together with all
supporting documentation.

(a) By not later than ten (10) Business Days after Purchasers receipt of
Sellers written response to Purchasers written description of the Disputed
Title Matters, Purchaser may initiate a non-administered arbitration of any
such dispute(s), by written notice to Seller of any Disputed Title Matters ("
_Final Disputed Title Matters_ ") not otherwise resolved or waived that are to
be resolved by arbitration (the " _Title Arbitration Notice_ ").

(b) The arbitration shall be held before a one member arbitration panel
(the " _Title Arbitrator_ "), determined as follows. The Title Arbitrator
shall be an attorney with at least ten (10) years experience examining oil and
gas titles in the State of Ohio. Seller and Purchaser shall select by
mutual agreement the Title Arbitrator. If no such agreement is reached within
seven (7) Business Days following the delivery of Title Arbitration Notice,
the Columbus, Ohio office of the American Arbitration Association shall select
an arbitrator from the original lists provided by Seller and Purchaser to
serve as the Title Arbitrator.

(c) Following the selection of the Title Arbitrator, the Parties shall submit
one copy to the Title Arbitrator of (i) this Agreement, with specific

the Final Disputed Title Matters, together with the supporting documents that

Arbitrator shall resolve the Final Disputed Title Matters based only on the

submit additional documentation to the Title Arbitrator nor to demand
discovery on the other Party.

(d) The Title Arbitrator shall make its determination by written decision
within thirty (30) days following Sellers receipt of the Title Arbitration
Notice (the " _Arbitration Decision_ "). The Arbitration Decision shall be
final and binding upon the Parties, without right of appeal. In making its
determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in
this _Article 4_. The Title Arbitrator may consult with and engage
disinterested Third Parties to advise the Title Arbitrator, but shall disclose
to the Parties the identities of such consultants. Any such consultant shall
not have worked as an employee or consultant for either Party or its
Affiliates during the five (5) year period preceding the arbitration nor have
any financial interest in the dispute.

(e) The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Title Defects and Title Defect Amounts or
Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts and shall not be empowered to award
damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any matter.

 



-8-  (f) Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of preparing
and presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half and Purchaser shall bear
one-half of the costs and expenses of the Title Arbitrator, including any
costs incurred by the Title Arbitrator that are attributable to the
consultation of any Third Party. 

(g) Seller and Purchaser shall implement the Arbitration Decision as follows:
(i) in the case of alleged Title Defects determined to be Title Defects,
_Section 4.2(b) _and _Section 4.2(c)_ shall apply to such Title Defect, and
(ii) in the case of disputed Title Benefits and Title Benefit Amounts or Title
Defect Amounts, any amounts determined to be owed by either Party shall be
accounted for in the determination of the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 9.4(a)_. Any alleged Title Defects/Title Benefits determined not to
be Title Defects/Title Benefits under the Arbitration Decision shall be final
and binding as not being Title Defects/Title Benefits. The Parties shall
complete any further conveyancing or reconveyancing of property as is
necessary to effect the remedy. In the case of any such reconveyancing,
Purchaser shall assign the relevant Asset to Seller with a special warranty of
title, subject to the Permitted Encumbrances, by, through and under Purchaser.

(h) Any dispute over the interpretation or application of this _Section 4.4_
shall be decided by the Title Arbitrator with reference to the Laws of the
State of Ohio.

 

Section 4.5 _Consents to Assignment_.

(a) Purchaser shall prepare and send notices to the holders of any required
consents to assignment requesting consents to the Conveyances. If, prior to
the Closing Date, any Party discovers any required consents, then (x) the
Party making such discovery shall provide the other Party with written
notification of such consents, as applicable, (y) Purchaser, following
delivery or receipt of such written notification, will promptly send notices
to the holders of the required consents requesting consents to the Conveyances
and (z) the terms and conditions of this _Section 4.5_ shall apply to the
Assets subject to such consents, as applicable. Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such consents to assignment to
be obtained and delivered prior to Closing; _provided, however_ , that Seller
and Purchaser shall each bear 50% of any payments or obligations to or for the
benefit of the holders of such rights incurred in order to obtain the
required consents. Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser in seeking to obtain
such consents to assignment.

(b) In no event shall there be transferred at Closing any Asset for which a
consent to assignment (other than a Customary Post-Closing Consent) has been
denied in writing or in which the rights to be transferred to Purchaser will
be materially impaired if transferred without the consent (a " _Consent
Requirement_ "); _provided, however_ , that Consent Requirements shall not
include any Customary Post-Closing Consents. In cases in which the Asset
subject to a Consent Requirement is a Contract and Purchaser is assigned the
Property or Properties to which the Contract relates, but the Contract is not
transferred to Purchaser due to the unwaived Consent Requirement,
Purchaser shall continue after Closing to use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the consent so that such Contract can be transferred to Purchaser
upon receipt of the consent. In cases in which the Asset subject to a Consent
Requirement is a Property and the Third Party consent to the transfer of the
Property is not obtained by Closing, the affected Property and the Assets
related to that Property shall not be transferred at Closing. If an 

 



-9-   unsatisfied Consent Requirement with respect to which a purchase price
adjustment is made under _Section 3.2_ is subsequently satisfied prior to May
1, 2013, Seller shall convey the affected Property and related Assets to
Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement. If such Consent Requirement is
not satisfied by May 1, 2013, Seller shall have no further obligation to sell
and convey such Property and related Assets and Purchaser shall have no
further obligation to purchase, accept and pay for such Property and related
Assets, and the Allocated Value thereof shall be deemed to be, on a dollar-
for-dollar basis, included in the relevant Undisputed Escrow Funds. For
purposes of this _Section 4.5(b)_, a Consent Requirement shall be deemed
satisfied if the Person holding the consent right grants consent, without
conditions (unless pursuant to the terms of the document in which the
Consent Requirement is contained, failure to object within a given period is
deemed to be consent, in which case the Consent Requirement shall be deemed
satisfied upon expiration of the period without objection), to the transfer
prior to Closing of the affected Property or other Asset from Seller to
Purchaser.

undertake to agree on the final statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price no
later than 90 days after the Title Claim Date;  _provided, however,_ that if
the date on which the Parties or the Title Arbitrator, as applicable, finally
determines all Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts under _Section
4.4_ is later than the 60th day following the Title Claim Date, such 90 day
period shall be extended the same number of days that such final determination
occurs beyond the 60th day following the Title Claim Date. Within ten (10)
days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of Purchasers 30-day review

Seller.

may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;

(b) by Purchaser (provided Purchaser is not in material breach of this
Agreement), upon written notice to Seller, if there has been a material

this Agreement that has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of Purchaser at the Closing and such breach has not been cured by
Seller prior to the date on which Closing is to occur;

(c) by Seller (provided Seller is not in material breach of this Agreement),
upon notice to Purchaser, if there has been a material breach by Purchaser of

the Closing and such breach has not been cured by Purchaser prior to the date
on which Closing is to occur;

(d) by either Purchaser or Seller, upon notice to the other Party, if any
Governmental Body having competent jurisdiction has issued a final, non-

enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such injunction shall have become final and non-appealable;

 

(e) by Seller, upon notice to Purchaser, if the transactions contemplated at
the Closing have not been consummated by February 22, 2013; or

(f) by Purchaser, upon written notice to Seller, if the condition set forth in
_Section 8.2(e) _has not occurred on or before February 22, 2013.

Section 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall become void and
of no further force or effect (and the provisions of _Section 5.6_, _Section
6.5_, _Section 7.1_, _Article 10_ , _Article 13_ and  _Appendix A_ , which
shall continue in full force and effect) and Seller shall be free immediately
to enjoy all rights of

of the Assets to any party without any restriction under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the termination
of this Agreement under _Section 10.1_ shall not relieve either Party,
subject to _Section 13.10_, from liability for any willful or negligent
failure to perform or observe in any material respect any of its agreements
or covenants contained herein which are to be performed or observed at or
prior to Closing; _provided, however_ , that any failure of the Purchaser to
complete the condition set forth in _Section 8.2(e) _shall not be deemed to
be a willful or negligent failure to perform an agreement or covenant
contained in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 11 

ASSUMPTION; INDEMNIFICATION

indemnity under _Section 11.2_ and Purchasers remedy for Title Defects in

discharged) all of the Assumed Purchaser Obligations.

(a) From and after Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold

(i) caused by or arising out of or resulting from the Assumed Purchaser

SELLER GROUP.

 

(b) From and after Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Purchaser Group from and against all Damages incurred, suffered by or

this _Section 11.2_ contains the Parties exclusive remedies against each
other with respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements of the Parties in _Article 5_ , _Article 6_ and _Article 7_.
Except for the remedies contained in this _Section 11.2_, and _Article 4_ and

DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ADVISORS AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES FROM ANY AND
ALL SUITS, LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, DAMAGES,
LOSSES, COSTS, LIABILITIES, INTEREST, OR CAUSES OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, IN LAW

OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY RELEASED PERSON
(BUT NOT SUCH RELEASED PERSONS WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE).

(d) The indemnity of each Party provided in this _Section 11.2_ shall be for
the benefit of and extend to each Person included in the Seller Group and the
Purchaser Group, as applicable;  _provided_ , _however,_ that any claim for
indemnity under this _Section 11.2_ by any such Person must be brought and
administered by a Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person (including
any Person within the Seller Group and the Purchaser Group) other than Seller
and Purchaser shall have any rights against either Seller or Purchaser under
the terms of this _Section 11.2_ except as may be exercised on its behalf by
Purchaser or Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 11.2(d)_.
Seller and Purchaser may elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification
rights under this Section on behalf of the other Indemnified Persons
affiliated with it in its sole discretion and shall have no liability to any
such other Indemnified Person for any action or inaction under this Section.

Section 11.3  _Indemnification Actions_. All claims for indemnification under
_Section 11.2_ shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 



-22-  (a) For purposes hereof, (i) the term " _Indemnifying Person_ " when used in
connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this _Article 11_ and (ii) the term " _Indemnified Person_ " when
used in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person or Persons
having the right to be indemnified with respect to such Damages by another
Person or Persons pursuant to this _Article 11_.

 

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under _Section 11.2_, an Indemnified
Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim under this _Section
11.3_, including the specific details of and specific basis under this
Agreement for its claim (the " _Claim Notice_ "). In the event that the claim
for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the
Indemnified Person (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Person shall
provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual
knowledge of the Third Party Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if
any) served with respect to the Third Party Claim; _provided_ that the failure
of any Indemnified Person to give notice of a Third Party Claim as provided in
this _Section 11.3_ shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its
obligations under _Section 11.2_ except to the extent such failure results in
insufficient time being available to permit the Indemnifying Person to
effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or otherwise prejudices
the Indemnifying Persons ability to defend against the Third Party Claim. In
the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or
breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice
shall specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was
inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies
its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Third Party
Claim under this _Article 11_. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such 30-day period whether the Indemnifying Person
admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person, it shall be
conclusively deemed to have denied such indemnification obligation hereunder.
The Indemnified Person is authorized, prior to and during such 30-day period,
to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person and
that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right
and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third
Party Claim. The Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense
and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested
by the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in
contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to
contest ( _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Person shall not be
required to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person). The
Indemnified Person may at its own expense participate in, but not control,
any defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the
Indemnifying Person pursuant to this _Section 11.3(d)_. An Indemnifying
Person shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person,
settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect thereto which (i) does not result in a final resolution of the
Indemnified Persons liability with respect to the Third Party Claim
(including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written release of
the Indemnified Person) or (ii) may materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages covered by the
indemnity).

 



-23-  (e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Third
Party Claim (at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of
the Indemnified Persons choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying
Person to admit its obligation and assume the defense of the Third Party Claim
at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the
Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to provide
indemnification with respect to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person
shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Person of any
proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Person shall have the option for ten
(10) days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its
obligation to provide indemnification with respect to the Third Party Claim
and (ii) if its obligation is so admitted, reject, in its reasonable
judgment, the proposed settlement. If the Indemnified Person settles any Third
Party Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying Person after the
Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its obligation in writing and assumed
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to
have waived any right to indemnity therefor.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of
the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its
obligation to provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii)
dispute the claim for such indemnification. If the Indemnifying Person does
not notify the Indemnified Person within such 30-day period that it has cured
the Damages or that it disputes the claim for such indemnification, the
Indemnifying Person shall be conclusively deemed obligated to provide such
indemnification hereunder.

 

Section 11.4 _Limitation on Actions_.

(a) The representations and warranties of the Parties in _Article 5_ and
_Article 6_ and the covenants and agreements of the Parties in _Article 7_
shall survive the Closing for a period of twelve (12) months (unless a
shorter period is expressly provided within the applicable Section), except
that (i) the representations and warranties in _Section 5.2_, _Section 5.3_,
_Section 5.4_,  _Section 5.5_, _Section 6.1_, _Section 6.2_, _Section
6.3_, _Section 6.4_, and _Section 6.5_ shall survive indefinitely and (ii)
the covenants and agreements, as applicable, in  _Section 7.1_, shall
survive indefinitely. The remainder of this Agreement (including the
disclaimers in _Section 5.12_) shall survive the Closing without time limit
except (A) as may otherwise be expressly provided herein and (B) for the
provisions of _Article 12_ , which shall survive Closing until the applicable
statute of limitations closes the taxable year to which the subject Taxes
relate. Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be of no
further force and effect after the date of their expiration; _provided_ that
there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to this
Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement prior to its expiration date.

 



-24-  (b) The indemnities in _Section 11.2(a)(ii)_, _Section 11.2(a)(iii)_, 
_Section 11.2(b)(ii)_ and _Section 11.2(b)(iii)_ shall terminate as of the
termination date of each respective representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that is subject to indemnification thereunder, except in each case
as to matters for which a Claim Notice for indemnity has been delivered to
the Indemnifying Person on or before such termination date. The indemnities in
_Section 11.2(a)(i)_ and _Section 11.2(b)(i)_ shall continue without
time limit.

(c) Seller shall not have any liability for any indemnification under _Section
11.2_ until and unless the aggregate amount of the liability for all Damages
for which Claim Notices are delivered by Purchaser exceeds one percent (1.0%)
of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, and then only to the extent such Damages
exceed one percent (1.0%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this
Agreement, Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Purchaser Group
under this _Article 11_ for aggregate Damages in excess of fifteen percent
(15%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price.

(e) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under this _Article 11_ shall be reduced by the amount of insurance
proceeds realized by the Indemnified Person or its Affiliates with respect to
such Damages (net of any collection costs, and excluding the proceeds of any
insurance policy issued or underwritten by the Indemnified Person or its
Affiliates).

 

(f) In no event shall any Indemnified Person be entitled to duplicate
compensation with respect to the same Damage, liability, loss, cost, expense,
claim, award or judgment under more than one provision of this Agreement and
the various documents delivered in connection with the Closing.

(g) For purposes of this _ARTICLE 11_ , any Damages resulting from any breach
or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties under this Agreement shall
be determined without regard to any materiality qualifiers in or affecting
such representations or warranties.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES SHALL BE

TEXAS AND APPROPRIATE APPELLATE COURTS THEREFROM, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR
CLAIM MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH COURTS. THE PARTIES HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, ANY
OBJECTION WHICH THEY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY
SUCH DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT A DISPUTE,

IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS

Section 13.5 _Amendments; Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may
be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing
and signed, in the case of an amendment, by each Party, or in the case of a
waiver, by the Party against whom such waiver is intended to be effective,
which writing shall specifically reference this Agreement, specify the
provision(s) hereof that it is intended to amend or waive and further specify
that it is intended to amend or waive such provision(s). Any such amendment or
waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose
for which it was given. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies provided by Law.

 

Section 13.6 _Assignment_. No Party shall assign all or any part of this
Agreement, nor shall any Party assign or delegate any of its rights or duties
hereunder, without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent
may be withheld for any reason) and any assignment or delegation made without
such consent shall be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

Section 13.7  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including, for purposes of
certainty, the Appendix, Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto), the
documents to be executed hereunder constitute the entire agreement between the
Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.

 



-28-  Section 13.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement
shall entitle any Person other than Purchaser and Seller to any claims, cause
of action, remedy or right of any kind, except the rights expressly provided
in _Section 11.2(d)_ to the Persons described therein.

 

Section 13.9 _Construction_. The Parties acknowledge that (a) Seller and
Purchaser have had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in
relation to the negotiation of the details of the transaction contemplated
hereby, (b) this Agreement is the result of arms-length negotiations from
equal bargaining positions and (c) Seller and Purchaser and their respective
counsel participated in the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement. Any
rule of construction that a contract be construed against the drafter shall
not apply to the interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

 

Section 13.10 _Limitation on Damages_. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE
CONTRARY, EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DAMAGES INCURRED BY THIRD PARTIES FOR
WHICH INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, NONE OF
PURCHASER, SELLER OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES SHALL BE ENTITLED TO
CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES AND, EXCEPT

REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE PROVISIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT
IN BOLD-TYPE FONT ARE "CONSPICUOUS" FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW AND
COMPLY WITH THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE.

Section 13.13 _Time of Essence_. This Agreement contains a number of dates and
times by which performance or the exercise of rights is due, and the Parties
intend that each and every such date and time be the firm and final date and
time, as agreed. For this reason, each Party hereby waives and relinquishes
any right it might otherwise have to challenge its failure to meet any
performance or rights election date applicable to it on the basis that its
late action constitutes substantial performance, to require the other Party to
show prejudice, or on any equitable grounds. Without limiting the foregoing,
time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the date specified in
this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business
Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be given or any
action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then the date for
giving such notice or taking such action (and the expiration date of such
period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be
the next day which is a Business Day.

 



-29-  Section 13.14 _Severability_. The invalidity or unenforceability of any term
or provision of this Agreement in any situation or jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other terms or provisions hereof
or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction and the remaining terms and
provisions shall remain in full force and effect, unless doing so would result
in an interpretation of this Agreement which is manifestly unjust.
