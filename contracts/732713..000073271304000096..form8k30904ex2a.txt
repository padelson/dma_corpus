Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to the aggregate amount
of (i) the Sellers Allocated Payment (calculated for this purpose using the
Estimated Acquired Company Debt, Estimated Acquired Company Cash and Estimated
Acquired Company Intercompany Debt Receivables) in respect of the Equity
Interests owned by Sellers in each Initial Acquired

<PAGE>

Company (whether such Initial Acquired Company is being transferred directly to
Purchaser or through the transfer of any Direct Acquired Company or Holding
Company, as the case may be), PLUS (ii) the amount of all outstanding principal
and accrued and unpaid interest, together with any other amounts due and
payable, through the Initial Closing in respect of the Sellers Stockholder Debt
relating to each Initial Acquired Company (whether such Initial Acquired Company
is being transferred directly to Purchaser or through the transfer of any
Holding Company), PLUS (iii) with respect to the Colombian Acquired Company, the
amount of the origination fees relating to the Colombian participation agreement
and the underlying loans.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at any Subsequent
Closing, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to the aggregate amount
of (i) the Sellers Allocated Payment (calculated for this purpose using the
Estimated Acquired Company Debt, Estimated Acquired Company Cash and Estimated
Acquired Company Intercompany Debt Receivables) in respect of the Sellers Equity
Interests of each Subsequent Acquired Company (whether such Subsequent Acquired
Company is being transferred directly to Purchaser or through the transfer of
any Holding Company), PLUS (ii) the amount of all outstanding principal and
accrued and unpaid interest, together with any other amounts due and payable,
through the Subsequent Closing in respect of the Sellers Stockholder Debt
relating to each Subsequent Acquired Company (whether such Subsequent Acquired
Company is being transferred directly to Purchaser or through the transfer of
any Holding Company), PLUS (iii) with respect to the Colombian Acquired Company,
the amount of the origination fees relating to the Colombian participation
agreement and the underlying loans.

(c) The payments made under SECTION 2.3(a) and (b) by Purchaser to Sellers with
respect to each Initial Acquired Company and, if any, each Subsequent Acquired
Company shall be made in accordance with SECTION 12.4 and shall be delivered as
follows: (i) 5% of the Sellers Allocated Payment with respect to such Acquired
Company (together with the corresponding percentage of the Minority Equity
Allocated Payment to be placed in a separate escrow with respect to each such
Acquired Company as contemplated by SECTION 3.2(c), the "PURCHASE PRICE
ADJUSTMENT FUND") by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by an escrow agent to be mutually agreed upon by Sellers and
Purchaser (the "ESCROW AGENT"), to be held in escrow and disposed of in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and one or more escrow agreements
between Purchaser, Sellers and the Take-Along Sellers, the terms and conditions
of which shall be mutually agreed and negotiated in good faith between the
parties thereto prior to the applicable Closing (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT"), and
(ii) the balance of the Sellers Allocated Payment with respect to such Acquired
Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or
accounts as the Seller Representative shall designate in writing to Purchaser
not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the applicable Closing Date.
Purchaser shall, however, be entitled to withhold from amounts payable under
this SECTION 2.3(c) any Taxes required to be withheld by Purchaser under
applicable Law, but Purchaser shall only be permitted to withhold such Taxes
after giving Sellers ten (10) Business Days' prior written notice. Sellers shall
promptly notify Purchaser if they reasonably believe that no withholding is
required (and shall provide an opinion of local counsel to such effect) and in
such event Purchaser shall not withhold such Taxes if Sellers agree to indemnify
Purchaser for any Losses incurred as a result of their failure to withhold. Each
Escrow Agreement shall provide that the balance of any escrow funds, together
with all interest accrued thereon, shall be released no later than the Final
Adjustment Payment Date. For the avoidance of doubt, for Tax

<PAGE>

and accounting purposes, the amount of the Allocated Purchase Price applicable
for any Acquired Company that is not acquired directly by Purchaser shall be
allocated to the Equity Interests of the Direct Acquired Companies and/or
Holding Companies that are acquired directly by Purchaser in accordance with
their respective interests in such lower-tier Acquired Companies.

2.4      FINAL PURCHASE PRICE DETERMINATION.

(a) No later than five (5) Business Days before the Initial Closing Date or any
Subsequent Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Purchaser, at Sellers' expense a statement (which statement shall have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP on a basis consistent with the accounting
principles, practices and procedures used in the preparation of the Financial
Statements) setting forth (and accompanied by such documentation as Purchaser
may reasonably request) a calculation of the Sellers Allocated Payment and the
Minority Equity Allocated Payment (each, a "SELLERS ALLOCATED PAYMENT
STATEMENT"), and itemizing, as applicable, with respect to each Initial Acquired
Company or Subsequent Acquired Company that is the subject of the Initial
Closing Date or Subsequent Closing Date: (i) the total Acquired Company Cash,
(ii) the total Intercompany Debt Receivables of such Acquired Company and
(iii) the total Acquired Company Debt, in each case estimated as of
12:01 a.m. New York time on the applicable Closing Date and calculated as of a
date no earlier than five (5) Business Days prior to the Initial Closing Date or
any Subsequent Closing Date. The amount of Acquired Company Debt set forth in a
Sellers Allocated Payment Statement is referred to as the "ESTIMATED ACQUIRED
COMPANY DEBT" for the applicable Initial Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing
Date. The amount of Acquired Company Cash set forth in a Sellers Allocated
Payment Statement is referred to as the "ESTIMATED ACQUIRED COMPANY CASH" for
the applicable Initial Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing Date. The amount
of Intercompany Debt Receivables of such Acquired Company set forth in the
Sellers Allocated Payment Statement is referred to as the "ESTIMATED ACQUIRED
COMPANY INTERCOMPANY DEBT RECEIVABLES" for the applicable Initial Closing Date
or any Subsequent Closing Date. Promptly upon Purchaser's request, Sellers shall
make available to Purchaser copies of the work papers and back-up materials used
by Sellers in preparing the Sellers Allocated Payment Statements and such other
documents as Purchaser may reasonably request in connection with its review of
the Sellers Allocated Payment Statements.

(b) Within forty-five (45) days after the Initial Closing Date or any Subsequent
Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative
at Purchaser's expense a statement (which statement shall have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP on a basis consistent with the accounting principles,
practices and procedures used in the preparation of the Financial Statements)
(a "CLOSING DATE ADJUSTMENT STATEMENT") setting forth with respect to each
Initial Acquired Company acquired on the Initial Closing Date or each Subsequent
Acquired Company acquired on any Subsequent Closing Date a calculation of
(i) the total Acquired Company Cash, (ii) the total Intercompany Debt
Receivables of such Acquired Company and (iii) the total Acquired Company Debt,
in each case calculated as of 12:01 a.m. New York time on the applicable Initial
Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing Date. Promptly upon Sellers' request,
Purchaser shall make available to Sellers copies of the work papers and back-up
materials used by Purchaser in preparing the Closing Date Adjustment Statement
and such other documents as Sellers may reasonably request in connection with
its review of the Closing Date Adjustment Statement.

<PAGE>

(c) Within forty-five (45) days after receipt of a Closing Date Adjustment
Statement, the Seller Representative shall deliver to Purchaser a written
statement describing its objections (if any) to a Closing Date Adjustment
Statement. If the Seller Representative does not raise any objections in a
written statement to Purchaser within such forty-five (45)-day period, the
Sellers shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to a Closing Date Adjustment
Statement and a Closing Date Adjustment Statement shall become final, binding
and conclusive upon all parties. If the Seller Representative raises objections
in a written statement to Purchaser within such forty-five (45)-day period, the
parties shall attempt to resolve their differences and any written resolution by
them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive. If the
parties cannot resolve such objection within ten (10) Business Days after the
receipt by Purchaser of such written statement, any remaining disputes shall be
resolved by KPMG LLP, or if KPMG LLP declines such engagement, by another
internationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually agreeable to
Purchaser and the Seller Representative (the "ACCOUNTING FIRM"). The Accounting
Firm shall be instructed to resolve such disputes within thirty (30) days after
its appointment. The resolution of disputes by the Accounting Firm shall be set
forth in writing (the "ACCOUNTING FIRM ADJUSTMENT STATEMENT") and shall be
conclusive and binding upon all parties and a Closing Date Adjustment Statement,
as modified by such resolution, shall become final and binding as of the date of
such resolution. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
apportioned between the parties by the Accounting Firm based on the degree to
which each party's claims were unsuccessful and shall be paid by the parties in
accordance with such determination. For example, if pursuant to this
SECTION 2.4(c) Sellers submitted an objection affecting the Allocated Purchase
Price in the amount of One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) and prevailed
as to Forty-Five Million Dollars ($45,000,000) of such amount, then Sellers
would bear fifty-five percent (55%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this SECTION 2.4, following
the final determination of all adjustments to be made pursuant to this
SECTION 2.4 at any Closing, if the net aggregate amount of all such adjustments,
taken together, is less than or equal to Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), then
the parties agree that there shall be no adjustment to the purchase price paid
at the Initial Closing or any Subsequent Closing pursuant to SECTION 2.2(a), and
such purchase price shall be deemed to be the final purchase price for all
purposes of this Agreement, PROVIDED, that if such adjustment exceeds
Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), then the total amount (and not only the
excess) of such adjustment will be made and paid for this purpose.

(d) The Acquired Company Debt of an Initial Acquired Company, as of the
Initial Closing Date or of a Subsequent Acquired Company, as of the
Subsequent Closing Date, as determined (i) on the Closing Date
Adjustment Statement deemed to be final in accordance with the second
sentence of SECTION 2.4(c), (ii) by the written resolution of Sellers
and Purchaser or (iii) on the Accounting Firm Adjustment Statement, is
referred to as the "FINAL ACQUIRED COMPANY DEBT." The Acquired Company
Cash of an Initial Acquired Company, as of the Initial Closing Date or
of a Subsequent Acquired Company, as of the Subsequent Closing Date, as
determined (A) on the Closing Date Adjustment Statement deemed to be
final in accordance with the second sentence of SECTION 2.4(c), (B) by
the written resolution of Sellers and Purchaser or (C) on the
Accounting Firm Adjustment Statement, is referred to as the "FINAL
ACQUIRED COMPANY CASH." The Intercompany Debt Receivables of an Initial
Acquired Company, as of the Initial Closing Date or of a Subsequent
Acquired Company, as of the Subsequent Closing Date, as determined (A)
on the Closing Date Adjustment Statement deemed to be final in
accordance

<PAGE>

with the second sentence of SECTION 2.4(c), (B) by the
written resolution of Sellers and Purchaser or (C) on the Accounting
Firm Adjustment Statement, is referred to as the "FINAL ACQUIRED
COMPANY INTERCOMPANY DEBT RECEIVABLES." No later than two (2) Business
Days (the "FINAL ADJUSTMENT PAYMENT DATE") following the date on which
all of the Final Acquired Company Debt, the Final Acquired Company Cash
and the Final Acquired Company Intercompany Debt Receivables of an
Initial Acquired Company or a Subsequent Acquired Company are finally
determined as provided in the first sentence of this SECTION 2.4(d)
(such date being referred to herein as the "DETERMINATION DATE"),
Purchaser or Sellers shall make the following payments with respect to
each Initial Acquired Company and Subsequent Acquired Company after
netting against each other all payments required to be made under this
SECTION 2.4(d):

         (i) If the Estimated Acquired Company Debt is greater than the Final
         Acquired Company Debt with respect to an Acquired Company, then (A) an
         amount equal to the Sellers Allocation Percentage with respect to
         such Acquired Company MULTIPLIED BY the amount of such excess shall
         be paid by Purchaser to Sellers and (B) in the event that there are
         Take-Along Sellers with respect to such Acquired Company, an amount
         equal to the Minority Holders Allocation Percentage applicable to
         such Take-Along Seller MULTIPLIED BY the amount of such excess shall be
         paid by Purchasers to the Take-Along Sellers. If the Estimated
         Acquired Company Debt is less than the Final Acquired Company Debt
         with respect to an Acquired Company, then (A) an amount equal to
         the Sellers Allocation Percentage with respect to such Acquired
         Company MULTIPLIED BY the amount of such deficit shall be paid by
         Sellers to Purchaser and (B) in the event that there are Take-Along
         Sellers with respect to such Acquired Company, an amount equal to the
         Minority Holders Allocation Percentage applicable to such Take-Along
         Seller MULTIPLIED by the amount of such deficit shall be paid by the
         Take-Along Sellers to Purchaser, which deficit payments shall in each
         case be satisfied by a distribution from the Purchase Price Adjustment
         Fund with respect to such Acquired Company or, to the extent that the
         funds deposited in the Purchase Price Adjustment Fund are not
         sufficient to satisfy the full amount of the deficit payments due to
         Purchaser pursuant to this SECTION 2.4(d)(i), the remaining amounts of
         such deficit payments shall be paid directly to Purchaser by Sellers
         and the Take-Along Sellers on a PRO RATA basis.

         (ii) If the Estimated Acquired Company Cash is greater than the Final
         Acquired Company Cash, then (A) an amount equal to the Sellers
         Allocation Percentage with respect to such Acquired Company MULTIPLIED
         BY the amount of such excess shall be paid by Sellers to Purchaser and
         (B) in the event that there are Take-Along Sellers with respect to such
         Acquired Company, an amount equal to the Minority Holders Allocation
         Percentage applicable to such Take-Along Seller MULTIPLIED BY the
         amount of such excess shall be paid by Take-Along Sellers to Purchaser,
         which excess payments shall in each case be satisfied by a distribution
         from the Purchase Price Adjustment Fund or, to the extent that the
         funds deposited in the Purchase Price Adjustment Fund are not
         sufficient to satisfy the full amount of the deficit payments due to
         Purchaser pursuant to this SECTION 2.4(d)(ii), the remaining amounts of
         such deficit payments shall be paid directly to Purchaser by Sellers
         and the Take-Along Sellers on a PRO RATA basis. If the Estimated
         Acquired Company Cash is less than the Final Acquired Company Cash,
         then (A) an amount equal to Sellers Allocation Percentage applicable to
         such Acquired Company MULTIPLIED BY the amount of such deficit shall be
         paid by Purchaser to Sellers, and (B) in

<PAGE>

         the event that there are Take-Along Sellers with respect to such
         Acquired Company, an amount equal to the Minority Holders Allocation
         Percentage applicable to such Take-Along Seller MULTIPLIED BY the
         amount of such deficit shall be paid by Purchaser to the Take-Along
         Sellers.

         (iii) If the Estimated Acquired Company Intercompany Debt Receivables
         are greater than the Final Acquired Company Intercompany Debt
         Receivables, then (A) an amount equal to the Sellers Allocation
         Percentage with respect to such Acquired Company MULTIPLIED BY the
         amount of such excess shall be paid by Sellers to Purchaser and (B) in
         the event that there are Take-Along Sellers with respect to such
         Acquired Company, an amount equal to the Minority Holders Allocation
         Percentage applicable to such Take-Along Seller multiplied by the
         amount of such excess shall be paid by Take-Along Sellers to Purchaser,
         which excess payment shall be satisfied by a distribution from the
         Purchase Price Adjustment Fund or, to the extent that the funds
         deposited in the Purchase Price Adjustment Fund are not sufficient to
         satisfy the full amount of the deficit payments due to Purchaser
         pursuant to this SECTION 2.4(d)(iii), the remaining amounts of such
         deficit payments shall be paid directly to Purchaser by Sellers and the
         Take-Along Sellers on a PRO RATA basis. If the Estimated Acquired
         Company Intercompany Debt Receivables are less than the Final Acquired
         Company Intercompany Debt Receivables, then (A) an amount equal to
         Sellers Allocation Percentage applicable to such Acquired Company
         MULTIPLIED BY the amount of such deficit shall be paid by Purchaser to
         Sellers and (B) in the event that there are Take-Along Sellers with
         respect to such Acquired Company, an amount equal to the Minority
         Holders Allocation Percentage applicable to such Take-Along Seller
         MULTIPLIED BY the amount of such deficit shall be paid by Purchaser to
         the Take-Along Sellers.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this SECTION 2.4, for the purpose of
calculating the Acquired Company Cash, Acquired Company Debt and Intercompany
Debt Receivables of an Initial Acquired Company as of the Initial Closing Date
or, if applicable, a Subsequent Acquired Company as of the Subsequent Closing
Date for purposes of the Sellers Allocated Payment Statement and the Closing
Date Adjustment Statement, any such items denominated in an currency other than
Dollars shall be converted into Dollars from such other currency using the
applicable Exchange Rate.

(f) Each Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that in the event that the value
of its Equity Interests in any Acquired Company is determined to be in an amount
less than zero, then the Allocated Purchase Price with respect to such Acquired
Company shall give full effect to such amount below zero.

                                  ARTICLE III

                   MINORITY EQUITY INTERESTS; TAKE-ALONG OFFER

3.1      MINORITY EQUITY AGREEMENTS; REQUIRED MINORITY EQUITY HOLDER APPROVALS.

(a) SCHEDULE 3.1(a) sets forth, with respect to each Acquired Company that has
Minority Equity Interests, the name of each holder of Minority Equity Interests
(each, a

<PAGE>

"MINORITY EQUITY HOLDER") and a description of the Minority Equity Interests
held by such Minority Equity Holder as of the date hereof. In the event there is
any change in the ownership information set forth in SCHEDULE 3.1(a) after the
date hereof, Sellers shall provide Purchaser with the updated information as
soon as practicable after the relevant change in the ownership of the Acquired
Companies and in no event later than two (2) Business Days prior to the
applicable Closing Date.

(b) SCHEDULE 3.1(b) sets forth, with respect to each Acquired Company that has
Minority Equity Interests, a list of all Contracts with Minority Equity Holders
to which any Seller or the Acquired Company is a party that relate to the
purchase, sale, issuance, repurchase, redemption, acquisition, transfer,
disposition, holding or voting of any Equity Interests in or management of such
Acquired Company (collectively, the "MINORITY EQUITY AGREEMENTS").

(c) From the date of this Agreement until the Final Closing Date, Purchaser,
with respect to its obligations pursuant to this ARTICLE III and subject to the
third to last sentence of this SECTION 3.1(c), and each Seller shall, and
Sellers shall cause each Acquired Company to, use best efforts to (i) obtain, or
cause to be obtained, all of the necessary consents, waivers, modifications,
approvals, certificates and other documents in relation to the Minority Equity
Agreements, each of which is set forth in SCHEDULE 3.1(c) (collectively, the
"REQUIRED MINORITY EQUITY HOLDER APPROVALS") and (ii) subject to the Minority
Equity Holders Rights and solely to the extent required by the terms and
conditions of the Minority Equity Agreements or as otherwise requested by
Sellers, cause the consummation of the sale to Purchaser on the Initial Closing
Date of all of the Minority Equity Interests in those Initial Acquired Companies
or on any Subsequent Closing Date of all of the Minority Equity Interests in
those Subsequent Acquired Companies that are the subject of such Subsequent
Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this ARTICLE III
or otherwise, (A) Sellers shall have full and complete control over all
communications, negotiations, solicitations and other discussions with Minority
Equity Holders with respect to the transactions contemplated in this ARTICLE
III, including all communications, negotiations, solicitations or other
discussions regarding the Required Minority Equity Holder Approvals, Take-Along
Offers, the repayment or treatment of the Stockholder Debt and any other
proposals, offers or transactions whatsoever related to the purchase (whether by
Sellers, Purchaser or otherwise) of Minority Equity Interests (such transactions
are referred to herein collectively as the "TAKE-ALONG TRANSACTIONS") and (B)
neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors (including financial advisors, counsel
and accountants) and representatives (collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES") shall,
directly or indirectly, engage in any communications, negotiations,
solicitations or other discussions with Minority Equity Holders regarding any
Take-Along Transactions or otherwise solicit, initiate, continue, discuss,
negotiate, commit to, enter into or encourage any Take-Along Offers or any other
offers or proposals to or transactions with any Minority Equity Holder with
respect to Minority Equity Interests, except to the extent (and upon such terms
and conditions as) such communications, negotiations, solicitations or other
discussions are specifically authorized and approved in advance by Sellers on a
case-by-case basis. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to
communicate, negotiate or discuss with any Minority Equity Holder with respect
to any Take-Along Transactions unless Sellers, in good faith, reasonably
determine that the communication, negotiation or discussion by Purchaser or its
Affiliates with any Minority Equity Holder is necessary to complete the
Take-Along Transactions. Purchaser will promptly (but in any event within
seventy-two (72) hours) notify Sellers in writing of the receipt by

<PAGE>

Purchaser or any of its Representatives of any inquiries, proposals or offers
from or on behalf of any Minority Equity Holder, which notification shall
include the identity of the party or parties making such inquiry, proposal or
offer and the material terms and conditions of such inquiry, proposal or offer.
Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to Sellers that, to Purchaser's
knowledge, prior to the date of this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Representatives has, directly or indirectly, engaged in any communications,
negotiations, solicitations or other discussions with any Minority Equity
Holders regarding any Take-Along Transactions or any other transactions
whatsoever related to or involving Minority Equity Interests.

(d) Purchaser and each Seller shall, and each Seller shall cause each Acquired
Company to, comply with (i) all Laws and fiduciary and other applicable duties
applicable to the Take-Along Transactions (including the Take-Along Offer,
obtaining the Required Minority Equity Holder Approvals, or otherwise related to
the transactions contemplated in this ARTICLE III) and (ii) all of the terms and
conditions of the Minority Equity Agreements (including such terms, conditions
and procedures related to any "tag along," right of first refusal, or other
participation or consent rights of the Minority Equity Holders set forth in such
Minority Equity Agreements).

(e) Subject to Purchaser's execution of a joint defense agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Sellers, Sellers agree to provide Purchaser
with reasonable access to all pleadings, motions and other similar filings made
by the BellSouth Entities in connection with the Venezuela Arbitration.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Sellers
shall continue to control in all respects the defense and all claims,
counterclaims and other proceedings in respect of the Venezuelan Arbitration in
accordance with SECTION 6.14 until the earlier to occur of (i) the date of the
issuance by the arbitration panel having jurisdiction over the Venezuela
Arbitration of a final, non-appealable resolution of the Venezuelan Arbitration,
or (ii) the final settlement of the Venezuela Arbitration by mutual agreement of
the parties thereto (the "VENEZUELA ARBITRATION AWARD DATE").

(f) If at any time during the period following the Venezuela Arbitration Award
Date through June 30, 2008, any of the Sellers purchase some or all of the
Equity Interests in Comtel Comunicaciones Telefonicas, S.A. and Telcel Celular,
C.A. (collectively, the "VENEZUELAN ARBITRATION ENTITY") held by the holders of
Equity Interests in the Venezuelan Arbitration Entities other than Sellers (the
"VENEZUELAN ARBITRATION SHARES"), Purchaser shall have the right to purchase
(the "VENEZUELA CALL RIGHT"), and Sellers shall have the right to require
Purchaser to purchase (the "VENEZUELA PUT RIGHT"), the Venezuelan Arbitration
Shares at a purchase price per share equal to the Sellers Allocated Payment per
share in respect of the Venezuelan Acquired Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in
no event will Sellers be obligated to sell to Purchaser, or shall Purchaser be
obligated to purchase from Sellers, the Venezuelan Arbitration Shares at any
time prior to any Closing (whether the Initial Closing or any Subsequent
Closing) to which the Venezuelan Acquired Company is subject; PROVIDED, FURTHER
that in the event the Venezuelan Arbitration Shares are to be sold to Purchaser
concurrently with the Initial Closing or any Subsequent Closing to which the
Venezuelan Acquired Company is subject, the sale and purchase of the Venezuelan
Arbitration Shares by Sellers to Purchaser shall be subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions to Closing set forth in ARTICLE VII as applicable to
such Closing. The Venezuela Call Right and Venezuela Put Right may each be
exercised upon ten (10) Business Days' prior written notice by, in the case of
the Venezuela Call Right, Purchaser to

<PAGE>

the Seller Representative, or in the case of the Venezuela Put Right, the Seller
Representative to the Purchaser. In the event that the consummation of the sale
of the Venezuelan Arbitration Shares is not to take place concurrently with the
Initial Closing or any Subsequent Closing, then such sale shall be consummated
on the third (3rd) Business Day following the notification by either Purchaser
or the Sellers Representative of the election to exercise the Venezuela Call
Right or the Venezuela Put Right, as applicable, at such location as mutually
agreed by the parties, in each case subject to the absence of any Governmental
Orders of the type described in SECTION 7.1(a) or Required Regulatory Approvals
of the type described in SECTION 7.1(b). For avoidance of doubt, the Venezuela
Call Right and the Venezuela Put Right shall each terminate on June 30, 2008.

(g) The parties agree that at the applicable Closing, Sellers will assign, and
Purchaser will assume, all of Sellers' rights and obligations under the Minority
Equity Agreements with respect to any Acquired Company that is the subject of
the Initial Closing or any Subsequent Closing for which Minority Equity Holders
will continue to be Minority Equity Holders following the applicable Closing
Date and, if applicable, under any Acquired Company Organizational Document.
Subject to the provisions of SECTION 10.2(a)(vii), Purchaser shall take any and
all other actions necessary in connection with the assignment and assumption of
such Minority Equity Agreements.

3.2      TAKE-ALONG OFFER TO HOLDERS OF MINORITY EQUITY INTERESTS.

(a) Except as otherwise required in order to comply with the Minority Equity
Agreements of an Acquired Company or as otherwise directed by Sellers with
respect to an Acquired Company that has Minority Equity Interests, as soon as
practicable after the Due Diligence Expiration Date, Purchaser shall, subject to
the requirements of SECTION 3.1(c) and to the second sentence of this SECTION
3.2(a), make an offer to each Minority Equity Holder of the subject Acquired
Company to purchase such Minority Equity Interests in accordance with SECTION
2.2(b) at a purchase price per Minority Equity Interest calculated in accordance
with the first sentence of SECTION 3.2(b) (the "TAKE-ALONG OFFER"), which offer
may contain such conditions to Closing as deemed necessary in Purchaser's
reasonable discretion (but only to the extent consistent with the provisions of
this Agreement, applicable Law and the Minority Equity Holder Rights), including
that such Closing is subject to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby with respect to such Acquired Company. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this ARTICLE III or otherwise, Purchaser
shall take the actions described in the first sentence of this SECTION 3.2(a)
only to the extent that such actions are required pursuant to the Minority
Equity Agreements or are otherwise requested by Sellers in their sole
discretion, and such actions shall be taken at the times and in the manner
necessary in order to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable Minority Equity Agreements (including such terms, conditions and
procedures related to any "tag along," right of first refusal, or other
participation or consent rights of the Minority Equity Holders set forth in such
Minority Equity Agreements or any other terms, conditions and procedures agreed
or consented to by the Minority Equity Holders) or at the times and in the
manner requested by Sellers, as applicable. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges that certain Minority Equity Agreements
may require the Take-Along Closing with respect to the Minority Equity Interests
in an Acquired Company to occur concurrently with a Closing or at such other
times as

<PAGE>

further described in such Minority Equity Agreements or as requested by Sellers,
to the extent consistent with this Agreement.

(b) The offer price per Minority Equity Interest in connection with each
Take-Along Offer will be determined by dividing (x) the aggregate Minority
Equity Allocated Payment for the applicable Acquired Company by (y) the
aggregate number of then-outstanding Minority Equity Interests for an Acquired
Company, and will be offered to each Minority Equity Holder subject to (i) any
reduction for any Taxes required to be withheld by Purchaser under applicable
Law, and (ii) to the extent agreed by the relevant Minority Equity Holder or
otherwise required pursuant to any Governmental Order or applicable Law, any
amounts owed by the applicable Minority Equity Holder to Sellers or Seller
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates in respect of any Debt of such
Minority Equity Holder, whether evidenced by a note or otherwise, or other
payment obligations of any kind that remain outstanding as of the date of the
applicable Take-Along Closing (the "BELLSOUTH ENTITIES OWED AMOUNTS"). All
documentation to be executed in connection with the offer and consummation of
the Take-Along Offer, including all offers to purchase, transmittal letters,
purchase agreements and other agreements, instruments and documentation
(collectively, the "TAKE-ALONG DOCUMENTATION"), will be prepared by Sellers,
PROVIDED that such documentation, in any event, will (unless otherwise required
by Law or by the Minority Equity Agreements) (i) require each Minority Equity
Holder to terminate and release all agreements, instruments, covenants and
commitments of or binding on the Acquired Company and Sellers and their
respective affiliates (including, the Minority Equity Agreements) and to further
release the Acquired Company, Purchaser, Sellers and their respective
Representatives and agents from and against any lawsuits, claims, obligations or
liabilities arising prior to the closing of the Take-Along Offer and relating to
their Minority Equity Interests, the Take-Along Offer and their investment and
participation in the Acquired Company, (ii) provide that the Take-Along Offer
shall remain open for at least ninety (90) days or such longer period as
required by applicable Law or the applicable Minority Equity Agreements, (iii)
disclose any other information that is required under any tender offer or
similar Law in the appropriate jurisdictions (iv) require each Minority Equity
Holder to agree to the purchase price adjustment provisions and the escrow
arrangements contemplated in SECTION 2.4 and SECTION 3.2(c) and (v) provide that
each Minority Equity Holder, as a condition of accepting the Take-Along Offer,
shall be liable to Purchaser for all Minority Equity Losses, which liability may
be evidenced by (A) appropriate indemnification provisions in favor of
Purchaser, (B) the Minority Equity Holder's consent and agreement to permit
Purchaser to maintain in escrow a portion of the Minority Equity Allocated
Payment (as finally adjusted pursuant to SECTION 2.4) payable to such Minority
Equity Holder for purposes of fully or partially guaranteeing or otherwise
satisfying or providing for the satisfaction of the Minority Equity Holder's
obligations with respect to such Minority Equity Losses or (C) such other
agreements and transactions reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, Sellers and the
Minority Equity Holder that accomplish the same purposes; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (1)
unless otherwise directed by Sellers, the Minority Equity Holders shall not have
any of the rights of an Indemnifying Person set forth in ARTICLE X with respect
to participation in the defense of any claim pursuant to the indemnification
procedures set forth in ARTICLE X or to approve any proposed settlements related
to Losses under this Agreement and (2) no Seller, Acquired Company or Affiliate
of any Seller or any Acquired Company shall have any liability or obligation
whatsoever with respect to such Minority Equity Losses. Any Losses (including
Minority Equity Losses) that have been conclusively determined to be owed to
Purchaser with

<PAGE>

respect to such Acquired Company at the time of the Take-Along Closing must be
disclosed to Sellers and the Minority Equity Holders such that the amount of
such conclusively determined Minority Equity Losses can be withheld from the
amount of the Minority Equity Allocated Payment otherwise payable to such
Minority Equity Holder.

(c) Each closing of the sale and purchase of the Minority Equity Interests with
respect to an Acquired Company pursuant to a Take-Along Offer (each, a
"TAKE-ALONG CLOSING") shall take place at a location mutually agreed to by
Purchaser and the Seller Representative, on the fifth (5th) Business Day after
the conditions set forth in the applicable Take-Along Offer Documentation shall
have been satisfied or waived or at such other time, date and place as shall be
fixed by agreement. At each Take-Along Closing, unless otherwise agreed in the
Take-Along Offer Documentation, Purchaser shall pay to each holder of the
subject Minority Equity Interests that has accepted the applicable Take-Along
Offer (each, a "TAKE-ALONG SELLER") by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in Dollars, unless otherwise agreed by Purchaser and such Take-Along
Seller, to an account or accounts at a bank specified in writing by such
Take-Along Seller to Purchaser not less than three (3) Business Days prior to
the closing date for such Take-Along Closing an aggregate amount equal to (i)
the Minority Equity Allocated Payment (which amount shall be calculated using
the Estimated Acquired Company Debt and Estimated Acquired Company Cash if the
Take-Along Closing occurs prior to the Determination Date) in respect of the
subject Minority Equity Interests owned by such Take-Along Seller, PLUS (ii) in
the event that the Take-Along Seller Stockholder Debt owed to such Take-Along
Seller becomes due and payable as a result of the Take-Along Closing or to the
extent otherwise reasonably requested by such Take-Along Seller, the amount of
all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest, together with any
amounts due and payable, in respect of such Take-Along Seller Stockholder Debt.
In the event that the Take-Along Closing with respect to an Acquired Company
occurs prior to the Determination Date, (i) the payments made pursuant to
subclause (i) of the preceding sentence by Purchaser to the Take-Along Sellers
with respect to each Acquired Company shall be made in accordance with SECTION
12.4 and shall be delivered as follows: (A) five percent (5%) of the Minority
Equity Allocated Payment with respect to such Acquired Company by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Escrow Agent, to
be held in escrow and disposed of in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the applicable Escrow Agreement and (B) the balance of the Minority Equity
Allocated Payment with respect to such Acquired Company (calculated using the
Estimated Acquired Company Debt and Estimated Acquired Company Cash) to such
account or accounts as the Take-Along Sellers shall designate in writing to
Purchaser not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the closing date for
such Take-Along Closing and (ii) the Minority Equity Allocated Payment paid by
Purchaser at such Take-Along Closing shall be finalized and adjusted pursuant to
the procedures described in SECTION 2.4. If required in order to comply with the
Minority Equity Agreements or the Minority Equity Holders Rights of an Acquired
Company or as otherwise directed by Sellers with respect to an Acquired Company,
Purchaser and Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, use best
efforts to ensure that the Take-Along Closing is consummated concurrently with
the applicable Closing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this ARTICLE III or
otherwise, following the date of this Agreement, Purchaser hereby acknowledges
that Sellers shall have the right to engage in negotiations, communications or
other discussions with any Minority Equity Holder, whether before or after any
Take-Along Offer by Purchaser, regarding any Take-Along

<PAGE>

Transactions, including any transaction in which Sellers would directly purchase
from the Minority Equity Holder some or all of the Minority Equity Interests
held by such Minority Equity Holder. In the event that a Seller purchases some
or all of the Minority Equity Interests of a Minority Equity Holder directly,
then, upon such purchase, if such purchase is consummated (i) on or prior to the
sale to Purchaser, either pursuant to the Initial Closing or any Subsequent
Closing, of Sellers Equity Interests in the Acquired Company in which the
Minority Equity Holder formerly held its Minority Equity Interests, such
Minority Equity Interests shall be deemed to be Sellers Equity Interests for all
purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of allocating the amount of
the Aggregate Sellers Allocated Payment and the Sellers Allocated Payments, as
the case may be, for determining the extent of such Sellers' indemnification
obligations pursuant to SECTION 10.4(b) and (c), or (ii) at any time following
the sale to Purchaser, either pursuant to the Initial Closing or any Subsequent
Closing, of Sellers Equity Interests in the Acquired Company in which the
Minority Equity Holder formerly held its Minority Equity Interests, such Seller
shall be deemed to be a Take-Along Seller for purposes of this ARTICLE III and
Sellers shall be required to sell, and Purchaser shall be required to purchase,
the Minority Equity Interests held by such Seller in the manner and pursuant to
the terms (including the purchase price) contemplated in SECTION 3.2(c),
PROVIDED, that (A) the purchase by Purchaser of such Minority Equity Interests
from such Seller shall be made pursuant to the same terms and conditions,
including representations and warranties, as contemplated in this Agreement with
respect to the Sellers Equity Interests in the Acquired Companies, and (B) the
purchase price paid by Purchaser to any Seller with respect to such Minority
Equity Interests as contemplated in SECTION 3.2(c) shall be deemed to increase
the amount of the Aggregate Sellers Allocated Payment and the Sellers Allocated
Payment, as the case may be, for purposes of determining the extent of such
Sellers' indemnification obligations pursuant to SECTION 10.4(b) and (c).

3.3      SALE OF EQUITY INTERESTS PURSUANT TO RIGHTS OF FIRST REFUSAL.

(a) The Minority Equity Agreements set forth on SCHEDULE 3.3(a) of certain
Acquired Companies provide rights of first refusal or other rights to such
Minority Equity Holders to purchase the Equity Interests owned by Sellers in
such Acquired Companies ("RIGHTS OF FIRST REFUSAL") that become exercisable as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that,
prior to the applicable Closing, any one or more of such Minority Equity Holders
makes a bona fide election to exercise its Rights of First Refusal with respect
to some or all of the Equity Interests owned by Sellers in one or more Acquired
Companies in accordance with the provisions of any applicable Minority Equity
Agreement (the "RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL SHARES"), then, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or otherwise, (i) Sellers shall have
no obligation to sell the Right of First Refusal Shares to Purchaser and
Purchaser shall have no right to purchase the Right of First Refusal Shares from
Sellers, (ii) Sellers shall be deemed not to own, directly or indirectly, the
Right of First Refusal Shares, (iii) such Right of First Refusal Shares shall be
deemed to be excluded from the definition of "Sellers Equity Interests" and
"Holding Company Equity Interests" and shall not be considered Equity Interests
owned directly or indirectly by Sellers, for all purposes of this Agreement,
(iv) the Sellers Allocation Percentage and the amount of the Sellers Allocated
Payment with respect to the Acquired Companies that have Right of First Refusal
Shares shall be decreased accordingly for all purposes of this Agreement,
including with respect to determining the extent of Sellers' indemnification
obligations pursuant to SECTION 10.4(b), (c) and (d), (v) the

<PAGE>

Right of First Refusal Shares will be understood to be owned by the Minority
Equity Holders, (vi) the Minority Equity Holder Allocation Percentage and the
amount of the Minority Equity Holders Allocated Payment with respect to the
Acquired Companies that have Right of First Refusal Shares shall be increased
accordingly for all purposes of this Agreement, and (vii) if and at such time as
one or more of the Minority Equity Holders of such Acquired Company makes a bona
fide election to exercise their Rights of First Refusal (the "ROFR DETERMINATION
DATE") and, as a result of such bona fide election, Sellers do not own (or, upon
the closing of the sale of such Right of First Refusal Shares, will not own) any
Equity Interests in such Acquired Company, then such Acquired Company shall be
deemed to be a "ROFR COMPANY".

(b) In addition to the foregoing, in the event that any Acquired Company becomes
a ROFR Company, (i) the parties shall nevertheless be obligated to consummate
the Initial Closing and any Subsequent Closing and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement except with respect to any such ROFR Company (or
any Retained Company or Section 6.29 Retained Company) and (ii) no
representations or warranties shall be deemed to have been made by Sellers with
respect to any such ROFR Company. For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the
ROFR Determination Date with respect to a ROFR Company, SECTIONS 6.5 and 6.6 and
ARTICLE III, as well as any other provisions that would otherwise reasonably be
interpreted to treat such ROFR Company as an Acquired Company whose Sellers
Equity Interests are being transferred directly or indirectly pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will no longer be applicable to
such ROFR Company, PROVIDED THAT, SECTIONS 6.8 and 6.28(a) and (b) (PROVIDED
THAT, with respect to SECTIONS 6.28(a) and (b), such restrictions shall apply
from the date of this Agreement until the applicable closing with respect to the
Right of First Refusal Shares of such ROFR Company) as well as the
Confidentiality Agreement will continue to be applicable to all ROFR Companies.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

Agreements by each Seller which is to be a party thereto, and the consummation

in each case, enforceable in accordance with its respective terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar laws in effect that affect the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally and by equitable limitations on the availability
of specific remedies and by principles of equity (collectively, "ENFORCEABILITY
LIMITATIONS").

4.3      AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE
4.3 and except as would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, the execution, delivery and performance by each Seller of this Agreement

Acquired Company is a party or by which any of the Sellers, or any of their
respective assets are bound; (c) to Sellers' knowledge, permit the acceleration
of the maturity of any Debt of any of the Acquired Companies or Debt secured by

(collectively, the "MINORITY EQUITY HOLDER RIGHTS"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
Sellers agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
waivers as may be deemed necessary, in Sellers' sole discretion, to prevent any
breach or violation of any confidentiality provisions contained in any Minority
Equity Agreement or any third party agreement as may be caused by the compliance
by Sellers with this SECTION 6.2(a)), (D) provide access to personnel records of
the Acquired Companies relating to individual performance or evaluation records,
medical histories or other similar information regarding specific individuals
which, in Sellers' good faith opinion, is sensitive or the disclosure of which
could subject Sellers or the Acquired Companies to risk of liability under the
terms of any applicable agreement with such specific individuals or applicable
Law, (E) provide such access after normal business hours, (F) provide access to
any marketing strategies or customer segmentation relating to any Acquired
Company which primarily operates in any country in which Purchaser and its
Affiliates own, operate, manage or control any entity which may reasonably be
deemed to compete with such Acquired Company, and (G) provide such access for
more than a reasonable period (which will not, in any event, be more than thirty
(30) days with respect to access to any data room containing documents relating
to any Acquired Company and ten (10) Business Days with respect to all other
information not contained in any data room or any facilities or personnel).
Sellers agree that all such access and information relating to any Acquired
Company other than an Operating Company shall be made available to Purchaser in
Atlanta, Georgia. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that all such access and
information derived therefrom will be deemed Confidential Information subject to
the confidentiality provisions set forth herein and to the Confidentiality
Agreement.

(b) Purchaser may (to the extent not in violation of confidentiality
restrictions, applicable Law or Minority Equity Holder Rights binding upon the
Acquired Companies) pursue a due diligence inquiry with regard to the Acquired
Companies as follows: (i) reviewing documents and other information to be
represented to in the Additional Representations Certificates, including any
documents and information scheduled as exceptions to the representations
contained in any Additional Representations Certificate; it being understood
that (A) the Acquired Companies need not provide any such information that is
not material (with respect to any representations in the Additional
Representations Certificate that contain a specific threshold amount, such
amount shall be considered to be the materiality cut-off) and (B) certain
confidential information required to be kept confidential under any Contract or
applicable Law (such as the names of customers) may be removed, summarized or
otherwise kept confidential and (ii) Seller-organized meetings with the officers
and/or independent auditors of the Acquired Companies, it being understood that
all such meetings shall be coordinated with the Seller Representative and that
the Seller Representative shall have the right to participate in each such

<PAGE>

meeting and/or designate one or more other Person(s) to do so in its place. As
soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Sellers will, subject to
the limitations described in SECTION 6.2(a), contact and direct the Acquired
Companies to prepare for such due diligence inquiries. Purchaser shall have the
right to commence its due diligence inquiry on the date that Seller
Representative delivers the Additional Representations Certificates to Purchaser
and provides Purchaser with access to the important facilities and properties
(the "DUE DILIGENCE COMMENCEMENT DATE"), and thereafter Purchaser will be
permitted to pursue such due diligence through the thirty (30) days commencing
on and immediately following the Due Diligence Commencement Date (the thirtieth
(30th) day following the Due Diligence Commencement Date being the "DUE
DILIGENCE EXPIRATION DATE").

6.3      ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIONS CERTIFICATE.

(a) Subject to the Minority Equity Holder Rights, Sellers shall, and shall cause
each Operating Company set forth in Column 1 of SCHEDULE II, and Intermediate
Holding Company (each, a "CERTIFYING OPERATING COMPANY"), to use best efforts to
deliver to Purchaser within twenty (20) days after the date of this Agreement a
certificate or, at Sellers' discretion, certificates signed by each Seller and
each Certifying Operating Company, setting forth the representations and
warranties contained in EXHIBIT C attached hereto with any exceptions necessary
for Sellers and the Certifying Operating Companies to make such representations
and warranties, which exceptions shall be set forth on schedules attached to
such certificate and with any changes to the actual language of the
representations and warranties contained in EXHIBIT C that any of Sellers' or
the Certifying Operating Companies' local counsel practicing law in any country
in the Territory shall recommend in order to make the actual language of such
representations and warranties contained in EXHIBIT C appropriate for the
Certifying Operating Company (or any Acquired Companies owned by any such
Acquired Company) and any country in the Territory (the "ADDITIONAL
REPRESENTATIONS CERTIFICATE"). Subject to the Minority Equity Holder Rights,
Sellers shall instruct the chief executive officer, president, general manager
or other equivalent officer and the chief financial officer, treasurer,
comptroller or other equivalent officer of each Seller, and to the extent that
any Certifying Operating Company is not a wholly-owned Subsidiary of a Seller,
each such Certifying Operating Acquired Company to execute the Additional
Representations Certificate with respect to or on behalf of such Certifying
Operating Company, which certification will confirm that such officers, in their
capacity as officers, to their knowledge, believe the statements therein to be
true, correct and complete. The representations and warranties made by Sellers
in the Additional Representations Certificate delivered to Purchaser pursuant to
this SECTION 6.3(a) shall be deemed to supplement the representations and
warranties made by Sellers in ARTICLE IV hereof with respect to the Acquired
Companies, and shall be deemed to be representations and warranties of the
Sellers as of the date the Additional Representations Certificate is delivered.

(b) No later than ten (10) days prior to the Due Diligence Expiration Date,
Sellers shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Purchaser a statement setting
forth in reasonable detail Sellers' determination of the amount of the Acquired
Companies Loss Contingencies Reserves and the Acquired Companies' Impairment
Losses ("SELLERS LOSS CONTINGENCIES AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AMOUNT"). No later
than ten (10) Business Days after the Due Diligence Expiration Date, Purchaser
shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Sellers a statement setting forth in
reasonable detail Purchaser's determination of what the amount of the Acquired
Companies Loss

<PAGE>

Contingencies Reserves and the Acquired Companies' Impairment Losses should be,
if measured as of the Due Diligence Expiration Date, accompanied by any
supporting documentation as Sellers may reasonably request ("PURCHASER LOSS
CONTINGENCIES AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AMOUNT"). Within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Purchaser Loss Contingencies and Impairment Losses Amount, the
Seller Representative shall deliver to Purchaser a written statement describing
its objections (if any) to the Purchaser Loss Contingencies and Impairment
Losses Amount. If the Seller Representative does not raise any objections in a
written statement to Purchaser within such thirty (30)-day period, Sellers shall
be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Purchaser Loss Contingencies and
Impairment Losses Amount and the Purchaser Loss Contingencies and Impairment
Losses Amount shall become final, binding and conclusive upon all parties. If
the Seller Representative raises objections in a written statement to Purchaser
within such thirty (30)-day period, the parties shall attempt to resolve their
differences, and any written resolution by them as to the disputed amount shall
be final, binding and conclusive. If the parties cannot resolve such objection
within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt by Purchaser of such written
statement, any remaining disputes shall be resolved by Ernst & Young LLP, or if
Ernst & Young LLP declines such engagement, by another internationally
recognized independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Purchaser and
Sellers (the "CONTINGENCY FIRM"). The Contingency Firm shall be instructed to
resolve such disputes within thirty (30) days after its appointment. The
determination by the Contingency Firm shall be set forth in writing and shall be
conclusive and binding upon all parties and shall be deemed to be the "FINAL
LOSS CONTINGENCIES AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AMOUNT". The fees and expenses of the
Contingency Firm shall be borne by Sellers and Purchaser on a 50/50 basis. In
the event that the Final Loss Contingencies and Impairment Losses Amount is
greater than the Sellers Loss Contingencies and Impairment Losses Amount, then
Purchaser shall be entitled to make a claim for indemnification pursuant to
SECTION 10.2(a)(iv) for the amount by which the Final Loss Contingencies and
Impairment Losses Amount exceeds the Sellers Loss Contingencies and Impairment
Losses Amount (such amount, the "LOSS CONTINGENCY AND IMPAIRMENT LOSSES
SHORTFALL").

6.4      PRESERVATION OF BUSINESS.

(a) Except as provided or contemplated by this Agreement, including
SECTIONS 6.4(b), 6.4(c) and 6.4(d), and as provided in the Minority Equity

prudent business judgment. From and after the date hereof, Sellers will provide
to Purchaser a monthly management report describing the performance of such
Operating Company, including in relation to the 2004 Budget, which Purchaser
agrees and acknowledges will be Confidential Information subject to the
confidentiality provisions set forth herein and in the Confidentiality
Agreement. Sellers or the Acquired Companies make no representations or
warranties, whether express or implied, as to the performance of, or any
projections, forecasts or forward-looking statements relating to, any Acquired
Company and there is no assurance that any projection or forecast results will
be achieved. In addition, from and after the date of this Agreement until the

         in the adjustments provided for in SECTION 2.4, (2) in connection with
         any Lien arising in the ordinary course, (3) in connection with any
         intercompany transfers among the Acquired Companies and/or the Holding

through the applicable Closing Date with respect to such Acquired Company except
to the extent previously agreed to by such Seller with any third party.

(d) From the date of this Agreement through the applicable Closing Date with

(f) Subject to the provisions of the Minority Equity Agreements, any Minority
Equity Holder Rights and any Rights of First Refusal, from the date hereof until
the applicable Closing Date, with respect to any Acquired Company, Sellers shall

6.5      CONSENTS AND APPROVALS.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Final Closing Date, each Seller
shall, and, subject to applicable Law and the Minority Equity Holder Rights,
shall cause each Acquired Company until, (i) with respect to any Initial
Acquired Company or any Subsequent Acquired Company, the applicable Closing
Date, (ii) with respect to any Retained Company, the applicable Retained Company
Determination Date, (iii) with respect to any Section 6.29 Retained Company, the
applicable Section 6.29 Retained Company Determination Date and (iv) with
respect to any ROFR Company, the applicable ROFR Determination Date, to use its
best efforts to obtain all consents, approvals, certificates and other documents
required in connection with the performance by it of this Agreement and its
Related Agreements and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. From the date of this Agreement until the Final Closing
Date, Purchaser shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use

<PAGE>

best efforts to obtain all consents, approvals, certificates and other documents
required in connection with the performance by it of this Agreement and its
Related Agreements and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. Each Seller shall and, subject to applicable Law and the
Minority Equity Holder Rights, shall cause each Acquired Company to, promptly
make all filings, applications, statements and reports to all Governmental
Authorities and other Persons that are required to be made prior to the
applicable Closing Date with respect to such Acquired Company by or on behalf of
Sellers or the Acquired Companies pursuant to any applicable Law (including
Required Regulatory Approvals) or Contract in connection with this Agreement,
its Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
Purchaser (A) shall promptly (and in any event, within ten (10) Business Days
following the date of this Agreement) notify Seller of all filings,
applications, statements and reports to all Governmental Authorities and other
Persons that are required to be made prior to the Initial Closing Date or any
Subsequent Closing Date by or on behalf of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
pursuant to any applicable Law (including Required Regulatory Approvals) or
Contract in connection with this Agreement, its Related Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and (B) shall promptly make, or
cause its Subsidiaries to make, all such filings, applications, statements and
reports.

(b) In addition to Purchaser's obligations pursuant to SECTION 6.5(a), Purchaser
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use best efforts to obtain as soon
as practicable the Required Regulatory Approvals. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate with
one another: (i) in the prompt preparation and filing (as soon as practicable
and in any event no later than thirty (30) days after the date of this
Agreement) of any and all instruments, agreements or other documents required to
be filed in connection with any Required Regulatory Approvals; (ii) in
determining whether action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required, proper or advisable or any actions, consents, waivers or
approvals are required to be obtained from parties to any Contracts in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) in
keeping the other party apprised of communications to or from Governmental
Authorities; with respect to the submission, prosecution or obtaining of the
Required Regulatory Approvals; (iv) in the prompt notification and meeting with
any appropriate Governmental Authority; and (v) in seeking timely to obtain any
such actions, consents or waivers or to make any such filings subject with
respect to each of clause (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), in the case of Sellers, to
the Minority Equity Holder Rights. No party hereto shall (and Purchaser shall
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to) consummate another transaction or enter
into an agreement with respect to another transaction or take any other action
if the intent or reasonably anticipated consequence of such transaction or
action is, or would be, to cause any Governmental Authority not to grant
approval of any Required Regulatory Approval or materially delay either such
approval or the consummation of the assignment or transfer of control of the
Communications Licenses. In addition, if required by a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction, Purchaser shall and, if applicable, shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, take or accept one or more Actions of Divestiture in order to
resolve with the minimum practicable delay any objections such authority may
have to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under applicable Laws;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser shall not be required to take or accept (or
cause any of its Subsidiaries to take or accept) any such Actions of Divestiture
with regard to the Argentinian Acquired Company or the Chilean Acquired Company
if the Action of Divestiture Fair Value of all of the Actions of Divestiture
required by any final and nonappealable Governmental Order in connection with
the Argentinian

<PAGE>

Acquired Company and the Chilean Acquired Company exceeds, in the aggregate, the
threshold set forth in SCHEDULE 6.5(b) (the "ACTION OF DIVESTITURE THRESHOLD");
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, in each case, any adverse economic consequences with
respect to any synergies, cost reductions or benefits from (or any synergies,
cost reductions or benefits expected or anticipated to result from) from the
combination or consolidation of Purchaser and its Affiliates with one or more
Acquired Companies and its businesses and operations shall be disregarded in
connection with such determination. For the avoidance of doubt, in addition to
Purchaser's obligations set forth in the preceding sentence, with respect to the
Argentinian Acquired Company and the Chilean Acquired Company, Purchaser shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take all steps necessary to obtain as soon
as practicable the Required Regulatory Approvals and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the purchase of the
Sellers Equity Interests in the Argentinian Acquired Company and the Chilean
Acquired Company), which steps shall include taking or accepting any and all
Actions of Divestiture requested by any Governmental Authority with respect to
the Argentinian Acquired Company and the Chilean Acquired Company to the extent
that the Action of Divestiture Fair Value of such Actions of Divestiture does
not exceed, in the aggregate, the Action of Divestiture Threshold; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that in the event the Action of Divestiture Fair Value of such Actions
of Divestiture required by final and nonappealable Governmental Orders would
exceed, in the aggregate, the Action of Divestiture Threshold, subject to
Purchaser's obligations set forth in the next sentence, Purchaser shall have no
obligation to take or accept Actions of Divestiture with respect to either the
Argentinian Acquired Company or the Chilean Acquired Company and shall have no
obligation to purchase the Sellers Equity Interests in either the Argentinian
Acquired Company or the Chilean Acquired Company, PROVIDED that, in such event,
Purchaser may, at its option, elect to take or accept the required Actions of
Divestiture in connection with, and purchase the Sellers Equity Interests of,
either or both of the Argentinian Acquired Company or the Chilean Acquired
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
in the event that the Action of Divestiture Fair Value of the Actions of
Divestiture required by any Governmental Order with respect to the Argentinian
Acquired Company and the Chilean Acquired Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement exceeds, in the aggregate, the
Action of Divestiture Threshold, Purchaser and Sellers agree that they shall
nonetheless use best efforts to appeal such requests and/or Governmental Orders
(including taking any and all actions contemplated by SECTION 6.29(a)) in order
to eliminate the Actions of Divestiture and/or reduce the Action of Divestiture
Fair Value with respect to such Actions of Divestiture below the Action of
Divestiture Threshold.

(c) As soon as practicable but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
following the date upon which the parties reasonably determine in good faith
that the Governmental Authorities in Argentina and Chile have issued final and
nonappealable Governmental Orders determining all Actions of Divestiture, if
any, required to be taken or accepted in connection with the Argentinian
Acquired Company and the Chilean Acquired Company, in the event that Purchaser
claims or asserts that such Actions of Divestiture have an Action of Divestiture
Fair Value that would exceed, in the aggregate, the Action of Divestiture
Threshold, the parties shall retain the Valuation Firm and instruct the
Valuation Firm to determine the Action of Divestiture Fair Value of all such
required Actions of Divestiture no later than the date which is thirty (30) days
after the date of such Valuation Firm's retention. The Valuation Firm's final
determination of the Action of Divestiture Fair Value shall be set forth in a
detailed written report that describes the methodology, procedures and
assumptions used in making such determination

<PAGE>

(which methodology, procedures and assumptions shall be consistent with the
applicable terms of this Agreement), and such determination shall be conclusive
and binding upon all parties. The parties agree to promptly provide to the
Valuation Firm all information reasonably requested by the Valuation Firm to
assist it in making such determination. The fees and expenses of the Valuation
Firm shall be shared equally between Sellers and Purchaser.

(d) In the event that, solely with respect to the Argentinian Acquired Company
and the Chilean Acquired Company, an Action of Divestiture is not required to be
taken or accepted pursuant to SECTION 6.5(b), because the Action of Divestiture
Fair Value of the required Actions of Divestiture exceeds, in the aggregate, the
Action of Divestiture Threshold, then each of the Argentinian Acquired Company
and the Chilean Acquired Company shall be deemed to be a "RETAINED COMPANY"
(unless and to the extent Purchaser elects to take or accept all required
Actions of Divestiture in connection with either or both of the Argentinian
Acquired Company or the Chilean Acquired Company notwithstanding the fact that
the Action of Divestiture Threshold has been exceeded and, following the
applicable Retained Company Determination Date, (i) the parties shall
nevertheless be obligated to consummate the Initial Closing and any Subsequent
Closing and the other transactions contemplated pursuant to this Agreement
except with respect to any such Retained Company (or any Section 6.29 Retained
Company or ROFR Company), (ii) the applicable Seller will retain and continue to
hold and own its Seller Equity Interests or Holding Company Equity Interests
relating to, and any Sellers Stockholder Debt with regard to, any such Retained
Company, (iii) the Sellers Equity Interests of any such Retained Company shall
be deemed to be excluded from the definition of "Sellers Equity Interests" and
"Holding Company Equity Interests" for all purposes of this Agreement and (iv)
no representations or warranties shall be deemed to have been made by Sellers
with respect to any such Retained Company. For the avoidance of doubt, from and
after the Retained Company Determination Date with respect to any Retained
Company, SECTIONS 6.5 and 6.6 and ARTICLE III, as well as any other provisions
that would otherwise reasonably be interpreted to treat such Retained Company as
an Acquired Company whose Sellers Equity Interests are being transferred
directly or indirectly pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will no longer be applicable to such Retained Company; PROVIDED, that
SECTIONS 6.8 and 6.28, as well as the Confidentiality Agreement, will continue
to be applicable to all Retained Companies.

6.6      APPLICATIONS IN RESPECT OF COMMUNICATIONS LICENSES. Notwithstanding the
general timing requirements set forth in SECTION 6.5(b), as promptly as
practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and in any event
within thirty (30) Days thereafter, Purchaser shall (or shall cause one or more
of its Subsidiaries to) prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative
Purchaser's completed portion of all appropriate applications for approval by
each relevant Governmental Authority, and such other documents as may be
required, with respect to the assignment or transfer of control of each of the
Communications Licenses, the Network Facilities and/or the Acquired Companies
(collectively, the "LICENSE APPLICATIONS"). As promptly as practicable after its
receipt thereof, and in any event within thirty (30) Days thereafter, Sellers
shall, subject to the Minority Equity Holder Rights, cause each Acquired Company
to prepare and deliver to Purchaser its completed portion of all appropriate
License Applications. As soon as practicable after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the parties shall file, or cause to be filed, the License
Applications, subject, in the case of the Sellers, to the Minority Equity Holder
Rights. If an Initial Closing or any Subsequent Closing shall not have occurred
for any reason within any applicable initial consummation period set forth in
the

<PAGE>

grant of the License Applications with respect to any Initial Acquired Company
or Subsequent Acquired Company, and neither Sellers nor Purchaser shall have
terminated this Agreement prior to the Initial Closing Date pursuant to
ARTICLE IX, Purchaser and Sellers (or the applicable Initial Acquired Company or
the applicable Subsequent Acquired Company) shall jointly request one or more
extensions of the consummation period set forth in such grant.

6.7      ACQUIRED COMPANY DEBT; INTERCOMPANY DEBT; INTERCOMPANY PAYABLES.

Acquired Company prior to or at the Initial Closing and (ii) each Subsequent
Acquired Company that is the subject of a Subsequent Closing, if any, prior to
or at the applicable Subsequent Closing; PROVIDED, that if any Pay-Off Debt that

obligations of the BellSouth Entities with respect to such Pay-Off Debt shall be
terminated in full by no later than the applicable Closing.

(b) Purchaser agrees to cause the Acquired Companies to satisfy, pay, discharge

an Initial Acquired Company and (ii) Intercompany Debt of each Subsequent
Acquired Company that is the subject of a Subsequent Closing, if any, prior to
or at the Subsequent Closing to the extent the creditor under the Intercompany
Debt is not an Initial Acquired Company or a Subsequent Acquired Company that is
the subject of such Subsequent Closing or any earlier Subsequent Closing;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event any such Initial Acquired Company or any
such Subsequent Acquired Company does not have the funds necessary to satisfy,
pay, or discharge the amounts due and payable with respect to such Intercompany
Debt or is otherwise prohibited from satisfying, paying or discharging such
amounts as a result of any senior Debt, then Purchaser shall satisfy, pay,
discharge or otherwise cause to be satisfied, paid or discharged any such
amounts payable pursuant to this SECTION 6.7(b).

(c) Sellers agree to cause any Non-Transferred Company to satisfy, pay,
discharge or otherwise cause to be satisfied, paid, or discharged the full

that is payable to any Initial Acquired Company prior to or at the Initial
Closing, (ii) Intercompany Debt of each Non-Transferred Company (that has been
deemed to be a Non-Transferred Company prior to or at any Subsequent Closing)

Debt of each Non-Transferred Company (that was not deemed to be a
Non-Transferred Company prior to or at the Initial Closing or any Subsequent
Closing) that is payable to an Acquired Company no later than ten (10) Business
Days after the determination that such entity is a Non-Transferred Company;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event any such Non-Transferred Company does not
have the funds necessary to satisfy, pay or discharge the amounts due and
payable with respect to such Intercompany Debt or is otherwise prohibited from
satisfying, paying or discharging such amounts as a result of any

<PAGE>

senior Debt, then Sellers shall purchase the Intercompany Debt Receivable from
the applicable Acquired Company.

(d) Prior to or at the Initial Closing, (i) each Initial Acquired Company will
pay in cash the full amount of all Intercompany Payables of such Initial
Acquired Company that are payable to any Acquired Company (other than an Initial
Acquired Company) and (ii) each Acquired Company (other than an Initial Acquired
Company) will pay in cash the full amount of all Intercompany Payables of such
Acquired Company that are payable to any Initial Acquired Company. Prior to or
at any Subsequent Closing, (A) each Subsequent Acquired Company will pay in cash
the full amount of all Intercompany Payables of such Subsequent Acquired Company
that are payable to any Acquired Company (other than any Initial Acquired
Company or any Subsequent Acquired Company that is the subject of the same
Subsequent Closing) and (B) each Acquired Company (other than an Initial
Acquired Company or any Subsequent Acquired Company that is the subject of such
Subsequent Closing) will pay in cash the full amount of all Intercompany
Payables of such Acquired Company that are payable to any Subsequent Acquired

(e) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement or directed by
Sellers in their sole discretion, Sellers will cause to be paid on or prior to
the Initial Closing Date, or any Subsequent Closing Date, if applicable, any and
all amounts owed or payable as of such Closing by any Initial Acquired Company
or Subsequent Acquired Company to any BellSouth Entity, including any amounts
payable pursuant to SECTIONS 6.10 and 6.13 or pursuant to the Technical Services
Agreements; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event any such Initial Acquired
Company or any such Subsequent Acquired Company does not have the funds
necessary to satisfy, pay, or discharge the amounts due and payable to any
BellSouth Entity or is otherwise prohibited from satisfying, paying or
discharging such amounts as a result of any Debt or other restriction, then
Purchaser shall satisfy, pay, discharge or otherwise cause to be satisfied, paid
or discharged any such amounts payable pursuant to this SECTION 6.7(e). In
addition, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement or directed
by Purchaser in its sole discretion, Seller Parent will cause any BellSouth
Entity to pay on or prior to the Initial Closing Date, or any Subsequent Closing
Date, if applicable, any and all amounts owed by the BellSouth Entities to any
such Initial Acquired Company or any such Subsequently Acquired Company,
including any amounts payable pursuant to SECTIONS 6.10 or 6.13 or pursuant to
the Technical Services Agreement.

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the access and information being provided to it
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is subject to
the terms of the Information Exchange Agreement, dated May 22, 2003, between
Seller Parent and Purchaser (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), the terms of

Affiliates and their Representatives to, keep confidential and not disclose all

other requirements of applicable Law or any Governmental Authority (including in
connection with obtaining the necessary approvals of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby of Governmental Authorities).

(b) Effective upon, and only upon, the Final Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate with respect to information relating solely to the
Acquired Companies; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser acknowledges that any and
all other information provided to it by Sellers or Sellers' representatives
concerning Sellers and their Affiliates shall remain subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Final Closing and
Purchaser and each of the Acquired Companies shall be subject to a Technical
Information Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated for any reason, promptly (but
in any event no later than five (5) Business Days) following such termination,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, (i) return to Sellers
all Confidential Information (and all copies, reproductions or extracts of
Confidential Information) furnished to Purchaser and Purchaser's Representatives
by or on behalf of Sellers or the Acquired Companies or have an executive
officer of Purchaser certify to Sellers that all copies, reproductions or
extracts have been destroyed and (ii) destroy all Confidential Information
prepared by Purchaser or Purchaser's Representatives that contains, or reflects
or is based upon, in whole or in part, information furnished to Purchaser or
Purchaser's Representatives by or on behalf of Sellers or the Acquired

solely to the extent reasonably required to support the basis for such
termination. Such destruction shall be certified in writing to the Seller
Representative by each of an executive officer of Purchaser and an authorized
officer of Purchaser supervising such destruction. Notwithstanding the return or

Representatives will continue to be bound by the obligations of confidentiality

Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and/or (ii) any Acquired Company

any event no later than five (5) Business Days) following the determination that
any such Acquired Company has become a Retained Company, a Section 6.29 Retained
Company or a ROFR Company, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, (i) return to Sellers all Confidential Information relating to any such
Retained Company, Section 6.29 Retained Company or ROFR Company (and all copies,
reproductions or extracts of such Confidential Information) furnished to
Purchaser and Purchaser's Representatives by or on behalf of Sellers or any
Retained Company, Section 6.29 Retained Company or ROFR Company and (ii) destroy

the Confidentiality Agreement.

(e) For a two (2) year period commencing on the applicable Closing Date with
respect to each Acquired Company, each of the applicable Seller, Seller Parent
and the BellSouth Entities will, and will use best efforts to cause their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors to, maintain in
confidence and not use for any purpose any confidential information, whether
written or oral, which was obtained from or on behalf of such Acquired Company

Business as carried on by the Acquired Companies, nor any of the technical
information, trade secrets or know-how belonging to such Acquired Companies,

acceptable to Purchaser, effective immediately after the applicable Closing, of
all directors (or equivalent decision-making Persons) of the Acquired Companies
that are the subject of the applicable Closing who are officers or employees of
any BellSouth Entity, but not employees of such Acquired Companies and shall
take such other action as is necessary to accomplish the foregoing. In
connection therewith, Sellers shall cause any such resigning directors to return
or transfer any director qualifying or similar shares in relation to any such
Acquired Company to the relevant Acquired Company or any other person designated
in writing by Purchaser.

6.10     NO FURTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. Purchaser acknowledges that in the
course of conduct by the Acquired Companies of their respective businesses, the
BellSouth Entities have entered into, or, between the date of this Agreement and
the Final Closing Date, may enter into, various arrangements in which (a)
guarantees or similar obligations were issued by one or more of the BellSouth
Entities and/or (b) one or more of the BellSouth Entities is the primary
obligor(s) on other agreements, in any such case to support or facilitate
business transactions or programs of the Acquired Companies. The arrangements
referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b) are hereinafter referred to as
the "BELLSOUTH GUARANTEES". The BellSouth Guarantees that are in existence as of
the date hereof (or that, as of the date hereof, are contemplated to be put in
place at a later date) are set forth on SCHEDULE 6.10. As of the applicable
Closing, Purchaser will either cause the BellSouth Guarantees relating to the
Acquired Company that is the subject of such Closing to be terminated so that
the BellSouth Entities will be released and discharged from

<PAGE>

any further obligations or liabilities thereunder or, if Purchaser is unable to
obtain such releases, Purchaser will cause the Debt related to the BellSouth
Guarantees to be prepaid and such BellSouth Guarantees to be canceled.

6.11     BROKERS. For the avoidance of doubt, regardless of whether the Initial
Closing shall occur, (a) Sellers shall indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates
against, and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless from, any and all
liability for any brokers' or finders' fees or other commissions arising with
respect to brokers or finders retained or engaged by Sellers or any of their
Affiliates in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b)
Purchaser shall indemnify Sellers and their Affiliates against, and hold Sellers
and their Affiliates harmless from, any and all liability for any brokers' or
finders' fees or other commissions arising with respect to brokers or finders
retained or engaged by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.12     PRESERVATION OF BOOKS AND RECORDS; ACCESS.

(a) For a period of seven years after the Final Closing Date or such other
period required by applicable Law, Purchaser shall preserve and retain, or cause
the Initial Acquired Companies and the Subsequent Acquired Companies, if any, to
preserve and retain, all corporate, accounting, legal, auditing, human resources
and other books and records of each applicable Acquired Company (including any
documents relating to any governmental or non-governmental claims, actions,
suits, proceedings or investigations) relating to the conduct of the business
and operations of the particular Initial Acquired Company or Subsequent Acquired
Company prior to the applicable Closing Date for such Acquired Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, during such seven-year period, Purchaser may
dispose of any such books and records which are offered to, but not accepted by,
the Seller Representative. If at any time after such seven-year period Purchaser
intends to dispose of any such books and records, Purchaser shall not do so
without first offering such books and records to the Seller Representative. The
provisions of this SECTION 6.12(a) shall cease to apply in the event of a sale
or disposition of any Acquired Company by Purchaser; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
Purchaser shall cause the subsequent owner(s) of such Acquired Company to assume
the obligations of Purchaser set forth in this SECTION 6.12.

(b) After the applicable Closing Date, subject to any confidentiality provision
of any Minority Equity Agreement that continues in existence following the
applicable Closing Date (PROVIDED, that Purchaser agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such waivers as Purchaser may deem necessary to
prevent any breach or violation of any confidentiality provisions contained in
any such Minority Equity Agreement as may be caused by the compliance by
Purchaser with this SECTION 6.12(b)), Purchaser shall cause each Initial
Acquired Company and Subsequent Acquired Company, if any, to permit Sellers and
their Representatives to have reasonable access to, and to inspect at Sellers'
expense, all books and records referred to in SECTION 6.12(a) in the event of
any litigation, arbitration or dispute or any threatened litigation, arbitration
or dispute, insurance matters, tax filings, accounting and financial reporting
of the Sellers and their Affiliates, and to meet with officers and employees of
Purchaser and any such Acquired Company as may reasonably be requested by
Sellers on a mutually convenient basis in order to obtain explanations with
respect to such books and records and to obtain additional information and to
call such officers and employees as witnesses.

<PAGE>

(c) The parties agree and confirm that to the extent the books and records
described in this SECTION 6.12 relate to Seller Parent and do not fall under the
exceptions described in SECTION 6.8(a)(i), (ii) or (iii), such books and records
shall be deemed the Confidential Information of Seller Parent and shall be
within the Seller Parent Confidential Information covered by the Technical
Information Confidentiality Agreements.

6.13     EMPLOYEES; EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

(a) Purchaser shall cause each of the Initial Acquired Companies and Subsequent
Acquired Companies, if any, to employ on the applicable Closing Date or continue
to employ on the applicable Closing Date all of the employees of such Acquired
Company (as applied to any such Acquired Company, "CONTINUING EMPLOYEES") on
terms and conditions of employment, including pay levels, job descriptions and
benefits, that are substantially similar in all material respects either (i) to
the terms and conditions of employment immediately prior to the Closing Date or
(ii) to the terms and conditions of employment that apply to similarly situated
employees of Purchaser. The foregoing covenant of Purchaser shall not restrict
or limit in any manner Purchaser's management of the business of the Initial
Acquired Companies or Subsequent Acquired Companies, if any, after the
applicable Closing nor require Purchaser to retain any Continuing Employee for
any period of time after the applicable Closing Date or to maintain any
particular pay levels, job descriptions or benefits or other terms and
conditions of employment for them; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser shall be
responsible for any and all notices, liabilities, costs, payments and expenses
arising from any action by Purchaser (including breach of contract, defamation
or retaliatory discharge) regarding any employee of an Initial Acquired Company
or Subsequent Acquired Company, if any, or any Continuing Employee, including
any such liability (i) under any applicable Law that relates to employees,
employee benefit matters or labor matters, (ii) for dismissal, wrongful
termination or constructive dismissal or termination, or severance pay or other
termination pay, or (iii) under or with respect to any benefit plan, program,
contract, policy, commitment or arrangement of the Acquired Companies, including
the Retention Plans maintained by the Acquired Companies (collectively,
"EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS") or under and with respect to the Retention Plans
(other than those maintained by the Acquired Companies) to the extent such
Retention Plans provide payments or benefits with respect to any Continuing
Employee; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser shall not be responsible for any
costs, payments or expenses under or with respect to the Retention Plans to the
extent that such costs, payments and/or expenses exceed, in the aggregate,

pursuant to the terms of the Retention Plans.

(b) Prior to the applicable Closing Date, Purchaser may notify Seller Parent
that Purchaser desires to make employment offers, effective as of the applicable
Closing Date, to certain identified employees of the BellSouth Entities who
provide services with respect to any Initial Acquired Company or Subsequent
Acquired Company, if any, and shall provide Seller Parent with a list of such
individuals. If Seller Parent consents thereto, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, Purchaser shall be entitled to make such offers of
employment and Seller Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliates to,
provide Purchaser with reasonable access to such employees for purposes of
making the employment offers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any employee for whom
Purchaser desires to make an employment offer also provides services with
respect to any Acquired Company that is not the subject of the Initial Closing
or any Subsequent Closing, Sellers Parent's refusal to consent to such
employment offer shall not

<PAGE>

be deemed unreasonable. Any person who accepts Purchaser's offer of employment
made pursuant to this subsection (b) shall be treated as a Continuing Employee
for purposes of this SECTION 6.13.

(c) Subject to SECTION 6.5(d), after the applicable Closing Date, Sellers shall
be responsible for all relocation costs arising as a result of returning to
their home country any expatriates or impatriates (other than those who are
Continuing Employees) who, immediately prior to the applicable Closing Date,
provide services to an Acquired Company that is the subject of a Closing Date,
including severance payments. The applicable Acquired Company agrees to honor,
perform and be liable for, and, to the extent necessary, assume, all
obligations, if any, with respect to retention bonuses under the Retention Plans
payable to or on behalf of those persons described in the preceding sentence,
including, for this purpose, those persons who are Continuing Employees.

(d) After the applicable Closing Date, Purchaser agrees that each Initial
Acquired Company or Subsequent Acquired Company, if any, or Purchaser shall
honor, pay, perform and be liable for and, to the extent applicable, shall
assume, (i) all obligations and liabilities under and with respect to all
Employee Benefit Plans, (ii) all benefits and payments to, or with respect to,
employees or former employees required under applicable Law, including the
workers' compensation and other obligations of such Acquired Company under labor
and employment Laws, (iii) all Tax equalization, reimbursements, retention and
similar charges and costs, and all other liabilities related to expatriates who,
at the direction of the BellSouth Entities, worked for or provided services to
such Acquired Companies (including all liabilities and obligations for retention
bonuses under the Retention Plans) and (iv) all liabilities and obligations
under and with respect to the employment agreements set forth on SCHEDULE
6.13(d). If Sellers pay any amounts described in clause (iii) of this SECTION
6.13(d), Purchaser shall, or shall cause the applicable Acquired Company for
which the expatriate provided services immediately prior to the applicable
Closing Date to, reimburse Sellers for such amounts.

(e) It is understood and agreed that all provisions contained in this Agreement
with respect to employee benefit plans or employee compensation are included for
the sole benefit of the respective parties hereto and do not and shall not
create any right in any other Person, including any participant in any Employee
Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit or compensation plan or any
beneficiary thereof or any employee or former employee of any Initial Acquired
Company or Subsequent Acquired Company, if any.

6.14     LITIGATION CONTROL AND COOPERATION. Purchaser agrees that with respect
to any litigation matters with respect to which Sellers and their Affiliates are
subject or liable, Sellers and their Affiliates shall continue to control the
prosecution, defense and/or settlement and all other administrative aspects
thereof following the applicable Closing Date with respect to which an Acquired
Company is involved in any such litigation matter, including the Venezuelan
Arbitration, the Peruvian Arbitration and the matter referred to in SECTION
10.2(a)(viii) (collectively the "LITIGATION MATTERS"), Purchaser will promptly
provide, and cause all applicable Acquired Companies to provide, all support and
cooperation reasonably requested by Sellers in connection with any claims,
counterclaims, defenses, settlements, compromises or other actions with regard
to such Litigation Matters and any related claims, suits, actions or proceedings
(PROVIDED that Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser for Purchaser's reasonable and
documented out-

<PAGE>

of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with providing such support
and cooperation), including (a) providing access to the books, records,
documents and information of the Acquired Companies and their respective
Affiliates, as provided in more detail in SECTION 6.12, (b) providing for full
access and availability of their officers, employees, representatives, agents
and other personnel, including instructing and causing them to comply with this
SECTION 6.14 and to be available to provide interviews, testimony, affidavits

SECTION 6.14, (c) entering into confidentiality, joint defense or similar
agreements with Sellers and/or their Affiliates and (d) entering into, executing
or acknowledging any compromises, settlements or other resolutions of the
Litigation Matters, so long as such resolutions do not require Purchaser or any
Affiliate to agree to, or impose on Purchaser or any Affiliate, any restrictions
on their business activities or pay damages or suffer other financial
consequences not fully indemnified by Sellers.

6.15     LIABILITY INSURANCE; DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INSURANCE.

(a) During the five (5) year period following the applicable Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause each Acquired Company to continue to maintain product
liability insurance, workers' compensation insurance, employer's liability
insurance and other liability insurance (on an occurrence basis) in amounts and
with coverage substantially similar to that maintained by such Acquired Company
or by any Affiliate of such Acquired Company on behalf of such Acquired Company
prior to the applicable Closing Date. Purchaser shall cause all policies for
such insurance to include a waiver by the insurer of any subrogation rights
against Sellers and their Affiliates.

(b) For a period of five (5) years from the applicable Closing Date, Purchaser
shall cause each Acquired Company: (i) to maintain run-off directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies for the past and current officers and
directors of such Acquired Company who are employees or attorneys (in their
capacity as agent) of any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller or of any
Minority Equity Holder that sells its Minority Equity Interests to Purchaser
directly or indirectly in accordance with this Agreement on the applicable
Closing Date or who were employees of any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller
at any time prior to the applicable Closing Date with terms and coverage amounts
at least as favorable as the terms and coverage amounts of the directors' and
officers' insurance, if, and only to the extent that, any such policy exists on
the date of this Agreement, applicable to such past and current officers and
directors as of the date hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser or any
Acquired Company shall not be required to pay an annual premium in excess of the
last annual premium paid by the Sellers or such Acquired Company prior to the
date hereof and, if Purchaser or such Acquired Company is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this SECTION 6.15, it shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for the annual premium equal to such maximum amount and
(ii) not to amend any Acquired Company Organizational Documents relating to such
Acquired Company in any way to reduce or eliminate the level of indemnification
provided by such Acquired Company to such past and current officers and
directors of such Acquired Company.

6.16     SUPPORT SERVICES. Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers shall have no
obligation to provide any support or other services to any Initial Acquired
Company or Subsequent Acquired Company as of the applicable Closing with respect
to such Initial Acquired Company or Subsequent Acquired Company, other than
transition services, subject to such related terms,

<PAGE>

conditions, fees, reimbursements and other provisions as Purchaser and Sellers
will discuss and negotiate in a good faith and reasonable manner, taking
appropriate consideration of the practices and requirements of the Business, and
which will be reflected in a transition services agreement, reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance, to Purchaser and Sellers, and finally agreed
by them by the Due Diligence Expiration Date, at which time, such transition
services agreement (the "TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT") will be deemed to be
part of this Agreement and will be entered into by the parties at such
applicable Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser
acknowledges that the Transition Services Agreement shall provide that (a) for
any period during which a person provides services pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement, Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers or their Affiliates for
all costs incurred by Sellers or their Affiliates with respect to the continuing
employment of such person, including, but not limited to, benefit costs and
contributions, fringe rates, wages, bonuses, vacation pay, employment taxes, and
if any person who provides services pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement is covered by a Retention Plan, Purchaser shall be obligated for
reimbursing Sellers and their Affiliates under the Transition Services Agreement
for all costs and expenses incurred by Sellers or their Affiliates under the
Retention Plan and (b) Sellers and their Affiliates shall be indemnified and
held harmless from any and all Losses arising out of or related to the services
provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement or the continued
employment of persons providing services thereunder, including any services
provided by expatriates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
SECTION 6.16, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to retain the
employees that are to provide the services under the Transition Services
Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if Sellers are not able to retain one or more
employees necessary to provide any service under the Transition Services
Agreement, then Sellers shall not be responsible for providing such service or
services as provided in the Transition Services Agreement. In addition, the
Transition Services Agreement shall grant licenses to Seller Parent for software
or technology that is owned by an Acquired Company and which Seller Parent
identifies within twenty (20) days of the date hereof as being useful for the
Seller Parent or any Subsidiary or Affiliate after the applicable Closing Date;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Acquired Company, Subsidiary of an Acquired Company
nor Purchaser or any of its Affiliates shall be responsible for payment of any
penalties resulting from early termination of such agreements.

6.17     SELLER PARENT MARKS. Purchaser agrees that it shall cause each of the
Initial Acquired Companies and, if any, Subsequent Acquired Companies to enter
into the Transition Trademark License Agreement at the applicable Closing for
such Acquired Company. Pursuant to the Transition Trademark License Agreement,
Purchaser shall cause each of the applicable Acquired Companies to: (a) as soon
as practicable after the applicable Closing Date, but in no event later than one
hundred and eighty (180) days following the applicable Closing Date, cease to
make any use of the Seller Parent Marks, (b) immediately after the applicable
Closing Date, cease to hold itself out as having any affiliation with any Seller
or Affiliates of Sellers, and (c) as soon as practicable after the applicable
Closing Date, but in no event later than ninety (90) days following the

any of the Seller Parent Marks, change its corporate name to a corporate name
that does not include any of the Seller Parent Marks and make any necessary
legal filings with the appropriate Governmental Authority, as the case may be,
to effect such change. In furtherance of the foregoing, as promptly as
practicable after each Closing Date, but in no event later than the applicable
time limits set forth in the applicable Transition Trademark License Agreement,
Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies that are the subject of such
Closing to remove,

<PAGE>

strike over, permanently cover or otherwise obliterate all Seller Parent Marks
from all materials owned by such Acquired Company, including, vehicles, business
cards, schedules, stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional
materials, manuals, forms, computer software and other materials. For all
removed materials which bear a Seller Parent Mark, Purchaser shall cause the
Acquired Company owning such materials to either promptly return to Seller
Parent or destroy such materials in accordance with written instructions from
Seller Parent, which instructions shall be requested by the Acquired Company on
a case-by-case basis covering specific types of material bearing Seller Parent
Marks. The Initial Acquired Companies and the Subsequent Acquired Companies, if
any, shall be solely responsible for any costs incurred in connection with
compliance with this SECTION 6.17.

6.18     SELLER PARENT TECHNICAL INFORMATION. Purchaser, Seller Parent and the
Initial Acquired Companies and any Subsequent Acquired Companies will enter into
a technical information confidentiality agreement, including such related terms,
conditions, fees, reimbursements and other provisions as Purchaser and Sellers
will discuss and negotiate in a good faith and reasonable manner, taking
appropriate consideration of the practices and requirements of the Business, and
which will be reflected in a technical information confidentiality agreement,
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance, to Purchaser and Sellers, and
finally agreed by them by the Due Diligence Expiration Date, at which time, such
agreement (the "TECHNICAL INFORMATION CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT") will be deemed
to be part of this Agreement and will be entered into by the applicable parties
at the Initial Closing. Pursuant to the Technical Information Confidentiality
Agreement, Purchaser agrees that it shall cause each of Initial Acquired Company
and Subsequent Acquired Company, if any, to: (a) as soon as practicable after
the applicable Closing Date, cease to make any use of the Seller Parent
Technical Information; (b) while taking steps to achieve cessation of use of the
Seller Parent Technical Information, ensure any continuing use is limited to
internal use on a strictly "need to know" basis within the Acquired Companies;
(c) immediately after the applicable Closing Date, cease to make any further
disclosures of the Seller Parent Technical Information to third parties or
employees not already in possession of such information except on an as-needed
basis and in conformity with the provisions of SECTION 6.8; and (d) as soon as
practicable after the applicable Closing Date with respect to any Initial
Acquired Company or Subsequent Acquired Company, but in no event later than
thirty (30) days following the applicable Closing Date, return to Sellers all
tangible materials that embody or record the Seller Parent Technical Information
in accordance with the return procedures set forth in the Technical Information
Confidentiality Agreement and destroy any electronic records of the Seller
Parent Technical Information. In furtherance of the foregoing, as promptly as
practicable after the applicable Closing Date Purchaser shall give notice to all
employees of the Initial Acquired Companies and, if any, the Subsequent Acquired
Companies, of the need to cease all further use and disclosure of the Seller
Parent Technical Information and of the new arrangements that Purchaser has
established or is establishing to provide the employees with equivalent
information from Purchaser. Such notice to employees shall at least entail
meetings with employees of an Initial Acquired Company or a Subsequent Acquired
Company, if any, upon the announcement of the applicable Closing and at the
completion of the steps to achieve that Acquired Company's compliance with this
SECTION 6.18, which meetings shall inform the employees of their confidentiality
commitments and train them on the replacement information from Purchaser.
Employees shall also be sent written communications explaining that the Seller
Parent Technical Information may no longer be used and may not be disclosed to
any third parties. Purchaser shall provide to Sellers a certificate of a

<PAGE>

senior officer of Purchaser within thirty (30) days following the applicable
Closing Date confirming that Purchaser and each of the applicable Acquired
Companies have complied with their obligations under this SECTION 6.18.

6.19     PROCUREMENT. Purchaser agrees that it shall cause each of the Initial
Acquired Companies and, if any, the Subsequent Acquired Companies immediately
following the applicable Closing Date to cease to purchase any further goods or
services under purchasing arrangements or contracts made available to such
Acquired Companies by Sellers or any of their Affiliates or Cingular Wireless
LLC or its Affiliates and promptly to make or satisfy all payments,
reimbursements and other obligations and amounts owed to Sellers and their
Affiliates in relation to such purchasing arrangements or contracts; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, Purchaser shall not be responsible for any payment or other penalty
that would be payable as a result of the early termination of such purchasing
arrangements or contracts other than with respect to any such payment or other
penalties that may be assessed by any third party in connection with such early
termination. Purchaser and the Acquired Companies shall be solely responsible
for obtaining at their expense any required transfers of or replacements for
license, lease, support and maintenance agreements relating to computer hardware
or software from third party vendors, which prior to the applicable Closing were
used, made available to or acquired via the Seller Parent, Sellers or
multi-company purchasing arrangements involving countries outside the Territory
or companies other than the Acquired Companies. Seller Parent shall use
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser and the Acquired Companies in
this regard, for up to one hundred and eighty (180) days following the
applicable Closing Date.

6.20     REMOVAL OF BUSINESS CUSTOMER RECORDS. As soon as practicable after each
Closing but in any event no later than sixty (60) days after such Closing,
Seller Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remove from its
records all Business Customer Records that relate to customers located in the
country to which such Closing relates.

6.21     TERMINATION OF THE INTERCOMPANY AGREEMENTS. Seller Parent shall ensure
that on each Closing Date a Services Termination Letter and Trademark License
Termination Letter is executed by all necessary parties to immediately terminate
all Technical Services Agreements and Seller Parent Mark License Agreements that
apply to the country that is the subject of the applicable Closing. Any
Technical Services Subcontract related to the Technical Services Agreements
being terminated shall be assigned to Purchaser or its designee as of the date
of the applicable Services Termination Letter, but only to the extent to which
Seller Parent has the right to so assign. In either event, Sellers and Purchaser
will direct, instruct and cause each Acquired Company that terminates or assigns
the Technical Services Agreements and Seller Parent Mark License Agreements to
pay or satisfy all payments, reimbursements and other obligations and amounts
owed to Sellers and its Affiliates in relation to such Agreements.

6.22     MOVICS SOFTWARE LICENSES. To the extent that BellSouth International,
Inc. or any other Affiliate of Seller Parent has granted any sublicenses of the
MOVICS software to an Acquired Company, then as of the applicable Closing Date
with respect to such Acquired Company (a) if CRM is the subject of such Closing
or any previous Closing, CRM shall assume all such sublicenses with such
Acquired Company, which thereafter shall be direct agreements between CRM and
such Acquired Company, and (b) if CRM is not the subject of such Closing or

<PAGE>

any previous Closing, BellSouth International, Inc. or the applicable Affiliate
of Seller Parent shall continue to grant the MOVICS sublicense to such Acquired
Company.

6.23     TRANSITION TRADEMARK LICENSE AGREEMENT. Purchaser and Seller Parent
will enter into the Transition Trademark License Agreement in order to permit
the Acquired Companies that are the subject of any Closing to wind down their
usage of the Seller Parent Marks in conformance with Purchaser's covenants in
SECTION 6.17 above. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall also ensure that on the
applicable Closing Date a BIPHO Transition License Agreement (or equivalent
alternative agreement) is executed to grant sufficient rights to permit the
applicable Acquired Companies to wind-down their usage of the "BELL" mark in
conformance with Purchaser's covenants in SECTION 6.17 above. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in the Transition Trademark
License Agreement, no Initial Acquired Company or any Subsequent Acquired
Company shall be permitted to use (and Purchaser shall not permit any such
Acquired Company to use), following the applicable Closing relating to such
Acquired Company, the Seller Parent Marks in connection with any regulatory,
lobbying or public policy matter.

6.24     ASSIGNMENT OF CERTAIN TRADEMARK RIGHTS. Within twenty (20) days of the
date hereof, Seller Parent shall identify the Latin America Marks, which shall
include all of the registrations and applications set forth in SCHEDULE 6.24. As
of each Closing Date, Seller Parent shall assign and transfer to Purchaser or
its designee all of Seller Parent's right, title and interest in all Latin
America Marks that are used exclusively by any or all of the Acquired Companies
that are the subject of such Closing or any earlier Closing. Seller Parent, the
applicable Acquired Companies and Purchaser shall then cooperate to achieve as
soon as practicable after the applicable Closing: (a) the recordation of the
assignment of the Latin America Marks and the registrations and applications
pertaining thereto with all applicable Governmental Authorities or any other
required filing with applicable Governmental Authorities, and (b) to the extent
necessary, sign such other documentation or papers as is necessary to confirm
the ownership rights of Purchaser or its designee to the Latin America Marks.

6.25     ASSIGNMENT BACK OF SELLER PARENT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. The
parties recognize that certain Seller Parent Intellectual Property Rights may be
the subject of applications to register or may be registered in the name of an
Acquired Company, for example through administrative error or in breach of one
or more of the agreements with Seller Parent, BellSouth Intellectual Property
Corporation, BellSouth IP Management Corporation or Bell IP Holding LLC. Within
twenty (20) days of the date hereof, Seller Parent shall identify such
Intellectual Property Rights applications or registrations and provide a list of
the same to Purchaser. Seller Parent, the applicable Acquired Companies and
Purchaser shall then cooperate to achieve as soon as practicable either prior to
or after each applicable Closing: (a) a transfer of such registrations and
applications to Seller Parent, together with all files and records pertaining to
such registrations and applications, (b) the recordation of all such transfers
with applicable Governmental Authorities or any other required filing with
applicable Governmental Authorities, and (c) to the extent necessary, sign such
other documentation or papers as is necessary to confirm the ownership rights of
Seller Parent to such Intellectual Property Rights.

not permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, own,
operate or manage, in any country in which an Initial Acquired Company or a
Subsequent Acquired Company primarily operates as of the applicable Closing

any manner whatsoever and (ii) to any Non-Transferred Company.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of SECTION 6.26(a), nothing in this Agreement

         applicable Subsequent Closing Date, respectively;

         (ii) the selling of telecommunications equipment under or in connection

         of any class of voting equity securities or other equity interests of
         any Person engaged in the Wireless Service Business whose securities or
         equity interests are publicly traded, PROVIDED that none of Seller
         Parent, Sellers or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates has
         representation on the board of directors of such Person or otherwise
         has the right to participate in management of such entity;

         (iv) the provision by Seller Parent, Sellers or any of their respective
         Subsidiaries or Affiliates of international long distance services or
         data network communications services in any jurisdiction in which the
         Wireless Service Business is conducted;

         (v) Seller Parent, Sellers or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
         Affiliates thereof from (A) continuing to own, operate and engage in

         Company and engaging in any activities

<PAGE>

         consistent in scope with the activities of operating such Retained

         obligations as set forth under certain of the Related Agreements;

         (vi) purchases of securities or other equity interests for investment
         purposes by Seller Parent, Sellers or any of their respective

         employees of Seller Parent, Sellers or any of their respective
         Subsidiaries or Affiliates;

         (vii) the acquisition by Seller Parent, Sellers or any of their
         respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates of any or their investment in
         Person (whether through the purchase of stock or assets or by way of
         merger, consolidation, business combination or other transaction)
         engaged in the Wireless Service Business so long as no more than
         twenty-five percent (25%) of the revenues of the combined business is
         engaged in the Wireless Service Business; or

         (viii) the acquisition of Seller Parent or one or more Sellers by any
         non-Affiliate thereof that is engaged in the Wireless Service Business;
         PROVIDED that, the acquisition of Seller Parent or one or more Sellers
         shall not terminate the obligations of Seller Parent, Sellers and their
         respective Subsidiaries set forth in SECTION 6.26(a), except that such
         obligation shall be limited to the Subsidiaries of Seller Parent or any
         Seller who are Subsidiaries of Seller Parent or any Seller immediately
         prior to such acquisition.

6.27     THIRD PARTY MARKETING AND SUPPLY AGREEMENTS. Prior to the applicable
Closing Date, each Seller shall cause each Acquired Company that is the subject
of any Closing to terminate all marketing, supply and other similar agreements
between such Acquired Company and any third parties that are dependent on rights
to use Seller Parent Marks.

6.28     CONTACTS WITH EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND CERTAIN PERSONS.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the applicable Closing Date, without
the prior written consent of Sellers, Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Representatives or any other Person on its behalf to, directly or
indirectly, contact, solicit, communicate with (whether orally, in writing or in
any other manner) or otherwise engage in any discussions or communications with,
or attempt to contact, solicit, communicate or otherwise engage in any
discussions or communications with, any employees, customers, creditors,
lenders, noteholders, agents or participants in the distribution channel
(including distributors and resellers) of, any Acquired Company in connection
with or pertaining to any subject matter of this Agreement, including future
employment, consulting, creditor, lender, agency or distribution relationships
or the terms thereof, post-closing staffing issues, post-closing benefits
matters, compensation and bonus matters, severance issues or any other matters;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Purchaser shall be entitled to conduct due diligence in
conformity with this Agreement and conduct its business consistent with past
practices.

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the applicable Closing or, in the
event of a termination of this Agreement for any reason, for the two-year period
commencing on the date of

<PAGE>

such termination, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall, either
directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, or attempt to solicit for
employment, or otherwise hire (other than pursuant to a general advertisement or
other similar general solicitation within the Territory or the United States),
without the prior written consent of Seller Representative, any Person who is
(i) an officer, director, senior manager or salesperson of any Acquired Company
or any BellSouth Entity or (ii) any other employee, consultant, agent or
participant in the distribution channel (including any distributor or reseller)
of any Acquired Company or any BellSouth Entity with whom Purchaser or any of
its representatives met, were introduced to or otherwise became familiar with in
connection with Purchaser's due diligence investigation of the Acquired
Companies or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In the event of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of
this SECTION 6.28(b) by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, Sellers shall be
entitled to an injunction restraining such Person from any such breach. Nothing
herein shall be construed as prohibiting Sellers from pursuing any other
available remedy for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of
damages.

(c) In the event that there is a Closing under this Agreement and (i) the
Argentinian Acquired Company or the Chilean Acquired Company becomes a Retained
Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and/or (ii) any Acquired Company
becomes a Section 6.29 Retained Company, for the two-year period commencing on
date of the determination that any such Acquired Company has become a Retained
Company or a Section 6.29 Retained Company, neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates shall, either directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, or
attempt to solicit for employment, or otherwise hire (other than pursuant to a
general advertisement or other similar general solicitation within the countries
where such Retained Company or Section 6.29 Retained Company operates or
conducts its business), without the prior written consent of Seller
Representative, any Person who is (i) an officer, director, senior manager or
salesperson of such Retained Company or Section 6.29 Retained Company or (ii)
any other employee, consultant, agent or participant in the distribution channel

Retained Company with whom Purchaser or any of its representatives met, were
introduced to or otherwise became familiar with in connection with Purchaser's
due diligence investigation of the Acquired Companies or otherwise in connection

or threatened breach of the provisions of this SECTION 6.28(c) by Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates, Sellers shall be entitled to an injunction restraining
such Person from any such breach. Nothing herein shall be construed as
prohibiting Sellers from pursuing any other available remedy for such breach or
threatened breach, including the recovery of damages.

6.29     ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURE.

(a) The parties agree that in the event issues arise that could reasonably be
expected to prevent the parties from obtaining the Required Minority Equity
Holder Approvals or the Required Regulatory Approvals with respect to any
Acquired Company prior to the Non-Transferred Company Determination Date with
respect to such Acquired Company (an "ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURE EVENT"), Purchaser
and Sellers, subject, in the case of Sellers, to the Minority Equity Holder
Rights, and in all cases, to the avoidance of Initial Closing Legal Prohibitions
or Subsequent Closing Legal Prohibitions, as applicable, shall continue to use
best efforts, and proceed expeditiously and in good faith, to consummate the
purchase, sale and other

<PAGE>

transactions contemplated hereunder with respect to each Acquired Company.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of an Alternative
Structure Event, the parties shall use best efforts, and proceed expeditiously
and in good faith, to restructure the form of the transactions contemplated
hereby in order to proceed with the substance of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement pursuant to such alternative structures and transactions which
would have a materially improved chance of completion and which may be
accomplished in a manner that preserves the allocation of benefits,
opportunities, costs, responsibilities, liabilities and net economic benefit of
the transactions contemplated hereby to Purchaser and Sellers (taking into
account the effect of Taxes) and for consideration equal to the consideration
allocated to the transactions pursuant to SECTION 2.2 of the Agreement.

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, an Acquired Company shall be deemed to be a
"SECTION 6.29 RETAINED COMPANY" upon the earliest to occur of (the "SECTION 6.29
RETAINED COMPANY DETERMINATION DATE") (i) the date upon which Sellers provide
written notice to Purchaser that Sellers have determined in good faith that,
despite the parties' compliance with all of the covenants and obligations
contained in this Agreement to be performed and complied with by it prior to the
Initial Closing or any Subsequent Closing, as applicable, related to such
Acquired Company, (A) one or both of the conditions to closing set forth in
SECTION 7.1(b) and (c) (in the case of the Initial Closing) or SECTION
7.4(a)(ii) and (iii) (in the case of a Subsequent Closing) with respect to such
Acquired Company are not reasonably likely to be satisfied as of the
Non-Transferred Company Determination Date and (B) the parties are unable to
agree upon alternative structures and transactions as contemplated in the last
sentence of SECTION 6.29(a), (ii) the date upon which Sellers and Purchaser
mutually agree that, despite each party's compliance with all of the covenants
and obligations contained in this Agreement to be performed and complied with by
it prior to the Initial Closing or any Subsequent Closing, as applicable,
related to such Acquired Company, (A) one or both of the conditions to closing
set forth in SECTION 7.1(b) and (c) (in the case of the Initial Closing) or
SECTION 7.4(a)(ii) and (iii) (in the case of a Subsequent Closing) with respect
to such Acquired Company are not reasonably likely to be satisfied as of the
Non-Transferred Company Determination Date and (B) the parties are unable to
agree upon alternative structures and transactions as contemplated in the last
sentence of SECTION 6.29(a) and (iii) the Non-Transferred Company Determination
Date, if the Initial Closing or Subsequent Closing, as the case may be, does not
occur with respect to such Acquired Company because, despite each party's
compliance with all of the covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement
to be performed and complied with by it prior to the Initial Closing or any
Subsequent Closing, as applicable, related to such Acquired Company, as of such
date, (A) one or both of the conditions to Closing set forth in SECTIONS 7.1(b)
and (c), with respect to an Initial Closing, or SECTION 7.4(a)(ii) and (iii),
with respect to any Subsequent Closing, were not satisfied and (B) the parties
were unable to agree upon alternative structures and transactions as
contemplated in the last sentence of SECTION 6.29(a).

(c) In the event that any Acquired Company becomes a Section 6.29 Retained
Company, (i) the parties shall nevertheless be obligated to consummate the
Initial Closing and any Subsequent Closing and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement except with respect to any such Section 6.29
Retained Company (or any Retained Company or ROFR Company), (ii) the applicable
Seller will retain and continue to hold and own its Seller Equity Interests or
Holding Company Equity Interests relating to, and any Sellers Stockholder Debt
with regard to, any such Section 6.29 Retained Company, (iii) the Sellers Equity
Interests of any such

<PAGE>

Section 6.29 Retained Company shall be deemed to be excluded from the definition
of "Sellers Equity Interests" and "Holding Company Equity Interests" for all
purposes of this Agreement and (iv) no representations or warranties shall be
deemed to have been made by Sellers with respect to any such Section 6.29
Retained Company. For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Section 6.29
Determination Date with respect to any Section 6.29 Acquired Company,
SECTIONS 6.5 and 6.6 and ARTICLE III, as well as any other provisions that would
otherwise reasonably be interpreted to treat such Section 6.29 Retained Company
as an Acquired Company whose Sellers Equity Interests are being transferred
directly or indirectly pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will no longer be applicable to such Section 6.29 Retained Company,
PROVIDED, that SECTIONS 6.8 and 6.28 as well as the Confidentiality Agreement,
will continue to be applicable to all Section 6.29 Retained Companies.

6.30     COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Purchaser agrees that, in seeking to comply with
this Agreement, including obtaining the Required Regulatory Approvals and
Required Minority Equity Holder Approvals, Purchaser and its Representatives
shall comply with all applicable Laws and shall not in any manner, directly or
indirectly, induce, solicit, encourage (or permit the encouragement of),
instruct or in any manner direct any director, officer, employee, consultant or
advisor of the Acquired Companies to take or omit to take any actions that could
violate applicable Law or the policies of any Acquired Company.

6.31     INTERMEDIATE HOLDING COMPANIES. Prior to the applicable Closing Date
with respect to a particular Operating Company, one or more of the Sellers
intend to use their best efforts to eliminate as many Intermediate Holding
Companies organized in the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands and Panama.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) Sellers shall only be obligated to eliminate
Peck Holdings if a Dutch Residency Certificate for Peck Holdings can be obtained
prior to such applicable Closing Date and (b) Sellers shall not be obligated to
eliminate the Intermediate Holding Companies listed in SCHEDULE 6.31. In
determining whether they have used their best efforts, Sellers will take into
account any proposals set forth by Purchaser.

6.32     CHILEAN COMPANY TRANSFERS. Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers may, in
their sole discretion, enter into a transaction or series of transactions to
effect the contribution of BellSouth Comunicaciones, S.A., a Chilean sociedad
anonima, and/or BellSouth Inversiones, S.A., a Chilean sociedad anonima, to a
Netherlands BV; PROVIDED, that Sellers shall not enter into such transactions
unless (a) on the applicable Closing Date there are no Acquired Companies in the
ownership chain that are not organized in The Netherlands or Chile and
(b) Sellers first obtain an opinion of Chilean tax counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser that concludes that (i) Sellers will have a reasonable
basis for reporting that such transactions do not result in the recognition of
gain for Chilean tax purposes and (ii) any such Netherlands BV (or such other
Holding Company or Intermediate Holding Company then holding such shares) should
have a basis in the shares of BellSouth Comunicaciones, S.A. and BellSouth
Inversiones, S.A. for Chilean tax purposes at least equal to the Allocated
Purchase Price for such Acquired Companies.

6.33     POST-CLOSING ACTIVITIES.

(a) Prior to January 1 of the year following the applicable Closing Date with
respect to a particular Operating Company and related Intermediate Holding
Companies, Purchaser and

<PAGE>

its Affiliates (including, for purposes of this SECTION 6.33(a), the Acquired
Companies) shall not engage in any transaction with or involving any Acquired
Company or take any action outside the ordinary course of business with or
involving any Acquired Company unless (i) Sellers have received from Purchaser
an opinion of counsel mutually agreed to by the parties that such transaction
would not result in an increase in the earnings and profits (as defined in Code
Section 964) of any of the Acquired Companies (or their successors),
(ii) Sellers otherwise consent in writing or (iii) Purchaser takes all steps
that are necessary to completely eliminate all current or accumulated earnings
and profits (as defined in Code Section 964) of the Acquired Company that takes
such action or engages in such transaction.

(b) Prior to January 1 of the year following the applicable Closing Date with
respect to a particular Operating Company and related Intermediate Holding
Companies, Purchaser and its Affiliates (including, for purposes of this SECTION
6.33(b), the Acquired Companies) shall not engage in any transaction outside the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices while owned by
Sellers which would result in any of the Acquired Companies (or a successor to
such company) recognizing income that would be treated as Subpart F Income or
engage in any transaction (even if in the ordinary course of business) that
would result in an Acquired Company that is not an Operating Company recognizing
any income that would be Subpart F Income (other than the investment of existing
cash reserves and cash from operations); PROVIDED, that Purchaser shall not be
deemed in breach of this requirement if prior to entering a transaction it
obtained (i) an opinion of counsel mutually agreed to by the parties that such
transaction will not result in the recognition of Subpart F Income, (ii) the
prior written consent of Sellers or (iii) Purchaser takes such steps as are
necessary to completely eliminate any Subpart F Income to the Seller with
respect to transactions occurring after the Closing Date.

(c) Purchaser has no present plan or intention to (i) liquidate, dissolve or
merge any Netherlands BV it directly or indirectly acquires from Sellers, (ii)
transfer ownership of any of the Acquired Companies; or (iii) cause any
Netherlands BV to distribute or otherwise disavow itself of ownership of any of
the Operating Companies directly or indirectly owned by it on the Closing Date.
Purchaser further agrees that it will not take any of the actions set forth in
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of the previous sentence prior to January 1 of the
second year following the applicable Closing Date with respect to a particular
Operating Company unless (i) such action was not reasonably foreseeable at the
Closing Date with respect to a particular Operating Company or (ii) there is a
significant intervening event that was not foreseen on such Closing Date.

(d) Purchaser presently intends to and will, unless some event occurs that is
not reasonably foreseeable as of the Closing Date, cause each Netherlands BV and
each Operating Company to continue to hold directly, or to the extent held
indirectly as of the Closing Date, indirectly, a significant portion of the
assets held by it on the applicable Closing Date (without taking into account
distributions made pursuant to SECTION 6.35).

(e) Purchaser will not make an election under Code Section 338 with respect to
any of the Acquired Companies.

(f) Purchasers shall file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns due after the
Closing Date for the Acquired Companies and shall pay all Taxes shown as due and
owing on such Tax

<PAGE>

Returns except to the extent that such Taxes would be indemnified by Sellers
pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(v) or (vi). Any Tax Return required to be prepared
by Purchasers or one of the Acquired Companies but for which Sellers may be
responsible for the payment of any Taxes thereon shall be provided to Sellers at
least thirty (30) days prior to filing and shall be subject to the reasonable
comments of Sellers.

(g) Any Tax Return prepared by Purchaser which includes or is based on the
operations, ownership, assets or activities of any Acquired Company for any
period for which Seller is required to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to this
agreement shall be prepared in accordance with past Tax accounting and other
practices used by the Acquired Companies, Sellers or Seller Parent with respect
to the Tax Returns in question (unless such past practices are no longer
permissible under applicable Tax law), and to the extent any items are not
covered by past practices (or in the event such past practices are no longer
permissible under applicable Tax law), in accordance with reasonable practices
selected by Purchaser with the consent of Seller, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

6.34     DISTRIBUTION OF TELECOM BBS (B.V.I.) LTD. Sellers shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the distribution of Telecom BBS (B.V.I.), Ltd. to
BellSouth International Latin America, Inc. prior to the applicable Closing
Date or, if such distribution  is not made  prior to such Closing Date with
respect to the Acquired Companies relating to Venezuela, shall indemnify the
Purchaser for all liabilities of Telecom BBS (B.V.I.), Ltd.

6.35     POST-SALE DISTRIBUTIONS. Purchaser shall distribute, or cause to be
distributed, all cash which is held directly by each Netherlands BV that
directly or indirectly owns Telcel S.A. or BellSouth Panama S.A. at the
applicable Closing Date prior to the next January 1 after the applicable Closing
Date. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to distribute or cause
to be distributed a note or other asset in an amount equal to all of the current
and accumulated earnings and profits (as defined in Code Section 964) of such
Netherlands BVs that exist following such cash distribution prior to January 1
of the year after the Closing Date with respect to each such Netherlands BV. If
Purchaser believes that, notwithstanding its commercially reasonable efforts, it
cannot make the required distributions of current and accumulated earnings and
profits, it shall promptly notify Sellers in writing. In determining whether it
has used commercially reasonable efforts, Purchaser will (a) disregard the
effect of any withholding taxes or amounts paid from The Netherlands to Spain,
(b) disregard any Spanish tax on interest income on the notes or Spanish tax on
the actual or deemed distribution from The Netherlands to Spain and (c) take
into account any proposals set forth by Sellers. Purchaser agrees that, absent a
significant change in circumstances that was not foreseen on the date of
Closing, it will not recontribute any amount distributed pursuant to this
section for three (3) years following the distribution.

6.36     PERU. (a) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions
of this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take all steps
necessary to obtain as soon as practicable the Required Regulatory Approvals and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including taking,
accepting or otherwise engaging in any and all Actions of Divestiture requested
by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Peruvian Acquired Company.

<PAGE>

(b) The parties agree that if, despite their compliance with all of their
respective covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement, including
Purchaser's obligations set forth in SECTION 6.36(a), prior to or as of (i) the
date of the Initial Closing or any Subsequent Closing in which the Sellers
Equity Interests in Peck Holdings or any successor Holding Company that includes
the Peruvian Acquired Company will be sold to Purchaser or (ii) the
Non-Transferred Company Determination Date with respect to the Peruvian Acquired
Company, it is deemed by the parties acting in good faith that it is not
reasonably likely to satisfy the conditions to closing set forth (A) in the case
of the Initial Closing, in SECTIONS 7.1(a) or (b), or (B) in the case of a
Subsequent Closing, in SECTIONS 7.4(a)(i) or (ii), Purchaser and Sellers agree
that Sellers shall retain the Peruvian Acquired Company and promptly thereafter
Sellers shall arrange for the orderly sale or other disposition of all or any
portion of the capital stock or assets of the Peruvian Acquired Company to one
or more Persons who are unaffiliated with Sellers. Any such sale or disposition
made by Sellers is referred to as the "ALTERNATIVE PERUVIAN TRANSACTION." Upon
the completion of any such Alternative Peruvian Transaction, Sellers will
determine the Net Proceeds received by Sellers in connection with such
Alternative Peruvian Transaction, and then determine the shortfall or profit, if
any, based upon the comparison of (i) the Sellers Allocated Payment, as adjusted
in accordance with SECTION 2.4 (and assuming for purposes of such adjustment
that a Closing with respect to the Peruvian Acquired Company had taken place on
the Non-Transferred Company Determination Date) and (ii) such Net Proceeds (such
shortfalls or profit, the "PERUVIAN DIFFERENCE"), and shall provide a written
statement setting forth such determination of the Peruvian Difference to
Purchaser (a "PERUVIAN DIFFERENCE DETERMINATION"). If the Peruvian Difference
Determination reflects a shortfall, then, with ten (10) Business Days following
Purchaser's receipt of the Peruvian Difference Determination, Purchaser will pay
to Sellers an amount equal to 100% of such shortfall. If the Peruvian Difference
Determination reflects a profit, then, within ten (10) Business Days following
Purchaser's receipt of the Peruvian Acquired Determination, Sellers will pay to
Purchaser 100% of such profit.

6.37     RETAINED COMPANIES AND SECTION 6.29 RETAINED COMPANIES. In the event
that any Acquired Company becomes a Retained Company or a Section 6.29 Retained
Company, Purchaser agrees that it shall take all actions reasonably requested by
Sellers, and shall promptly execute and deliver all certificates, notices or
other documentation as may be necessary to confirm the status of any Retained
Company or Section 6.29 Retained Company, including to confirm the ownership by
Sellers of the Sellers Equity Interests therein, free and clear of all
obligations or liabilities arising hereunder except as otherwise expressly set
forth in this Agreement.

6.38     ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS AND ARRANGEMENTS. In the event that (a) the
parties are required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement through one or more Subsequent Closings or (b) any Acquired Company
becomes a Non-Transferred Company, then the parties agree that, as of each
Closing, if (i) any Acquired Company that is the subject of such Closing (A)
owns any Intellectual Property Right, technology or software that is used by any
Non-Transferred Company or any other Acquired Company that is not being
transferred at such Closing and has not been transferred at any prior Closing,
as the case may be, or (B) provides services to, or is a party to any supply or
purchase agreement that includes the provision of supplies or other materials
to, any Non-Transferred Company or any Acquired Company that is not being
transferred at such Closing and has not been transferred at any prior Closing,
as the

<PAGE>

case may be, and/or (ii) any Non-Transferred Company or any Acquired
Company that is not being transferred at such Closing and has not been
transferred at any prior Closing, as the case may be, (A) owns any Intellectual
Property Right, technology or software that is used by any Acquired Company that
is the subject of such Closing or (B) provides services to, or is a party to any
supply or purchase agreement that includes the provision of supplies or other
materials to, any Acquired Company that is the subject of such Closing, then, in
either case, Sellers shall determine in their sole discretion whether it is
necessary for the parties to cause any Acquired Companies being transferred at
such Closing, on the one hand, and the Non-Transferred Companies and the
Acquired Companies that are not being transferred at such Closing (or at any
prior Closing), on the other hand, to enter into any Contracts or other
arrangements as of the applicable Closing Date that will allow each of the
Acquired Companies that are transferred at such Closing, the Acquired Companies
that are not transferred at such Closing (or at any prior Closing) and the
Non-Transferred Companies to operate their respective businesses following any
such Closing in a manner that is consistent with the manner in which such
businesses are operated on such Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this
SECTION 6.38 shall not include or affect any Intellectual Property Right,
technology or software that is owned by any BellSouth Entity, which matters are
the subject of other Sections in ARTICLE VI of this Agreement.

6.39     MOVICOM AND MOVISTAR MARKS. Seller Parent and Sellers agree that in the
event all of the Acquired Companies that use the MOVICOM mark are acquired by
Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then from and after the date
of the Closing with respect to the last of such Acquired Companies neither
Seller Parent nor Sellers shall challenge, contest or oppose any registrations
or applications for registration of the MOVICOM mark in the Territory by
Purchaser or any of Purchaser's Affiliates. For each country in the Territory
where the MOVICOM mark is used and an Acquired Company is located, Seller Parent
and Sellers agree and acknowledge that for such country after the Acquired
Company located in such country has been subject to a Closing (a) Seller Parent
and Sellers shall not commence, continue or support financially any proceeding
concerning or contesting the registration or any application for registration of
the MOVISTAR mark in that country, (b) as between Seller Parent, Sellers and
Purchaser, Purchaser shall have the exclusive right, title and interest in and
to the MOVISTAR mark in such country and (c) Seller Parent and Sellers shall
take all actions and execute all documents as are reasonably requested by
Purchaser in connection with any and all applications by Purchaser or
Purchaser's Affiliates for registration of the MOVISTAR mark in such country;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that it is understood and agreed that the foregoing shall not
apply to any Non-Transferred Companies and the countries in which they are
located.

6.40     DISCUSSIONS WITH LENDERS. Sellers and Purchaser agree to establish a
committee, the members of which shall be, for Sellers, those individuals set
forth in PART A of SCHEDULE 6.40, and for Purchaser, those individuals set forth
in PART B of SCHEDULE 6.40 (or their successors in office from time to time)
(the "FINANCING COMMITTEE"). Sellers agree that prior to engaging in any course
of negotiations with any creditors of any Acquired Companies following the date
hereof regarding the refinancing or material amendment of any material Debt
(other than Pay-Off Debt except to the extent to be refinanced with non-Pay-Off
Debt) of any Acquired Company, and from time to time following the initiation of
such negotiations, Sellers' members on the Financing Committee shall (so long as
it does not breach any confidentiality provisions in any applicable credit
agreement or other financing agreement to which any Acquired Company is a party)
advise and consult with Purchaser's members on the Financing Committee, each to

<PAGE>

consult in good faith, as to the general strategy and approach to be pursued by
Sellers and the applicable Acquired Companies in such negotiations, and
Purchaser agrees that it shall conduct any discussions it is permitted to have
pursuant to this SECTION 6.40 with such creditors only after prior notice to
Sellers' members on the Financing Committee, only through Purchaser's members on
the Financing Committee and only in a manner consistent with such strategy and
approach; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Sellers shall in no event be bound to pursue any particular general
strategy and approach in any discussions they may have with any creditor of any
Acquired Company, whether or not previously discussed with Purchaser; PROVIDED,
FURTHER, HOWEVER, that, as a result of, or in connection with, such discussions,
Purchaser shall not be liable to any BellSouth Entity in any way for the Debt of
any Non-Transferred Company, except to the extent that Purchaser is in violation
of any of its obligations hereunder or has acted in bad faith or with willful
misconduct. After obtaining the prior approval of the Sellers' members of the
Financing Committee, Purchaser's members of the Financing Committee may, at
their option, discuss with any creditors of the Acquired Companies the extension
of (a) any Pay-Off Debt other than Pay-Off Debt in Argentina or Colombia or
other than any Pay-Off Debt for which there is a BellSouth Guarantee or (b) any
Debt other than Pay-Off Debt. The members of the Financing Committee will, at
their respective cost and expense, seek to meet with appropriate representatives
of the creditors in Colombia and Argentina as soon as practicable after the date
hereof. In Colombia, the members will seek amendments to the restructuring
documents so that (i) Purchaser is a permitted buyer that will not trigger the
acceleration of the maturity of the restructured Debt and (ii) upon the Closing
of the Colombia Acquired Companies, Sellers and their Affiliates will be
released from all obligations with respect to the restructured Debt. In
Argentina, the members will use commercially reasonable efforts to agree as to
the position to be taken with the creditors, but in the event they are unable to
agree, then Sellers' members shall have sole right to negotiate directly with
such creditors and Purchaser's members shall have no communications whatsoever
with such creditors, except to the extent explicitly permitted by Sellers'
members. Sellers' members and Purchaser's members will consult with each other
regarding any other issues with respect to Debt as any member may reasonably
request from time to time.

                      CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE CLOSINGS

7.1      MUTUAL CONDITIONS TO THE INITIAL CLOSING. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the obligations of each party to this Agreement to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the
Initial Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the Initial
Closing Date of each of the following conditions:

(a) No Governmental Order shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or
enforced by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction that prohibits,
restrains, enjoins, or restricts the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements that are the subject
of the Initial Closing, unless such Governmental Order would not result in the
operation of the businesses of the Initial Acquired Companies following the
Initial Closing Date (assuming the Initial Closing Date occurs) in a manner that
is materially adverse or detrimental to the conduct of the businesses of the
Initial Acquired Companies as compared to the conduct of the businesses of the
Initial Acquired Companies on

<PAGE>

the date hereof (an "INITIAL CLOSING LEGAL PROHIBITION"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that (i) if Purchaser is prepared to waive the foregoing Initial Closing Legal
Prohibition, then Sellers may not thereafter refuse to close on the basis of
such Initial Closing Legal Prohibition unless closing under the circumstances of
such Initial Closing Legal Prohibition would have an adverse effect on Sellers
or the BellSouth Entities, (ii) in the event any Initial Closing Legal
Prohibition is not final and nonappealable, the parties shall continue to be
subject to the terms of SECTION 6.29 with respect to any Acquired Company that
is the subject of such Initial Closing Legal Prohibition; (iii) in the event of
the imposition of any such Initial Closing Legal Prohibition, the existence of
such Initial Closing Legal Prohibition shall be understood to result in the
failure to satisfy the condition to the Initial Closing set forth in this
SECTION 7.1(a) only with respect to the Acquired Company (or Acquired Companies)
or particular transactions to which the Initial Closing Legal Prohibition
applies; and (iv) if Purchaser shall have failed to take any Action of
Divestiture required by SECTION 6.5(b), such Initial Closing Legal Prohibition
shall be deemed to have been waived by Purchaser (unless such a waiver is
prohibited by Law) and Purchaser shall not oppose the seeking of a court order
specifically enforcing Purchaser's performance under this Agreement (including
the obligations of Purchaser to take or accept all Actions of Divestiture other
than, with respect to the Argentinian Acquired Company and the Chilean Acquired
Company and subject to Purchaser's obligations set forth in the last sentence of
SECTION 6.5(b), any Actions of Divesture having an Action of Divestiture Fair
Value that would exceed, in the aggregate, the Action of Divestiture Threshold).

(b) The parties shall have obtained all Required Regulatory Approvals with
respect to the Initial Acquired Companies that are required under applicable
antitrust laws, foreign investment laws and material Communications Licenses
that, in each case, are necessary in order to permit the Initial Acquired
Companies to operate their businesses following the Initial Closing Date in a
manner that is not materially adverse or detrimental as compared to the conduct
of their business as of the date hereof ("INITIAL CLOSING REQUIRED REGULATORY
APPROVALS"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) if Purchaser shall have failed to take
any Action of Divestiture required by SECTION 6.5(b) (subject to Purchaser's
obligations set forth in the last sentence of SECTION 6.5(b), other than any
Actions of Divestiture solely with respect to the Argentinian Acquired Company
and the Chilean Acquired Company having an Action of Divestiture Fair Value that
would exceed, in the aggregate, the Action of Divestiture Threshold) or to take
the actions required by SECTION 6.29(a), such Initial Closing Required
Regulatory Approval shall be deemed to have been waived by Purchaser (unless
such a waiver is prohibited by applicable Law); and (ii) that in the event that
(A) the Argentinian Acquired Company and/or the Chilean Acquired Company are
Retained Companies or (B) any of the Acquired Companies (including the
Argentinian Acquired Company and the Chilean Acquired Company) are Section 6.29
Retained Companies, then the condition to the Initial Closing contained in this
SECTION 7.1(b) shall nonetheless be deemed to be satisfied in respect of all
other Acquired Companies with respect to which all Initial Closing Required
Regulatory Approvals have been obtained.

(c) The parties shall have obtained all Required Minority Equity Holder
Approvals with respect to the Initial Acquired Companies the absence of which
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect ("INITIAL CLOSING
REQUIRED MINORITY EQUITY HOLDER APPROVALS"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) if
Purchaser shall have failed to comply with its obligations as set forth in
ARTICLE III, such Initial Closing Required Minority Equity Holder Approval shall
be deemed to have been waived by Purchaser (unless such a waiver is prohibited

<PAGE>

by applicable Law); and (ii) in the event that (A) the Argentinian Acquired
Company and/or the Chilean Acquired Company are Retained Companies or (B) any of
the Acquired Companies (including the Argentinian Acquired Company and the
Chilean Acquired Company) are Section 6.29 Retained Companies, then the
condition to the Initial Closing contained in this SECTION 7.1(c) shall
nonetheless be deemed to be satisfied in respect of all other Acquired Companies
with respect to which all Initial Closing Required Minority Equity Holder
Approvals have been obtained.

(d) Sellers (through Seller Representative) or Purchaser shall have sent written
notification to the other party of their desire to consummate the transactions
relating to one or more Initial Acquired Companies in accordance with SECTION
8.1(a).

(e) The Due Diligence Expiration Date shall have occurred.

7.2      CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF PURCHASER. The obligations of Purchaser to

Initial Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Purchaser at
or prior to the Initial Closing Date of each of the following conditions:

(a) The representations and warranties of each Seller and each Initial Acquired
Company contained herein and in the Additional Representations Certificate shall
have been accurate, true and correct in all material respects (except that all
such representations and warranties that are qualified by Material Adverse
Effect or Individual Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct in all
respects) on and as of the date hereof and as of the date of the Additional
Representations Certificate, respectively; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
representations and warranties of Sellers contained in SECTIONS 4.1(a), 4.2,
4.4(a), 4.4(c), 4.10, 4.12 and 4.13 and of Sellers and the applicable Acquired
Companies contained in Section 1.1 of the Additional Representations Certificate
shall also be accurate, true and correct in all material respects (except that
all such representations and warranties that are qualified by Material Adverse
Effect or Individual Material Adverse Effect shall be accurate, true and correct
in all respects) on and as of the Initial Closing Date with the same force and
effect as though made by Sellers and the applicable Acquired Companies on and as
of the Initial Closing Date; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if one or more of such
representations or warranties are not accurate, true and correct in all material
respects on and as of any such date, the condition precedent in this SECTION
7.2(a) shall nevertheless be deemed satisfied unless the inaccuracy, falsity or
incorrectness of such representations or warranties would reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the ability of
Sellers to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Each Seller shall have performed and complied in all material respects with
all of its covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement to be performed
and complied with by it on or prior to the Initial Closing Date.

(c) Each Seller shall have delivered to Purchaser a certificate dated as of the

development that has had or that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(e) For the period from December 1, 2003 through the end of the most recently
completed full fiscal quarter the last day of which is at least thirty (30) days
prior to the Initial Closing Date (the "INITIAL REVENUE DETERMINATION PERIOD"),
the Revenue of the Initial Acquired Companies subject to the Initial Closing
(the "ACTUAL INITIAL REVENUE AMOUNT") shall equal or exceed the Initial Revenue
Threshold Amount. The "INITIAL REVENUE AMOUNT" shall equal the product of (i)
the Revenues of such Initial Acquired Companies for the year ended November 30,
2003 MULTIPLIED BY (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number
of full fiscal quarters elapsed during the Initial Revenue Determination Period
and the denominator of which is four (4); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for purposes
of this calculation, the impact of any Action of Divestiture taken pursuant to
this Agreement on the Revenue of such Initial Acquired Companies shall be
disregarded.

(f) With respect to each Operating Company that is capable of being closed at
the Initial Closing Date (other than the Argentinian Operating Company, any
Acquired Company that is organized or formed under the laws of a country that
requires more than one holder of its equity interests (as long as such equity
interests do not exceed 0.25% of the equity interests in such Acquired Company)
and, at Sellers' discretion, BellSouth Chile, S.A.), one or more of Sellers have
restructured, or caused the restructuring of, the ownership of such Operating
Company in such a way as to permit the acquisition by Purchaser at the Initial
Closing either of (i) the Operating Company directly or (ii) a Netherlands BV
with a Dutch Residency Certificate, which Netherlands BV shall, directly or
indirectly, own such Operating Company (singularly or together with other
Operating Companies).

(g) With respect to the Closing of the Venezuelan Acquired Company only, (i)
Sellers shall either own one hundred percent (100%) of the Equity Interests in
the Venezuelan Acquired Companies or (ii) Purchaser in its sole discretion shall
agree to waive the requirement set forth in the immediately preceding CLAUSE
(i).

7.3      CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF SELLERS. The obligations of Sellers to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect to the
Initial Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver by the Seller
Representative at or prior to the Initial Closing Date of each of the following
conditions:

Purchaser Representations Certificate shall have been accurate, true and correct
in all material respects (except that all such representations and warranties
that are qualified by Purchaser Material Adverse Effect shall be accurate, true
and correct in all respects) on and as of the date hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in SECTIONS 5.1,
5.2, 5.7 and 5.9 (except with regard to breaches or claims previously asserted
by Purchaser, including as to Loss Contingencies and indemnification claims)
shall also be accurate, true and correct in all material respects (except that
all such representations and warranties that are qualified by Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect shall be accurate, true and correct in all

<PAGE>

respects) on and as of the Initial Closing Date with the same force and effect
as though made by Purchaser on and as of the Initial Closing Date.

(b) Purchaser shall have performed and complied in all material respects with
all of its covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement to be performed
and complied with by it on or prior to the Initial Closing Date.

(c) Purchaser shall have delivered to the Seller Representative a certificate of

Guarantees relating to the Initial Acquired Companies unless Sellers, in their
sole discretion, shall have consented to the failure to obtain the release or
termination of the BellSouth Guarantees relating to the Initial Acquired
Companies, in which case Purchaser shall indemnify Sellers pursuant to SECTION
10.3(c) from and against any liabilities or obligations of Sellers or their
Affiliates arising out of or related to any payments made by a BellSouth Entity
pursuant to a BellSouth Guarantee following the Closing.

(e) Purchaser shall have paid all amounts required in connection with the
termination of the Technical Services Agreements with respect to the Initial
Acquired Companies in conformity with SECTION 6.21.

and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller Representative to the effect
that the amounts owed or payable with respect to all Pay-Off Debt of any Initial
Acquired Company required to be satisfied, paid, discharged or acquired pursuant
to SECTION 6.7(a) have been satisfied, paid, discharged or acquired in full and
such creditor(s) shall have no further claims or rights in connection therewith.

(g) Solely with respect to the Closing of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement in respect of Peck Holdings or any successor Holding Company formed to
hold (i) the Peruvian Acquired Company, (ii) the Uruguayan Acquired Company,
(iii) the Colombian Acquired Company, (iv) the Nicaraguan Acquired Company, (v)
the Venezuelan Acquired Company, and (vi) if Seller so elects, in its sole
discretion, any other Acquired Company, all conditions to Closing set forth in

of the foregoing Acquired Companies.

(h) Since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred any event or
development that has had or that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this condition shall be deemed to be
satisfied and waived in the event that Purchaser waives and releases its rights
as to any indemnity or other claim against Sellers or the BellSouth Entities
with respect to such Material Adverse Effect.

7.4      CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS OF SELLERS AND PURCHASER AS TO
SUBSEQUENT CLOSINGS. (a) The respective obligations of each party to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at any Subsequent Closing as to
Subsequent Acquired Companies shall be

<PAGE>

subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the applicable Subsequent Closing
Date of each of the following conditions:

         (i) No Governmental Order shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated
         or enforced by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
         that prohibits, restrains, enjoins, or restricts the consummation of
         the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related
         Agreements that are the subject of the Subsequent Closing, unless such
         Governmental Order would not result in the operation of the businesses
         of the Subsequent Acquired Companies that are the subject of such
         Subsequent Closing following such Subsequent Closing Date (assuming the
         Subsequent Closing were to occur) in a manner that is materially
         adverse or detrimental to the conduct of the businesses of such
         Subsequent Acquired Companies as compared to the conduct of the
         businesses of such Subsequent Acquired Companies on the date hereof (a
         "SUBSEQUENT CLOSING LEGAL PROHIBITION"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (A) if
         Purchaser is prepared to waive the Subsequent Closing Legal
         Prohibition, then Sellers may not thereafter refuse to close on the
         basis of such Subsequent Closing Legal Prohibition unless closing under
         the circumstances of such Subsequent Closing Legal Prohibition would
         have an adverse effect on Sellers or the BellSouth Entities; (B) in the
         event any Subsequent Closing Legal Prohibition is not final and
         nonappealable, the parties shall continue to be subject to the terms of
         SECTION 6.29 with respect to any Acquired Company that is the subject
         of such Subsequent Closing Legal Prohibition until the Non-Transferred
         Company Determination Date; (C) in the event of the imposition of any
         such Subsequent Closing Legal Prohibition, the existence of such
         Subsequent Closing Legal Prohibition shall be understood to result in
         the failure to satisfy the condition to Closing set forth in this
         SECTION 7.4(a)(i) only with respect to the Acquired Company (or
         Acquired Companies) to which the Subsequent Closing Legal Prohibition
         applies; and (D) that if Purchaser shall have failed to take any
         Actions of Divestiture required by SECTION 6.5(b), other than any
         Action of Divestiture solely with respect to the Argentinian Acquired
         Company and the Chilean Acquired Company that would exceed, in the
         aggregate, the Action of Divestiture Threshold, such Subsequent Closing
         Legal Prohibition shall be deemed to have been waived by Purchaser
         (unless such a waiver is prohibited by applicable Law) and Purchaser
         shall not oppose the seeking of a court order specifically enforcing
         Purchaser's performance under this Agreement (including the obligations
         of Purchaser to take or accept all Actions of Divestiture other than,
         with respect to the Argentinian Acquired Company and the Chilean
         Acquired Company and subject to Purchaser's obligations set forth in
         the last sentence of SECTION 6.5(b), any Actions of Divestiture having

         with respect to the applicable Subsequent Acquired Companies that are
         required under applicable antitrust laws, foreign investment laws and
         material Communications Licenses that, in each case, are necessary in
         order to permit the Subsequent Acquired Companies that are the subject
         of such Subsequent Closing to operate their businesses following the
         applicable Subsequent Closing Date in a manner that is not materially
         adverse or detrimental as compared to the conduct of their business as
         of the date hereof (with respect to any Subsequent Closing, the
         "SUBSEQUENT CLOSING REQUIRED REGULATORY

         to Purchaser's obligations set forth in the last sentence of
         SECTION 6.5(b), other than any Actions of Divestiture solely with

         Company having an Action of Divestiture Fair Value that would exceed,
         in the aggregate, the Action of Divestiture Threshold) or to take the
         actions required by SECTION 6.29(a), such Closing Required Regulatory
         Approval shall be deemed to have been waived by Purchaser (unless such
         a waiver is prohibited by applicable Law); and (B) that in the event

         nonetheless be deemed to be satisfied in respect of all other Acquired
         Companies with respect to which all Closing Required Regulatory
         Approvals have been obtained.

         (iii) The parties shall have obtained all Required Minority Equity

         Companies the absence of which would reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect (with respect to any Subsequent Closing, the
         "SUBSEQUENT CLOSING REQUIRED MINORITY EQUITY HOLDER APPROVALS");
         PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if Purchaser shall have failed to comply with
         its obligations as set forth in ARTICLE III, such Subsequent Closing
         Required Minority Equity Approval shall be deemed to have been waived
         by Purchaser (unless such a waiver is prohibited by applicable Law);

         Company or the Chilean Acquired Company are Retained Companies or
         (ii) any of the Acquired Companies (including the Argentinian Acquired
         Company and the Chilean Acquired Company) are Section 6.29 Retained

         Subsequent Closing Required Minority Equity Holder Approvals have been

         such Subsequent Closing (each, a "ACTUAL SUBSEQUENT REVENUE AMOUNT")
         equal or exceed the Subsequent Revenue Threshold Amount; PROVIDED,
         HOWEVER, that if the Actual Subsequent Revenue Amount with respect to
         any such Subsequent Closing does not equal or exceed the Subsequent
         Revenue Threshold Amount, then this condition will nonetheless be
         deemed satisfied if (A) the sum of (1) the Actual Subsequent Revenue
         Amount for the Subsequent Acquired Companies at such Subsequent
         Closing, PLUS (2) the Excess Initial Revenue Amount, if any, PLUS
         (3) Excess Subsequent Revenue Amounts, if any, for each earlier
         Subsequent Closing would equal or exceed (B) the Subsequent Revenue
         Threshold Amount. The "SUBSEQUENT REVENUE AMOUNT" with respect to any
         Subsequent Closing shall equal the product of (1) the Revenues of the
         Subsequent Acquired Companies that are the subject of such Subsequent
         Closing for the year ended November 30, 2003 multiplied by (2) a
         fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of full fiscal
         quarters elapsed during the applicable Subsequent Revenue Determination
         Period and the denominator of which is four (4); PROVIDED, FURTHER,
         that for purposes of this calculation, the impact of any Action of
         Divestiture taken pursuant to this Agreement on the Revenue of any
         Initial Acquired Company or any Subsequent Acquired Company shall be
         disregarded; and

         (ii) With respect to the Closing of the Venezuelan Acquired Company
         only, Sellers shall either (i) own one hundred percent (100%) of the
         Equity Interests in the Venezuelan Acquired Companies or (ii) Purchaser
         shall be satisfied in its sole discretion with respect to the rights of
         the Minority Equity Holder in the Venezuelan Acquired Company.

         (iii) The representations and warranties of each Seller and each
         Subsequent Acquired Company that is the subject of such Subsequent
         Closing contained herein and in the Additional Representations
         Certificate shall have been accurate, true and correct in all material
         respects (except that all such representations and warranties that are

         Effect shall be accurate, true and correct in all respects) on and as
         of the date hereof and as of the date of the Additional Representations
         Certificate, respectively; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the representations

         and correct in all material respects on and as of any such date, the
         condition precedent in this SECTION 7.4(b)(iii) shall nevertheless be
         deemed satisfied unless the inaccuracy, falsity or incorrectness of
         such representations or warranties would reasonably be expected to have
         a Material Adverse Effect (for purposes of this SECTION 7.4(b)(iii),
         determined only with respect to the Subsequent Acquired Companies that
         are the subject of such Subsequent Closing) or a

         material respects (except that all such representations and warranties
         that are qualified by Purchaser Material Adverse Effect shall be
         accurate, true and correct in all respects) on and as of any Subsequent
         Closing Date with the same force and effect as though made by Purchaser

         Subsequent Acquired Companies, in which case Purchaser shall indemnify
         Sellers pursuant to SECTION 10.3(c) from and against any liabilities or
         obligations of Sellers or their Affiliates arising out of or related to
         any payments made by a BellSouth Entity pursuant to a BellSouth

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   TERMINATION

9.1      TERMINATION. This  Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions
contemplated herein may be abandoned, at any time on or prior to the Initial
Closing Date:

(a) with the mutual consent of the Seller Representative and Purchaser;

(b) by the Seller Representative or Purchaser, if the Initial Closing shall not
have taken place on or before December 15, 2004, PROVIDED, that if the Initial
Closing shall not have occurred on or before December 15, 2004 solely because of
(i) the failure of (A) the parties to receive any of the Closing Required
Regulatory Approvals or (B) any applicable regulatory waiting period to expire
or (B) the imposition of any Initial Closing Legal Prohibition, such date shall
be extended to June 30, 2005 (the "OUTSIDE DATE"); PROVIDED, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this SECTION 9.1(b) shall not be available to (i)
the Seller Representative if the failure of any Seller to fulfill any of its
obligations under this Agreement, or the breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty by any Seller in this Agreement or by any Seller or
any Acquired Company in the Additional Representations Certificate, has been the
cause of or resulted in the failure of the Initial Closing to occur on or before
the Outside Date or (ii) Purchaser if the failure of Purchaser to fulfill any of
its obligations under this Agreement, or the breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty by Purchaser in this Agreement, has been the cause of
or resulted in the failure of the Initial Closing to occur on or before Outside
Date;

(c) by Purchaser, if there shall have been a material breach of any
representation or warranty of Sellers hereunder and the falsity, inaccuracy or
incorrectness of such representation or warranty would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the ability of
Sellers to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or a
material breach of any covenant or obligation of Sellers hereunder, and which in
any such case would cause the conditions to the Initial Closing set forth in
SECTIONS 7.2(a) and/or 7.2(b) not to be satisfied by the Outside Date, and in
any case such breach shall not have been remedied within thirty (30) days after
receipt by the Seller Representative of a notice in writing from Purchaser
specifying the breach and requesting that such breach be remedied;

(d) by the Seller Representative, if there shall have been a material breach of
any covenant, obligation, representation or warranty of Purchaser hereunder, and
such breach shall have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect and such breach shall
not have been remedied within thirty (30) days after receipt by Purchaser of
notice in writing from the Seller Representative specifying the breach and
requesting that such breach be remedied;

<PAGE>

(e) by Purchaser on or before the date that is 30 days after the Due Diligence
Expiration Date, if, after having completed its due diligence investigation of
the Acquired Companies in accordance with SECTION 6.2 of this Agreement,
Purchaser has discovered, from information obtained by Purchaser after the date
of this Agreement (excluding any information provided to or obtained by
Purchaser up to and including the date of this Agreement, including pursuant to
the schedules hereto), conditions, circumstances or events that have or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that if Purchaser has not exercised its right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with this SECTION 9.1(e) on or before the date that is 30 days after
the Due Diligence Expiration Date, Purchaser shall have no further right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this SECTION 9.1(e), and this Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Purchaser
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this SECTION
9.1(e) if Purchaser is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

In the event of termination by the Seller Representative or Purchaser pursuant
to this SECTION 9.1 (other than SECTION 9.1(a)), written notice thereof shall be
given to the other party.

9.2      EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
SECTION 9.1, or if Purchaser has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to SECTION 9.1 and determines not to or fails to exercise its termination rights
pursuant to SECTION 9.1, there shall be no liability hereunder on the part of
Sellers, Purchaser, nor their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives, and no party shall have any right to sue
for a breach of any representation or warranty contained herein or in the
Additional Representations Certificate, and all obligations of the parties
hereunder shall terminate except that the obligations set forth in SECTIONS
3.1(f), 6.8 (Confidentiality) 6.11 (Brokers), 6.28(b) (Non-Solicitation by
Purchaser), 12.1 (Expenses) and 12.8 (Publicity) and the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and except that no
such termination shall relieve any party from liability for any prior
intentional breach of any covenant contained in this Agreement.

9.3      NO RIGHT TO TERMINATE AFTER INITIAL CLOSING. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties agree that there is no right to terminate this Agreement once
there has been an Initial Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that the Sellers Equity Interests of one or more Acquired Companies have not
been transferred to Purchaser despite each party's compliance with all of the
covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement to be performed and
complied with by it prior to Non-Transferred Company Determination Date with
respect to such Acquired Company, then such Acquired Companies, to the extent
that they have not been deemed Non-Transferred Companies prior to their
respective Non-Transferred Company Determination Date, shall be deemed to be
Non-Transferred Companies on such Non-Transferred Company Determination Date
and, following the applicable Non-Transferred Company Determination Date, (i)
the parties shall nevertheless be obligated to consummate the Initial Closing
and any Subsequent Closing and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement except with respect to any such Non-Transferred Company, (ii) the
applicable Seller will retain and continue to hold and own its Seller Equity
Interests or Holding Company Equity Interests relating to (other than upon a
transfer of Right of First Refusal Shares of a ROFR Company), and any Sellers
Stockholder Debt with regard to, any such Non-Transferred Company, (iii) the
Sellers Equity Interests of any such Non-Transferred Company shall be deemed to
be excluded from the definition of "Sellers Equity Interests" and "Holding
Company

<PAGE>

Equity Interests" for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) no representations or
warranties shall be deemed to have been made by Sellers with respect to any such
Non-Transferred Company and (v) SECTION 9.2 (including the exceptions contained
therein) shall be deemed to apply to such Non-Transferred Companies as if this
Agreement had terminated solely with respect to such Non-Transferred Companies.
For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Non-Transferred Company
Determination Date with respect to any Retained Company, SECTIONS 6.5 and 6.6
and ARTICLE III, as well as any other provisions that would reasonably be
interpreted to treat such Non-Transferred Company as an Acquired Company whose
Sellers Equity Interests are being transferred directly or indirectly pursuant
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will no longer be applicable
to such Non-Transferred Company, PROVIDED, that SECTIONS 6.8 and 6.28, as well
as the Confidentiality Agreement, will continue to be applicable to all
Non-Transferred Companies (other than as provided otherwise in this Agreement).

                                   ARTICLE X

Subsequent Acquired Companies for a period of eighteen (18) months after the
Initial Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing Date, as the case may be, except
that (a) Tax Warranties shall survive until the Tax Statute of Limitations Date
(b) Labor Warranties and Environmental Warranties shall survive for a period of
three (3) years after the Initial Closing Date or any Subsequent Closing Date,

representation or warranty after the survival period specified therefor in this
SECTION 10.1.

under this Agreement.

of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement not involving a claim, or
the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding, of the type described in
SECTION 10.6, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days after first
becoming aware of such claim, the Indemnified Person shall give notice to the
Indemnifying Person of such claim, which notice shall specify the facts alleged
to constitute the basis for such claim, the representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations alleged to have been breached and the amount that the
Indemnified Person seeks hereunder from the Indemnifying Person, together with
such information as may be necessary for the Indemnifying Person to determine
that the limitations in SECTION 10.4 have been satisfied or do not apply;
PROVIDED, that the failure of the Indemnified Person to give such notice shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under this ARTICLE X
except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person shall have been
prejudiced thereby.

10.6     NOTICE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS; ASSUMPTION OF DEFENSE. The Indemnified
Person shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable, but in any
event no later than five (5) Business Days after receiving notice thereof, to
the Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of
any suit, action or proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto in respect of
which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement (which notice shall specify
in reasonable detail the nature and amount of such claim together with such
information as may be necessary for the Indemnifying Person to determine that
the limitations in SECTION 10.4 have been satisfied or do not apply); PROVIDED,
that the failure of the Indemnified Person to give such notice shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Person of its obligations under this ARTICLE X except to the
extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person shall have been prejudiced thereby.
The Indemnifying Person may, at its own expense, (a) participate in the defense
of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding and (b) upon notice to the
Indemnified Person, at any time during the course of any such claim, suit,
action or proceeding, assume the defense thereof with counsel of its own choice
and in the event of such assumption, shall have the exclusive right, subject to
CLAUSE (i) of SECTION 10.7, to settle or compromise such claim, suit, action or
proceeding. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such defense, the Indemnified
Person shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense
thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnifying Person, and such Indemnified Person will refrain
from making any public announcements in respect of such claim, suit, action or
proceeding or otherwise communicating with the news media without the prior
consent of the Indemnifying Person. Whether or not the Indemnifying Person
chooses to defend or prosecute any such claim, suit, action or proceeding, all
of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Sellers
shall continue to control the defense of the Venezuelan Arbitration and the
prosecution of

<PAGE>

the Peruvian Arbitration in all respects following the applicable Closing with
respect to the Venezuelan Arbitration Entities and the Peruvian Acquired
Companies.

10.7     SETTLEMENT OR COMPROMISE. Any settlement or compromise made or caused
to be made by the Indemnified Person (unless the Indemnifying Person has the
exclusive right to settle or compromise under CLAUSE (b) of SECTION 10.6) or the
Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, of any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding of the kind referred to in SECTION 10.6 shall also be binding upon
the Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified Person, as the case may be, in the
same manner as if a final judgment or decree had been entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or compromise; PROVIDED,
that (a) no obligation, restriction or Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnified
Person as a result of such settlement or compromise without its prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (b) the
Indemnified Person will not compromise or settle any claim, suit, action or
proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

10.8     TIME LIMITS. Any right to indemnification or other recovery under this
ARTICLE X shall only apply to Losses with respect to which the Indemnified
Person shall have notified the Indemnifying Person within the applicable time
period set forth in SECTION 10.2 or 10.3, as the case may be. If any claim for
indemnification or other recovery is timely asserted under this ARTICLE X, the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to bring an action, suit or proceeding
with respect to such claim within one year after first giving the Indemnifying
Person notice thereof, but may not bring any such action, suit or proceeding
thereafter.

10.9     NET LOSSES AND SUBROGATION; OFFSET.

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the amount of any
Losses incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Person shall be based on actual
Losses incurred and shall be calculated after giving effect to (i) any insurance
proceeds received by the Indemnified Person from any insurance policy provided
or maintained by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies, Sellers, Seller Parent
or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to such Losses, (ii) any net
Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Person arising from the facts or
circumstances giving rise to such Losses and (iii) any recoveries obtained by
the Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) from any other third party.
Each Indemnified Person shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such proceeds, benefits and recoveries, and to take all reasonable actions to
mitigate the amount of any Losses incurred or suffered by such Indemnified
Person. If any such proceeds, benefits or recoveries are received by an
Indemnified Person with respect to any Losses after an Indemnifying Person has
made a payment to the Indemnified Person with respect thereto, the Indemnified
Person shall promptly, but in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days
after the receipt, realization or recovery of such proceeds, benefits or
recoveries, pay to the Indemnifying Person the amount of such proceeds, benefits
or recoveries (up to the amount of the Indemnifying Person's payment).

(b) Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Person in respect of any Losses,
the Indemnifying Person will, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to
all rights of the Indemnified Person against any third party in respect of the
Losses to which such payment

<PAGE>

relates. Such Indemnified Person and Indemnifying Person will execute upon
request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence or further perfect such
subrogation rights.

(c) If a judgment is rendered in favor of the Peruvian Acquired Companies or any
of their successors or Affiliates in the Peruvian Arbitration (the amount of any
such judgment, the "PERUVIAN ARBITRATION AWARD"), the entirety of the Peruvian
Arbitration Award shall be paid, or cause to be paid, by Purchaser to Sellers no
later than two (2) Business Days following receipt thereof by Purchaser of the
Peruvian Acquired Companies, as the case may be.

10.10    ADJUSTMENTS TO AGGREGATE SELLERS ALLOCATED PAYMENT. To the extent
permitted by Law, any amounts payable under SECTION 10.2, or SECTION 10.3 shall
be treated by Purchaser and Sellers as an adjustment to the Aggregate Sellers
Allocated Payment.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                             SELLER PARENT GUARANTY

11.1     SELLERS GUARANTY.

(a) Seller Parent hereby unconditionally, absolutely, continuously and
irrevocably guarantees, as a primary obligor and not as a surety, to Purchaser
and any Purchaser Indemnified Person the due and punctual payment and
performance by each Seller of all of its covenants, agreements, obligations and
liabilities arising under or pursuant to this Agreement and the other Related
Agreements (or any of them), whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent,
now or hereafter existing, or due or to become due (collectively, the "SELLERS
LIABILITIES").

(b) Neither Purchaser nor any Purchaser Indemnified Person shall be required to
prosecute collection or seek to enforce or resort to any remedies against any
Seller or any other Person liable to Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified
Person on account of Sellers Liabilities or any guaranty thereof. Sellers
Liabilities shall in no way be impaired, affected, reduced or released by reason
of (i) the failure or delay by Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person to
do or take any of the actions or things described in this Agreement or the other
Related Agreements, or (ii) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution, sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of
any Seller or the marshaling of assets and liabilities, receivership,
insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization,
arrangement, composition with creditors or readjustment of, or other similar
proceedings or any other inability to pay or perform affecting, any Seller or
any of its respective assets, or any allegation concerning, or contest of the
legality or validity of, the indemnification obligations under this Agreement or
any of the other Related Agreements.

11.2     SELLER WAIVERS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.

(a) Seller Parent waives any and all right to assert against Purchaser or any
Purchaser Indemnified Person any claim or defense with respect to the legality,
validity or enforceability of this ARTICLE XI based upon any failure of
Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person to furnish to Seller Parent any
information or facts relating to the ability of any Sellers to pay and perform
the applicable Sellers Liabilities. Seller Parent acknowledges receipt of an
executed or conformed copy of each Related Agreement and agrees that such copy
constitutes adequate

<PAGE>

notice of all matters contained therein and consents to the execution and
delivery of such agreements and the performance of all transactions provided for
or contemplated therein.

(b) Seller Parent waives all defenses, counterclaims and offsets of any kind or
nature in connection with the legality, validity and/or enforceability of this
ARTICLE XI, including any such defense, counterclaim or offset arising directly
or indirectly from any agreement, instrument or document executed and delivered
by any Sellers. Seller Parent waives presentment, demand, notice of dishonor,
protest and all other notices whatsoever, other than notices required by the
terms of this ARTICLE XI.

(c) Seller Parent waives any and all right to assert against Purchaser or any
Purchaser Indemnified Person any claim or defense based upon any election of
remedies by Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person which in any manner
impairs, affects, reduces, releases or extinguishes either Seller Parent's right
to proceed against any Seller for reimbursement or any other rights of Seller
Parent against any Seller or against any other Person.

(d) Seller Parent waives notice of the following events or occurrences, and
agrees that its guarantee obligations under this Agreement shall be continuing,
absolute and unconditional and shall remain in full force and effect until all
of the obligations of Sellers under this Agreement and the other Related
Agreements have been completely discharged irrespective of: (i) acceptance of
the provisions of this ARTICLE XI by Purchaser and any Purchaser Indemnified
Person; (ii) Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person heretofore, now or at
any time hereafter obtaining, releasing, waiving or modifying any other Person's
guaranty of Sellers Liabilities given to any of them; (iii) amendment or
modification of any of the Related Agreements, or waiver or release of any
provisions of the Related Agreements by Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified
Person; (iv) presentment, demand, notices of default, nonpayment, partial
payment and protest, and all other notices or formalities to which Seller Parent
may be entitled, other than notices required by the terms of this ARTICLE XI;
(v) Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person heretofore, now or at any time
hereafter, granting to any Seller (or any other Person liable to Purchaser or
any Purchaser Indemnified Person on account of Sellers Liabilities) any
indulgence or extension of time of payment of Sellers Liabilities; (vi)
Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person heretofore, now or at any time
hereafter, accepting from any Seller or any other Person any partial payment or
payments on account of Sellers Liabilities or Purchaser or any Purchaser
Indemnified Person settling, subordinating, compromising, discharging or
releasing the same; and (vii) any other circumstance which might otherwise
constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor other than
the determination that all of Sellers' obligations have been paid in full in
cash.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller Parent shall be
entitled to the benefit of and may assert as a defense against any claim under
this Agreement any limitation, defense, set off or counterclaim that any Seller
could have asserted, other than defenses based upon or relating to (i) any
Seller's insolvency, bankruptcy or similar inability to pay or perform or (ii)
the due authorization, execution, delivery, enforceability or validity of this
Agreement or any of the other Related Agreements by or against any Seller.

11.3     REMEDIES. If Sellers Liabilities are not paid or performed forthwith by
Seller Parent to Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Person at
Purchaser's principal

<PAGE>

place of business, Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Person may
proceed to arbitration against Seller Parent. At Purchaser's election, one or
more successive or concurrent arbitration proceedings may be brought hereunder
by Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnified Person against Seller Parent, whether
or not an arbitration proceeding has been commenced against any Seller. In any
such arbitration proceeding any Seller may be joined (but need not be joined) as
a party with Seller Parent. In addition, subject to SECTION 12.14, Purchaser or
any Purchaser Indemnified Person may exercise any other right or remedy provided
by Law for breach of this Agreement by Seller Parent.

11.4     MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS, SALES.

(a) Seller Parent covenants that if it dissolves or otherwise disposes of all or
substantially all its assets or consolidates with or merges into another Person
or entity, then it will cause the surviving or successor Person to assume in
writing its obligations herein.

(b) If a consolidation, merger or sale or other transfer is made as permitted by
this SECTION 11.4, the provisions of this SECTION 11.4 shall continue in full
force and effect and no further consolidation, merger or sale or other transfer
shall be made except in compliance with the provisions of this SECTION 11.4.

                                   ARTICLE XII

amended, modified or supplemented but only in writing signed by Purchaser and
Sellers.

<PAGE>

12.6     ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns; PROVIDED, that no assignment of any rights or obligations hereunder, by
operation of law or otherwise, shall be made by either party without the written
consent of the other parties except Purchaser may assign its rights or interests
hereunder or delegate its obligations hereunder to any of its Affiliates
organized in Spain, PROVIDED that (x) any such Affiliate agrees in writing to be
bound by all of the terms, conditions and provisions contained herein, and (y)
Purchaser shall remain liable for all such delegated obligations under this

12.8     PUBLICITY. Prior to the Initial Closing Date, no public announcement or
other publicity regarding the existence of this Agreement or its contents or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be made by Purchaser, Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, representatives or

case, as to form, content, timing and manner of distribution or publication. On
and after the Initial Closing Date, each of Sellers and Purchaser agree to hold

12.11    ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING. This Agreement and the Related Agreements set

<PAGE>

rule of strict construction is to be applied against any of the parties.

12.13    APPLICABLE LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without

12.14    ARBITRATION.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in SECTION 2.4, any dispute or claim arising

agree otherwise. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. All
documents and testimony offered into evidence during the arbitration shall be
offered in the English language and, if necessary, shall be translated into

(c) The arbitral tribunal shall have no power to alter or modify any terms or
provisions of this Agreement, or to render any award which, by its terms or
effects, would alter any term or provision of this Agreement or to act as
amiable compositeur or ex aequo et bono. The arbitral tribunal shall, however,
have the exclusive authority to decide the scope of its own jurisdiction and the
scope of the arbitral proceedings.

(d) The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of three arbitrators to be selected
in accordance with the ICC Rules.

(e) Notwithstanding SECTION 12.1, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its attorneys' fees, and expenses for the arbitration proceedings, as
well as for any ancillary proceeding, including a proceeding to compel or enjoin
the arbitration, to request interim measures, or to confirm or set aside an
award. The losing party shall bear all costs of the arbitration proceedings,
including all fees and expenses of the arbitrators. The arbitral panel shall be
the exclusive judge of whether a party qualifies as a prevailing party for
purposes of this provision.

(f) The award may include interest from the date of any breach or violation of
this Agreement, as determined by the arbitral tribunal, until paid in full, at
the interest rate established in the award. Interest may be compounded at the
discretion of the arbitral tribunal.

(g) The award shall be in writing and state the reasons upon which it is based.
Any monetary award shall be made in Dollars. The award shall be final and
binding on the parties. Judgment on the award may be entered by any court having
jurisdiction over the person or the property of the person against whom
enforcement of the judgment is sought.

<PAGE>

(h) For purposes of this SECTION 12.14, each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby irrevocably submits and consents to the jurisdiction of the federal
courts of New York, New York.

(i) No arbitration under this Agreement shall include, by consolidation, joinder
or any other manner, any person or entity not a party to this Agreement, unless
(i) the dispute involving the person or entity is substantially related to the
dispute being arbitrated under this Agreement and involves a common question of
fact or law, and (ii) the presence of such person or entity is required if
complete relief is to be accorded in the arbitration. If a separate arbitration
is commenced between any of the parties to this Agreement under any Related
Agreement, it shall be consolidated with any arbitration pending under this
Agreement, unless the arbitral tribunal determines that justice requires that
such arbitrations not be consolidated.

12.15    SCHEDULES. Any information disclosed pursuant to any Schedule hereto or
to the Additional Representations Certificate shall be deemed to be disclosed to
Purchaser for all purposes of this Agreement. Neither the specification of any
Dollar amount in any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor
the inclusion of any specific item or matter in any Schedule hereto or to the
Additional Representations Certificate is intended to imply that such amount, or
higher or lower amounts, or the item or matter so included or other items or
matters, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting
forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in any Schedule hereto or to the
Additional Representations Certificate is or is not material for purposes of
this Agreement. Unless this Agreement specifically provides otherwise, neither
the specification of any item or matter in any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item or matter in
any Schedule hereto or to the Additional Representations Certificate is intended
to imply that such item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in
the ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the setting
forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any dispute or controversy
between the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
herein or included in any Schedule hereto or to the Additional Representations
Certificate is or is not in the ordinary course of business for purposes of this
Agreement. Sellers may, from time to time prior to or at the Initial Closing or
any Subsequent Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, supplement or amend any Schedule, including one or more supplements
or amendments to correct any matter which would constitute a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation contained herein. No such
supplemental or amended Schedule shall be deemed to cure any breach for purposes
of SECTION 7.2(a). If, however, the Initial Closing and any Subsequent Closing
occurs, any such supplement and amendment will be effective to cure and correct
for all other purposes any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation which would have existed if Seller had not made such supplement or
amendment, and all references to any Schedule hereto which is supplemented or
amended as provided in this SECTION 12.15 shall for all purposes after the
applicable Closing be deemed to be a reference to such Schedule as so
supplemented or amended.

12.16    MUTUAL RELEASE.

Companies that are the subject of such Closing to, voluntarily and
unconditionally release and forever discharge the Sellers and their respective
successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries and other Affiliates, and all of
their respective current and former officers, directors, employees, agents and

and demands of the Acquired Companies, Purchaser or their Affiliates, related to
the Acquired Companies or their subsidiaries or Affiliates, or their businesses

the time any such Acquired Company (or any predecessor of any such Acquired
Company) was formed or otherwise organized to and including, with respect to any
Acquired Company, the Closing Date.

(b) As of each Closing Date, Sellers shall voluntarily and unconditionally
release and forever discharge Purchaser and the Acquired Companies that are the
subject of such Closing from any and all actions, causes of action, suits,
debts, claims and demands of the Sellers related to such Acquired Companies or
their businesses (except for rights or obligations arising under this Agreement
or the Related Agreements, including under ARTICLE X, and fraud and willful
misconduct) that arise out of acts, events, conditions or omissions occurring or
existing from the time any such Acquired Company (or any predecessor of any such
Acquired Company) was formed or otherwise organized to and including, with
respect to any Acquired Company, the applicable Closing Date.

12.17    SELLER REPRESENTATIVE.

REPRESENTATIVE"). Seller Parent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to

(b) Each Seller hereby authorizes the Seller Representative to make all
decisions and take all actions on its behalf to administer the transactions
contemplated hereby (except to the extent that this Agreement specifically
