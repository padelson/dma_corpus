the Closing, except any Excluded Liabilities.

  



  

2.4 _Excluded Liabilities_. Buyer shall not and does not assume any Liability

(a) all Liabilities related to the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Second

2.5 _Non-Assignment of Assumed Contracts_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign or transfer and shall not effect the
assignment or transfer of any Assumed Contract if (a) an attempted assignment
thereof, without the approval, authorization or consent of, or granting or
issuance of any license or permit by, any third party thereto (each such
action, a " _Necessary Consent_ "), would constitute a breach thereof or in
any way adversely affect the rights of Buyer thereunder and (b) the
Bankruptcy Court shall not have entered an Order providing that such
Necessary Consent is not required. In such event, Sellers and Buyer will
use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Necessary Consents
with respect to any such Assumed Contract or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder for the assignment thereof to Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer as Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Sellers shall not be obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any
third party from whom consent or approval is requested or to initiate any
litigation or legal proceedings to obtain any such consent or approval.

  



        
   

  



  

If such Necessary Consent is not obtained, or if an attempted assignment of
any Assumed Contract would be ineffective or would adversely affect the
rights of any Seller thereunder so that Buyer or an Affiliate designated by
Buyer would not in fact receive all such rights, such Seller and Buyer or the
applicable Affiliate of Buyer will cooperate in a mutually agreeable
arrangement, to the extent feasible and at no expense to such Seller, under
which Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume
the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, including
subcontracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to Buyer or such Affiliate of
Buyer, or under which such Seller would enforce for the benefit of Buyer or
such Affiliate of Buyer with Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer assuming such
Sellers Liabilities in respect of the applicable Assumed Contract and any
and all rights of such Seller against a third party thereto. Nothing in this
Section 2.5 shall prohibit Sellers from ceasing operations or winding up
their affairs following the Closing.

(15) Business Days after the entry of the sale order by the Bankruptcy Court
with respect to the Alternative Transaction involving the Successful Bidder.
In the event that Buyer is the Back-Up Bidder following the Auction, the
Escrow Agent shall return the Deposit Escrow to Buyer within two (2) Business

3.3 _Purchase Price_. In consideration for the Acquired Assets, and subject

Liabilities as provided in Section 2.3 and at the Closing shall pay to
Sellers an aggregate cash purchase price of (a) $1,100,000,000.00 (the "
_Base Purchase Price_ ") _plus_ (b) the estimated Adjustment Amount as of
immediately prior to Closing (the " _Estimated Adjustment Amount_ ", and the
sum of clause (a) and clause (b), as the same may be reduced pursuant to
Section 3.5, the " _Purchase Price_ "). The calculation of the Estimated
Adjustment Amount shall be prepared by Sellers in good faith and delivered to
Buyer no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. On the
Closing Date, a portion of the Base Purchase Price equal to the Adjustment
Escrow Amount shall be deposited with the Escrow Agent to be held and
disbursed pursuant to the terms of the Adjustment Escrow Agreement and
Section 3.4.

  



  

3.4 _Net Working Capital Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Sellers the calculation of the final Adjustment Amount as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Final Adjustment Amount_ "). The
Final Adjustment Amount shall be calculated in accordance with the principles
and methodologies set forth in _Schedule 3.4_. Buyer shall, in a
timely manner, provide Sellers such data and information as Sellers may
reasonably request in writing to support such calculation of the Final
Adjustment Amount.

  



  

(b) The calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount shall become final and
binding on the date (the " _Final Settlement Date_ ") that is thirty (30)
days following receipt thereof by Sellers unless Sellers give written notice
of disagreement (" _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to

  



        
   

  



  

Buyer prior to such date; _provided_ that all such items that are not
disputed shall be final and binding upon the Parties.  In order to be
effective, a Notice of Disagreement must specify in reasonable detail the
dollar amount, nature and basis of any disagreement so asserted. If a Notice
of Disagreement is received by Buyer in a timely manner, then the calculation
of the Final Adjustment Amount (as revised in accordance with paragraph (d)
below, if applicable) shall become final and binding on, and the Final
Settlement Date shall be, the earlier of (i) the date upon which Sellers and
Buyer agree in writing with respect to all matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement and (ii) the date upon which the calculation of the Final
Adjustment Amount is issued by the Neutral Arbitrator.

  



  

(c) During the first twenty (20) days following the date upon which Buyer
receives a Notice of Disagreement, Sellers and Buyer shall attempt in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect
to all matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of such
twenty (20) day period (or earlier by mutual agreement to arbitrate) Buyer
and Sellers have not reached agreement on such matters, the matters that
remain in dispute shall be submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator for review and
resolution. The terms of appointment and engagement of the Neutral Arbitrator
shall be as agreed upon in good faith between the Parties and any associated
engagement fees shall initially be borne fifty percent (50%) by Sellers and
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer; _provided_ that such fees shall ultimately be
allocated in accordance with the fee sharing provisions set forth below in
this Section 3.4(c). The hearing date will be scheduled by the Neutral
Arbitrator as soon as reasonably practicable, and shall be conducted on a
confidential basis. Each of Buyer and Sellers shall, not later than seven (7)
days prior to the hearing date set by the Neutral Arbitrator, submit a brief
(to include such Partys calculations with regard to amounts in dispute in
the calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount) for settlement of any amounts
set forth in the Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute. The Neutral
Arbitrator shall render a decision resolving the matters in dispute on the
basis of the principles and methodologies set forth in _Schedule 3.4_ (which
decision shall include a written statement of findings and conclusions)
within ten (10) Business Days after the conclusion of the hearing, unless the
Parties reach agreement prior thereto and withdraw the dispute from
arbitration. The Neutral Arbitrator shall provide to the Parties explanations
in writing of the reasons for its decisions regarding the Final Adjustment
Amount and shall issue the calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount
reflecting such decisions. The decision of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be
final and binding on the Parties. If the Neutral Arbitrator resolves all
disputes presented to it entirely in the manner proposed by either Sellers or
Buyer, as the case may be, the fees and expenses of the Neutral Arbitrator
shall be borne by the non-prevailing Party. In all other events, the fees and
expenses of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be shared based on the difference
between Sellers position, on the one hand, and Buyers position, on the
other hand, initially presented to the Neutral Arbitrator (based on the
aggregate of all differences taken as a whole) and the final resolution as
determined by the Neutral Arbitrator in proportion to the total difference
between Sellers and Buyers initial positions. The fees and disbursements
of Buyers independent public accountants incurred in connection with
the procedures performed with respect to the calculation of the Final
Adjustment Amount shall be borne by Buyer and the fees and disbursements of
Sellers independent public accountants incurred in connection with their
preparation of the Notice of Disagreement shall be borne by Sellers.

  



  

(d) If the Final Adjustment Amount is less than the Estimated Adjustment
Amount, the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount of such
difference, and Buyer and

  



        
   

  



  

Holdings shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay
to Buyer an amount equal to the absolute value of such difference from the
Adjustment Escrow Amount not later than three (3) Business Days after the
Final Settlement Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts specified by Buyer; and (x) in the event that the amount
due to Buyer exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount, Sellers shall pay such
excess amount to Buyer not later than three (3) Business Days after the Final
Settlement Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts specified by Buyer or (y) in the event that the Adjustment Escrow
Amount exceeds the amount due to Buyer pursuant to this Section 3.4, such
excess amount shall be released to Sellers not later than three (3) Business
Days after the Final Settlement Date by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts specified by Holdings.

  



  

(e) If the Final Adjustment Amount is more than the Estimated Adjustment
Amount, the Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of such
difference and (x) Buyer and Holdings shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay to Sellers the entire Adjustment
Escrow Amount not later than three (3) Business Days after the Final
Settlement Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts specified by Holdings and (y) Buyer shall pay the amount by which
the Final Adjustment Amount is more than the Estimated Adjustment Amount to
Sellers not later than three (3) Business Days after the Final Settlement
Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts specified by Holdings.

  



  

3.5 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The sum of the Purchase Price and the
value of the Assumed Liabilities (to the extent properly taken into account
under the Code) shall be allocated among the Acquired Assets in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (and any similar provision of state or local Law, as appropriate)
(the " _Allocation_ "). The Allocation shall be delivered by Buyer to Sellers
within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date. Sellers will have the right to
raise reasonable objections to the Allocation within thirty (30) days after
Buyers delivery thereof, in which event Buyer and Sellers will negotiate in
good faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer and Sellers cannot resolve such
dispute within fifteen (15) days after Sellers notify Buyer of such
objections, such dispute with respect to the Allocation shall be resolved
promptly by a nationally recognized accounting firm selected by Buyer and

Sellers, each such lease, ground lease, sublease, license, option or other
agreement is in full force and effect. Sellers are not in

options or other agreements, and no condition exists which (with notice or
lapse of time or both) would constitute a default by any Seller thereunder or
(to the Knowledge of Sellers) by the other parties thereto, in each case,

a Sellers Material Adverse Effect. Sellers have not subleased or
otherwise granted any Person the right to use or occupy any Leased Real

Sellers Material Adverse Effect and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, each such
instrument is in full force and effect. Sellers are not in material default
under any such instruments, and no condition exists which (with notice or
lapse of time or both) would constitute a default by any Seller thereunder or
(to the Knowledge of Sellers) by the other parties thereto, in each

other exceptions to title disclosed in the Mystic Station Title Insurance
Commitment, the Mystic 8and9 Title Insurance Commitment, or the Fore River
Title Insurance Commitment (collectively, " _Easements_ "), and, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, the other parties to such Easements are not in breach
or default in any material respect thereunder (and in each such case no event
exists that with the passage of time or the giving of notice would constitute
such material breach or default), and (ii) no Seller has received notice from
any other party to any Easement of any threatened termination of any such
Easement.

Transaction as a result of a breach or failure to perform on the part of such
Successful Bidder, then Buyer, if Buyer is the Back-Up Bidder, will be deemed
to have the new prevailing bid, and Sellers will be authorized, without
further order of the Bankruptcy Court, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement (as the same may be improved upon by the Buyer in the
Auction) with the Back-Up Bidder.

  



  

6.4 _Access_. Subject to applicable Law, during the Interim Period, Sellers
(a) shall give Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the offices, properties, officers, employees, accountants,
auditors, counsel and other representatives, books and records of Sellers,
(b) shall furnish to Buyer and its Representatives such financial, operating
and property data related to the Acquired Assets and other information as
Buyer and its Representatives reasonably request, and (c) shall cooperate
reasonably with Buyer in its investigation of the Business. It
is acknowledged and understood that no investigation by Buyer or other
information received by Buyer shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect
any representation, warranty or other agreement given or made by
Sellers hereunder. Buyer agrees that any on-site inspections of any Acquired
Real Property shall be conducted in the presence of Sellers or their
Representatives. All inspections shall be conducted so as not to interfere
unreasonably with the use of the Acquired Real Property by Sellers.
Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold Sellers and their Affiliates and their
respective Representatives harmless of and from all actions, suits,
claims, investigations, fines, judgments, damages, losses, deficiencies,
liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) that
arise out of or relate to physical injuries arising from Buyers inspection
of the Acquired Assets (other than to the extent any of the foregoing results
from the gross negligence or the willful misconduct of the Person seeking
such indemnification), and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, such obligation to indemnify shall survive Closing or
any termination of this Agreement. All information obtained pursuant to this
Section 6.4 shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

6.5 _Public Announcements_. Buyer and Sellers will consult with each other
before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment

approval of the other Party, in each case except as may be required by Law,
court process (including the filing of this Agreement with the

applicable, shall file all necessary documentation and returns with respect
to such Transfer Taxes when due, and shall promptly, following the filing
thereof, furnish a copy of such return or other filing and a copy of
a receipt showing payment of any such Transfer Tax to the other

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties shall petition the Bankruptcy
Court to provide that the sale, transfer, assignment and conveyance of the
Acquired Assets to Buyer hereunder shall be entitled to the protections
afforded under Section 1146(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, and Buyer shall either
be reimbursed by Sellers with respect to any Transfer Taxes paid by Buyer and
reimbursed to Sellers that are not required to be paid as a result of the
Bankruptcy Code Section 1146(a) or that are refunded to Sellers.

  



  

(b) All Property Taxes with respect to the Acquired Assets shall be borne by
Buyer. Buyer shall file all Tax Returns relating to Property Taxes with

preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the Closing from occurring as
promptly as practicable. Buyer and Sellers shall not, and shall cause their

discussion and (iii) subject to the attorney-client and similar applicable
privileges, furnish outside legal counsel for the other Parties with copies

days prior to the Closing Date, for a period of at least twelve months (the "
_Minimum Employment Period_ "), at aggregate levels of wages and overall

provisions under any employee benefit plan or compensation arrangements
maintained or sponsored by or contributed to by Buyer for such Non-
Represented Employees after the Closing Date to the extent that

employee welfare benefit plans any deductibles or co-insurance paid by each
Non-Represented Employee under Sellers welfare benefit plans during the
current plan year.

  



  

(d) Nothing in this Section 6.8 shall create any third party beneficiary
right in any Person other than the parties to this Agreement, including any
current or former Employee, any participant in any Benefit Plan, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or any right to continued employment with
any Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this

cooperate with the others and shall provide to the others such documentation,
information and assistance as is reasonably necessary to effect the
provisions of this Section 6.8.

provided, following the Closing Date, Sellers shall execute and deliver to
Buyer such bills of sale, endorsements, assignments and other good
and sufficient instruments of assignment, transfer and conveyance, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and take such additional
actions as Buyer may reasonably request to vest in Buyer all of Sellers
right, title and interest in and to the Acquired Assets. Seller and Buyer
shall also cooperate in the transition of operational matters in respect of
the Facilities.

  



  

6.10 _Post-Closing Wind-Up_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Closing, Sellers shall take such actions as may be required or advisable
(which may involve the formation of a liquidation trust or similar vehicle)
to avoid the use of any trade names or other property that is an Acquired
Asset (including amending their organization documents to change their names)
and to accomplish the liquidation and winding-up of their estates (the "
_Wind-Up_ ") as expeditiously and as efficiently as reasonably possible. At
the request of Buyer, Sellers will keep Buyer apprised of all material
developments with respect to the Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities in

the Bankruptcy Court waiving compliance) with all requirements under the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, the Local
Bankruptcy Rules and the Asset Sale Guidelines in connection with obtaining
approval of the Bidding Procedures Order and the Sale Order.  Sellers shall
consult with Buyer and its Representatives concerning the Bidding Procedures

others, of providing necessary assurances of performance by Buyer under this
Agreement and demonstrating that Buyer is a "good faith" purchaser under
section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code; _provided_ , _however_ , in no event
shall Buyer or Sellers be required to agree to any amendment of this
Agreement.

  



  

(c) No later than ten (10) Business Days after the Agreement Date, Sellers

including all supporting pages, and shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to have the Bankruptcy Court enter the Bidding Procedures Order
within forty-five (45) days from the filing date of the Sale Motion, subject
to availability of the Bankruptcy Court (and only to the extent permitted by

  



        
   

  



  

the Asset Sale Guidelines and the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Rules

(xiv) Buyer shall have no liability or responsibility for any liability or
other obligation of Sellers arising under or related to the Acquired Assets
other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement, including successor or
vicarious liabilities of any kind or character, including, but not limited
to, any theory of antitrust, environmental, successor or transferee

Agreement, or in any way prevent or interfere with the consummation or
performance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

6.12 _Cure Amounts_. Sellers shall transfer and assign all Assumed Contracts
to Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer designated by Buyer, and Buyer or such
designated Affiliate of Buyer shall assume all Assumed Contracts from
Sellers, as of the Closing Date pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code and the Sale Order. As promptly as practicable following the
date hereof, Buyer and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate and determine the amounts required to cure all defaults under
each Assumed Contract so as to permit the assumption and assignment of each
such Assumed Contract pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code in
connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement (as
ultimately determined by the Bankruptcy Court, the " _Cure Amounts_ "). In
connection with the assignment and assumption of the Assumed Contracts,
Sellers shall cure any defaults under the Assumed Contracts by payment of any
Cure Amounts (or create reserves therefor) as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court
; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of
any Cure Amounts or other costs that arise as a result of Buyer modifying
_Schedule 2.1(c)_ after the signing of this Agreement to add other Contracts
to _Schedule 2.1(c)_ (the " _Additional Contracts_ "). Buyer shall be
additionally responsible for any and all the expenses incurred by the Sellers
from the date the Sale Order is entered through and including the date on
which an order is entered rejecting the Additional Contracts.
 Notwithstanding the payment of the Cure Amounts by Sellers or Buyer
(if applicable), Buyer or its designated Affiliate shall be responsible
for demonstrating and establishing adequate assurance of future performance
before the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the Assumed Contracts. For the

6.13 _Preservation of Records_. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide
to Sellers (including, any trust established under a chapter 11 plan of
Sellers or any other successors of Sellers) and their respective Affiliates
and Representatives (after reasonable notice and during normal business hours
and without charge to Sellers other than the costs of copying, if any) access
to, including the right to make copies of, all Records included in the
Acquired Assets for periods prior to the Closing and shall preserve such
Records until the later of (i) such period as shall be consistent with
Guarantors records retention policy in effect from time to time, (ii) the
required retention period required by applicable Law, (iii) the conclusion of
all bankruptcy proceedings relating to the Chapter 11 Cases or (iv) in
the case of Records relating to Taxes, the expiration of the statute of
limitations applicable to such Taxes. Such access shall include access to
any information in electronic form to the extent reasonably available. Buyer
acknowledges that Sellers have the right to retain originals or copies of all
of Records included in the Acquired Assets for periods prior to the Closing.
With respect to any Claims related to Excluded Liabilities, Buyer shall
render all reasonable assistance that Sellers may request in defending such
Claim (at Sellers expense) and shall make available to Sellers personnel
most knowledgeable about the matter in question.

  



        
   

  



  

6.14 _Risk of Loss_. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.14,
during the Interim Period all risk of loss or damage to the property included
in the Acquired Assets shall, as between Buyer and Sellers, be borne by
Sellers. If during the Interim Period the Acquired Assets are damaged by fire
or other casualty (each such event, an " _Event of Loss_ "), or are taken by
a Governmental Entity by exercise of the power of eminent domain (each, a "
_Taking_ "), then the following provisions of this Section 6.14 shall apply:

  



  

(a) In the case of the occurrence of (i) any one or more Events of Loss, as a
result of which the aggregate costs to restore, repair or replace the
Facilities or the Acquired Assets subject to such Event of Loss to a
condition substantially equivalent to their prior condition, and the amount
of any lost profits reasonably expected to accrue after Closing as a result
of such Event of Loss, less any insurance proceeds received by Sellers in
connection with such Event or Events of Loss ( _provided_ that any insurance
proceeds received in connection with an Event or Events of Loss are either
used to restore, repair or replace such Event or Events of Loss or made
available to Buyer) and less any Tax benefits actually realized by Buyer in
connection with such Event or Events of Loss, such amount pursuant to this
clause (i) to be determined by an independent third party appraiser selected
by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to Sellers (collectively, " _Restoration
Costs_ ") and/or (ii) any one or more Takings, as a result of which the value
of the property subject to such Taking and the amount of any lost profits
reasonably expected to accrue after Closing as a result of such Taking, less
any condemnation award received by Buyer ( _provided_ that any such
condemnation award is made available to Buyer) and less any Tax benefits
actually realized by Buyer in connection with such Taking, such amount
pursuant to this clause (ii) to be determined by an independent third party
appraiser selected by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to Sellers
(collectively, the " _Condemnation Value_ "), if the sum of all Restoration
Costs and Condemnation Value, in the aggregate, is less than or equal to one
percent (1%) of the Base Purchase Price, such Event of Loss and/or Takings
shall have no effect on the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(b) Subject to the termination right of Buyer and Sellers set forth in clause
(d) below, upon the occurrence of any one or more Events of Loss and/or
Takings involving aggregate Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value in
excess of one percent (1%) of the Base Purchase Price (a " _Major Loss_ "),
Sellers shall have, in the case of a Major Loss relating solely to one or
more Events of Loss, the option, exercised by notice to Buyer, to restore,
repair or replace the damaged Acquired Assets prior to Closing to a condition
substantially equivalent to their prior condition. If Sellers elect to so
restore, repair or replace the Acquired Assets relating to a Major
Loss, which election shall be made by notice to Buyer prior to the Closing
Date and as soon as practicable following the occurrence of the Major Loss,
Sellers will complete or cause to be completed the repair, replacement or
restoration of the damaged Acquired Assets prior to the Closing and the
Closing Date shall be postponed for the amount of time reasonably necessary
to complete the restoration, repair or replacement of such Acquired Assets as
reasonably agreed among Buyer and Sellers (including, if necessary, the
extension of the date contemplated by Section 8.1(b)(i) to allow for the
restoration, repair or replacement of such Acquired Assets).  If Sellers
elect not to cause the restoration, repair or replacement of the Acquired
Assets affected by a Major Loss, or such Major Loss is the result in whole or
in part of one or more Takings or is otherwise not capable of being restored,
repaired or replaced, the provisions of Section 6.14(c) will apply.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) Subject to the termination right of Buyer and Sellers set forth in clause
(d) below, in the event that Sellers elect not to cause the restoration,
repair or replacement of a Major Loss, or in the event that Sellers, having
elected to cause repair, replacement or restoration of the Major Loss, fail
to cause its completion within the period of time agreed upon by the Parties
pursuant to Section 6.14(b), or in the event that a Major Loss is the result
in whole or in part of one or more Takings or is otherwise not capable of
being restored, repaired or replaced, then the Parties shall, within thirty
(30) days following Sellers election not to cause the restoration, repair or
replacement, failure to complete, or the occurrence of such Major Loss, as
the case may be, adjust the Purchase Price by the aggregate Restoration Cost
and Condemnation Value related thereto, as mitigated by any repair,
replacement or restoration work actually completed by Sellers, on the
Acquired Assets being sold to Buyer, and proceed to Closing (in which case
all insurance proceeds and/or condemnation awards related to such Major Loss
shall be assigned to Buyer). To assist Buyer in its evaluation of any and all
Events of Loss, Sellers shall provide Buyer such access to the
Acquired Assets and such information as Buyer may reasonably request in
connection therewith.

  



  

(d) In the event that the aggregate Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value
with respect to one or more Events of Loss and/or Takings equals an amount in
excess of ten percent (10%) of the Base Purchase Price, then either Buyer or
Sellers shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon Notice to the
other Parties.

  



  

6.15 _No Reliance_.

  



  

(a) Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an
independent investigation of the business, operations, technology, assets,
prospects, financial condition, liabilities, results of operations and
projected operations of the Business and the nature and condition of Sellers
properties, assets and businesses and, in making the determination to proceed
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has relied solely on
the results of its own independent investigation and the representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that Sellers have
provided Buyer with access to the personnel, properties, premises and books
and records of the Business. In entering into this Agreement, Buyer
has relied solely upon its own investigation and analysis, and Buyer
acknowledges that none of Sellers, their respective Affiliates or any other
Person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the
accuracy or completeness of any information (including any projections,
estimates or other forward-looking information) regarding Sellers, the
Acquired Assets, the Business or other matters that is not expressly and
specifically included in this Agreement (including in any management
presentations, information memorandum, supplemental information or other
materials or information with respect to any of the above). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, none of Sellers, their respective Affiliates
or any other Person has made a representation or warranty to Buyer with
respect to (a) any projections, estimates or budgets for the Business or (b)
any material, documents or information relating to Sellers, the Acquired
Assets, the Business or other matters that is not expressly and specifically
included in this Agreement made available to Buyer or its Representatives in
any "data room", offering memorandum or otherwise, except as expressly and
specifically covered by a representation or warranty set forth in Article 4.
Buyer agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that Sellers and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives shall not have any liability or
responsibility whatsoever to Buyer or its Affiliates or any of their

Sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be a part of, or to affect the meaning or interpretation of, this
Agreement.

  



  

9.11 _Exclusive Jurisdiction and Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) Without limiting any Partys right to appeal any order of the Bankruptcy
Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction to
enforce the terms of this Agreement and to decide any claims or disputes
which may arise or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement, any
breach or default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(ii) any and all Proceedings related to the foregoing shall be filed and
maintained only in the

  



        
   

  



  

Bankruptcy Court, and the Parties hereby consent to and submit to the
jurisdiction and venue of the Bankruptcy Court and shall receive Notices at
such locations as indicated in Section 9.5.

  



  

(b) The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by Buyer in
accordance with the specific terms contained herein or were otherwise
breached by Buyer. It is accordingly agreed that Sellers shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or termination of this
Agreement by Buyer and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement. The Parties further agree that Buyer shall not be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or termination of this
Agreement by Sellers or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and that Buyers sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
such breach shall be the remedy available to Buyer set forth in Section
8.2(b).

  



  

9.12 _WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY_. SELLERS AND BUYER HEREBY WAIVE TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT THEY MAY HAVE TO
A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).

  



  

9.13 _Guaranty_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the conditions and limitations as set forth below, Guarantor
hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as principal
and not as surety, to Sellers and their Affiliates and successors thereof,
the due and punctual payment and performance of all obligations of Buyer
under this Agreement (the guaranty obligations under this Section 9.13,
collectively, the " _Guarantied Obligations_ ").

  



  

(b) Guarantor guarantees that the Guarantied Obligations will be duly and
punctually paid and fully and completely performed (in the case of
performance, as if Guarantor were the primary obligor) in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. If for any reason Buyer shall fail or be unable duly
and punctually to pay or fully and completely to perform any
Guarantied Obligation as and when the same shall become due or otherwise
required, then Guarantor shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, forthwith duly and punctually pay or fully and completely perform
such Guarantied Obligation (in the case of performance, as if Guarantor was
the primary obligor). Guarantor further agrees that this Agreement, to the
extent it requires the payment of money, constitutes a guaranty of payment
when due and not of collection and is in no way conditioned or contingent
upon any attempt to collect from Buyer. Guarantors liability under this
Agreement shall be absolute, unconditional, irrevocable and continuing
irrespective, without limitation, of:

  



  

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement as a result of
the application of any bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar
Laws relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity to Buyer;

  



  

(ii) any modification, amendment, consent, extension, forbearance or waiver
of or any consent to departure from this Agreement that may be agreed to by
Buyer;

  



        
   

  



  

(iii) any action or inaction by Sellers under or in respect of this
Agreement, or any failure, lack of diligence, omission or delay on the part
of any Seller to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy
conferred on any Seller in this Agreement;

  



  

(iv) any merger or consolidation of the Parties or any other Person into or
with any Person, or any sale, lease or transfer of any of the assets of the
Parties or any other Person to any other Person;

  



  

(v) any change in the ownership of any of the Parties or any Person; or

  



  

(vi) any other occurrence, circumstance, happening or event, whether similar
or dissimilar to the foregoing and whether foreseen or unforeseen, which
otherwise might constitute a legal or equitable defense or discharge of the
Liabilities of a guarantor or surety or which otherwise might limit recourse
against Guarantor or any other Person;

  



  

 _provided_ , _however_ , that in any event Guarantor shall in all events
have the benefit of any rights (including any defenses) to which Buyer would
be entitled in respect of the Guarantied Obligations.

  



  

(c) Guarantor hereby unconditionally waives (i) any and all notices,
including promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of this Agreement and
any other notice with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations and this
Agreement, (ii) any presentment, demand, performance, protest, notice of
nonpayment as the same pertains to Buyer, suit or the taking of other action
by any Seller against, and any other notice to, Buyer, Guarantor or others
with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations, (iii) any right to require
any Seller to proceed against Buyer or to exhaust any security held by any
Seller or to pursue any other remedy with respect to any of the Guarantied
Obligations, (iv) any defense based upon an election of remedies by Sellers,
unless the same would excuse performance by Buyer under this Agreement with
respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations and (v) any duty of Sellers to
advise Guarantor of any information known to Sellers regarding Buyer or its
ability to perform under this Agreement with respect to any of the Guarantied
Obligations. Each Seller may at any time, and from time to time, without
notice to, or consent of, Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the
obligations of Guarantor hereunder, with respect to any of the Guarantied
Obligations, (1) agree with Buyer to make any change in the terms of the
Guarantied Obligations, (2) take or fail to take any action of any kind in
respect of any security for the Guarantied Obligations, (3) exercise or
refrain from exercising any rights against Buyer or others, or (4)
compromise or subordinate the Guarantied Obligations, including any
security therefor. Any other suretyship defenses are hereby waived by
Guarantor with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this Section 9.13 shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if (i) at any time and to the extent that any
payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise
be returned by the payee thereof upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar event of Buyer or Guarantor, all as though such
payment had not been made, or (ii) the obligations of Guarantor under this
Section 9.13 with respect to any of the Guarantied Obligations are released
in consideration of a payment of money or transfer of property by Buyer or
any other Person and to the extent that such payment, transfer or grant is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the recipient thereof upon the
insolvency,

  



        
   

  



  

bankruptcy, reorganization or similar event of Buyer, Guarantor or such other
Person, all as though such payment, transfer or grant had not been made.

  



  

9.14 _Survival_. Each and every representation and warranty contained in
this Agreement shall expire and be of no further force and effect as of the
Closing. Each and every covenant and agreement contained in this Agreement
(other than the covenants contained in this Agreement which by their terms
are to be performed (in whole or in part) by the Parties following the
Closing) shall expire and be of no further force and effect as of the
Closing.

  



  

9.15 _Computation of Time_. In computing any period of time prescribed by or
allowed with respect to any provision of this Agreement that relates to
Sellers or the Chapter 11 Cases, the provisions of rule 9006(a) of the
Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure shall apply.

  



  

9.16 _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence of this Agreement.

  



  

9.17 _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director, manager, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner or equity holder of any Seller shall
have any Liability for any Liabilities of such Seller under this Agreement or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

  



  

9.18 _Sellers  Representative; Dealings Among Sellers_. By its execution
and delivery of this Agreement, each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes
and appoints Holdings as its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact (the
"Sellers Representative"), with full power of substitution to act in such
Sellers name, place and stead with respect to all transactions contemplated
by and all terms and provisions of this Agreement, and to act on such
Sellers behalf in any Proceeding, and to do or refrain from doing all such
further acts and things, and execute all such documents as the Sellers
Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The appointment of the Sellers
Representative shall be deemed coupled with an interest and shall be
irrevocable, and Buyer, its Affiliates and any other Person may conclusively
and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the Sellers
Representative on behalf of Sellers in all matters referred to herein or
contemplated hereby including any direction regarding the amount of any
payment to any Seller. Buyer shall have no obligation of any
nature whatsoever for determining any allocation of any payments among
Sellers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, absent specific
direction by the Sellers Representative, Buyer shall be deemed to have
fulfilled its obligations hereunder absolutely with respect to any amounts
payable by it under or pursuant to this Agreement or the delivery of any
instruments if Buyer shall pay any such amounts or deliver such instruments
to the Sellers Representative.  All Notices delivered by Buyer (whether
prior to or following the Closing) to the Sellers Representative (whether
pursuant hereto or otherwise) for the benefit of Sellers shall constitute
valid and timely Notice to all of the Sellers.

  



  

9.19 _Mutual Drafting_. This Agreement is the result of the joint efforts of
Buyer and Sellers, and each provision hereof has been subject to the mutual
consultation, negotiation and agreement of the Parties and there is to be no
construction against any Party based on any presumption of that Partys
involvement in the drafting thereof.
