ARTICLE II

MERGER 

SECTION 2.1 _Closing of the Merger_.

 

(a) _Closing Date._ _ _ Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions (other than those conditions that are not legally permitted to be
waived) to closing set forth in _Article VI_ , the closing (the " _Closing_ ")
of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.1_ shall be
held at the offices of Parent at Two Warren Place, 6120 S. Yale Avenue, Suite
700, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74136-4216 on the next Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver (other than those conditions that are not legally
permitted to be waived) of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_
(other than conditions that would normally be satisfied on the Closing Date,
but subject to satisfaction or waiver (other than those conditions that are
not legally permitted to be waived) of those conditions) commencing at 9:00
a.m., local time, or such other place, date and time as may be mutually
agreed upon in writing by the parties hereto. The " _Closing Date_ ," as
referred to herein, shall mean the date on which the Closing actually occurs.

 

(b) _Effective Time._ Concurrently with or as soon as practicable following
the Closing, Parent and RRMS shall cause a certificate of merger effecting
the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, duly executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA, as applicable (the date and time of such
filing (or, if agreed by the parties hereto, such later time and date as may
be expressed therein as the effective date and time of the Merger) being the "
_Effective Time_ "). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into RRMS,
the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and RRMS shall continue as
the surviving limited partnership in the Merger (the " _Surviving Entity_ ").

(c) _Effect of the Merger on Equity Securities._ _ _ Subject in each case to 
_Sections_ _ _ _2.1(e)_ and _2.1(f)_ , at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, RRMS, RRMS
General Partner, any Holder of RRMS Common Units, any Holder of Parent Common
Stock, or any other Person:

(i) _Conversion of RRMS Public Units._ Each of the RRMS Public Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive 0.8136 shares of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable Parent Common Stock (such number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(ii) Each RRMS Public Unit, upon being converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_ , shall cease to be
outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each Holder of such RRMS Public Units immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall thereafter cease to

 



12  be a limited partner of RRMS or have any rights with respect to such RRMS
Public Units, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and any
distributions and Fractional Share Proceeds to which former Holders of RRMS
Public Units become entitled all in accordance with this _Article II_ upon the
Surrender of (A) a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented RRMS Public Units (a " _RRMS Certificate_ ") (or lost certificate
affidavit as contemplated by _Section_ _ _ _2.2(b))_ or (B) uncertificated
RRMS Public Units represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry RRMS Common Units_
"), together with such properly completed and duly executed Letter of
Transmittal and such other documents in accordance with _Section_ _ _ _2.2_.

 

(iii) _Treatment of RRMS-Owned Units and Parent-Owned Partnership Interests._
Any RRMS Common Units that are owned immediately prior to the Effective Time
by RRMS shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such canceled RRMS Common
Units. All (a) RRMS General Partner Interest, (b) RRMS Incentive Distribution
Rights and (c) RRMS Common Units that are not RRMS Public Units or subject to
RRMS Restricted Unit Awards or not cancelled pursuant to the first sentence of
this clause (iii) shall, in each case, remain outstanding as partnership
interests in the Surviving Entity, unaffected by the Merger or, with respect
to RRMS Restricted Unit Awards, be treated as described in _Section 2.3_.

 

(iv) _Equity of Merger Sub_. The outstanding limited liability company
interest in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into an aggregate number of common units of
the Surviving Entity equal to the number of RRMS Public Units that are
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to 
_Section_ _ _ _2.1(c)(i)_. At the Effective Time, the books and records of
RRMS shall be revised to reflect the cancellation and retirement of all RRMS
Public Units and the conversion of the limited liability company interest in
Merger Sub to common units of the Surviving Entity, and the existence of RRMS
(as the Surviving Entity) shall continue without dissolution.

 

(d) _Other Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall be conducted in
accordance with and shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and
the applicable provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA. At the Effective Time, (i) the
certificate of limited partnership of RRMS shall continue as the certificate
of limited partnership of the Surviving Entity, and (ii) the RRMS Partnership
Agreement shall remain unchanged and shall continue as the agreement of
limited partnership of the Surviving Entity, until duly amended in accordance
with applicable Law and the terms of the RRMS Partnership Agreement (subject
to  _Section_ _ _ _5.9_ hereof).

(e) _No Fractional Shares._ _ _ Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, (i) no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger and (ii) each registered
Holder of RRMS Public Units converted pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all RRMS Public Units held by such Holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall be entitled to receive, from
the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ _ _
_2.1(e)_ , a cash payment, without interest, in lieu of

 



13  such fractional shares representing such Holders proportionate interest, in
the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (the " _Share Proceeds_ ") in
one or more transactions of a number of shares of Parent Common Stock, such
number equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock reserved with the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section_
_ _ _2.2(a)_  minus (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that Holders of RRMS Public Units are entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ and _Section_ _ _ _2.1(c)(ii)_ (such excess,
which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be equal to the aggregate number of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that the registered Holders of RRMS
Public Units converted pursuant to the Merger would have otherwise been
entitled to receive, the " _Excess Shares_ "). The parties acknowledge that
payment of the cash Share Proceeds in lieu of issuing certificates or scrip
for fractional shares was not separately bargained-for consideration but
merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the
expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the
issuance of fractional shares. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of RRMS Public Units that
would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, shall sell
the Excess Shares at then-prevailing price on the NYSE in the manner provided
in this _Section 2.1(e)_ and such sales shall be executed in round lots to
the extent practicable. Until the Share Proceeds of such sale or sales have
been distributed to the Holders of such RRMS Public Units, the Exchange Agent
shall hold such Share Proceeds in trust for the benefit of the Holders of such
RRMS Public Units (the " _Fractional Share Proceeds_ "). The Exchange Agent
shall determine the portion of the Fractional Share Proceeds to which each
Holder of such RRMS Public Units shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the
amount of the aggregate Share Proceeds comprising the Fractional Share
Proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional
share interest to which such Holder of such RRMS Public Units would otherwise
be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of such RRMS Public Units
would otherwise be entitled.

 

(f) _Certain Adjustments._ _ _ If between the Execution Date and the Effective
Time, whether or not permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
number of outstanding RRMS Common Units or shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be changed into a different number of units, shares or other securities
(including any different class or series of securities) by reason of any
dividend or distribution payable in partnership interests, voting securities,
equity interests or Rights, subdivision, reclassification, split, split-up,
combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization, exchange or other similar
transaction, or any such transaction shall be authorized, declared or agreed
upon with a record date at or prior to the Effective Time, then the Merger
Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such transaction and to provide to
RRMS, Merger Sub and the Holders of RRMS Restricted Unit Awards and RRMS
Public Units the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event, and thereafter, all references in this Agreement to the Merger
Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items shall be references to
the Merger Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items, as so
adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this  _Section_ _ _
_2.1(f)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any
such dividend or distribution payable in partnership interests, shares, voting
securities, equity interests or Rights, subdivision, reclassification, split,
split-up, combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization, exchange or
other similar transaction, or the authorization, declaration or agreement to
do such transaction that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to be
undertaken pursuant to this Agreement.

 



14 SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of RRMS Public Units_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent._ _ _ Prior to the mailing of the Consent
Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement, Parent shall
appoint Computershare (or a different exchange agent reasonably acceptable to
Parent and RRMS) to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration and any dividends and other distributions
pursuant to  _Section 2.2(c)_ and any Fractional Share Proceeds. Promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) reserve with the Exchange Agent the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to _Section_ _ _
_2.1(c)(i)_  and (ii) authorize the Exchange Agent to exchange shares of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with this _Section 2.2_. Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent any additional cash or other consideration as
and when necessary to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c)_ and other amounts required to be paid under this Agreement.
Parent shall pay all costs and fees of the Exchange Agent and all expenses
associated with the exchange process. Any shares of Parent Common Stock, or
fraction thereof, any remaining Fractional Share Proceeds, and any remaining
amount of funds deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be returned to Parent
after the earlier to occur of (x) payment in full of all amounts due to the
Holders of RRMS Public Units and (y) twelve months after the Closing Date, and
any Holders of the RRMS Certificates or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units who have
not theretofore complied with this  _Section 2.2_ shall thereafter look only
to Parent and only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for
the Merger Consideration, any Share Proceeds and any distributions or other
distributions to which such Holders may be entitled.

(b) _Exchange Procedures._ _ _ Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail to each Holder, as of the
Effective Time, of RRMS Public Units whose RRMS Public Units were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration a form of letter of
transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the RRMS
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the RRMS Certificates
(or lost certificate affidavit as contemplated by this  _Section_ _ _
_2.2(b)_ ) to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry RRMS Common
Units, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal, and which shall be in such customary form and have such
other provisions as Parent and RRMS may reasonably agree prior to the
Effective Time and instructions for effecting the Surrender of such RRMS
Certificates (or lost certificate affidavit as contemplated by this _Section_
_ _ _2.2(b)_ ) or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units in exchange for, as
applicable, whole shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.2(c)_ and any Fractional
Share Proceeds. Subject to  _Section_ _ _ _2.2(c)_ , upon Surrender to the
Exchange Agent of such RRMS Certificates (or lost certificate affidavit as
contemplated by this _Section_ _ _ _2.2(b)_ ) or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units,
together with such properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the Holder of a RRMS Certificate (or lost certificate affidavit as
contemplated by this  _Section_ _ _ _2.2(b)_ ) or Book-Entry RRMS Common
Units shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i)
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) to
which such Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.1(c)(i)_ , (ii) the
Fractional Share Proceeds, if any, payable in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable and (iii) any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.2(c)_ to which such Holder
is entitled. The

 



15  instructions for effecting the Surrender of RRMS Certificates shall set
forth procedures that must be taken by the Holder of any RRMS Certificate that
has been lost, destroyed or stolen; it shall be a condition to the right of
such Holder to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Proceeds, if any, and any distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ _ _
_2.2(c)_ that the Exchange Agent shall have received, along with the Letter
of Transmittal, a duly executed lost certificate affidavit, including an
agreement to indemnify Parent, signed exactly as the name or names of the
registered Holder or Holders of RRMS Public Units appeared on the books of
RRMS immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with a customary bond
and such other documents, in each case, as Parent may reasonably require in
connection therewith. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
transfer on the records of RRMS or its transfer agent of RRMS Certificates or
Book-Entry RRMS Common Units ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
shall not restrict the transfer of any RRMS Partnership Interest other than
the RRMS Public Units after the Effective Time); and if such RRMS
Certificates or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units are presented to RRMS or its
transfer agent for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of the
appropriate Merger Consideration, any Fractional Share Proceeds and any
distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.2(c)_ as hereinabove
provided. Until Surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ _ _ _2.2(b)_ ,
each RRMS Certificate or Book-Entry RRMS Common Unit shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
Surrender the appropriate Merger Consideration, together with any
distributions payable pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _2.2(c)_ and Fractional
Share Proceeds as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_. No interest will be paid
or will accrue on any Fractional Share Proceeds or any distributions payable
pursuant to  _Section_ _ _ _2.2(c)_.

of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the Holder of any RRMS Certificate or Book-
Entry RRMS Common Units not Surrendered with respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable in respect thereof until the Surrender of such RRMS
Certificate or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units in accordance with this _Section
2.2_. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, Parent shall pay, or cause
the Exchange Agent to pay, to the Holder of each RRMS Certificate or Book-
Entry RRMS Common Units, without interest, (i) at the time of Surrender of

however, to Parents obligation,

 



16  with respect to RRMS Public Units outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, to pay any distributions with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that may have been declared or made by RRMS on such RRMS

Consideration, distribution or Fractional Share Proceeds properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any RRMS Certificates or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units shall
not have been Surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any Merger
Consideration, any Fractional Share Proceeds or any distributions with
respect to RRMS Common Units or shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of
such RRMS Certificate or Book-Entry RRMS Common Units would escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such units, cash or

Units shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously

the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with
the relevant Governmental Entity by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(g) _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 2.3 _Treatment of RRMS Restricted Unit Awards and RRMS UDRs._

(a) At the Effective Time, each RRMS Restricted Unit Award that is not vested
and does not vest in accordance with its terms (as set forth in an applicable
award agreement) as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall cease to represent an award with respect to RRMS Common Units and
shall be converted into an award with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
(a " _Parent Award_ "), subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions
as were applicable to such RRMS Restricted Unit Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time, with the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject
to each such Parent Award to be equal to the number of RRMS Common Units
subject to each such RRMS Restricted Unit Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration (rounded down to the
nearest whole share), with any corresponding accrued but unpaid UDRs (as
defined in the RRMS Equity Incentive Plan) with respect to any RRMS Restricted
Unit Awards to be assumed by Parent, remain outstanding and continue to
represent an obligation with respect to the applicable Parent Award.

 



17 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, RRMS and RRMS General Partner shall take all
action necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.3_. RRMS and
RRMS General Partner shall ensure that, as of immediately following the
Effective Time, no holder of a RRMS Restricted Unit Award or participant in
the RRMS Equity Incentive Plan shall have any rights thereunder to acquire,
or other rights in respect of, the equity of RRMS, the Surviving Entity or any
of the RRMS Subsidiaries.

 

(c) Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will
be subject to the Parent Awards as a result of the actions contemplated by
this _Section 2.3_. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, to the extent legally required, file a registration statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not available, other
appropriate forms, including Form S-3) with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to such Parent Awards and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of any such registration statement or
registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Parent Awards remain
outstanding and the offering with respect thereto is required to be
registered.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE RRMS PARTIES

 

Except (i) as set forth in a section of the RRMS Disclosure Letter
corresponding to the applicable section of this _Article III_ to which such
disclosure applies ( _provided_ that any information set forth in one section
of the RRMS Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to each other section
thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face) or (ii) as
disclosed in the RRMS SEC Reports (excluding any disclosures set forth in such
RRMS SEC Report under the heading "Risk Factors" or in any section related to
forward-looking statements (other than any factual information contained

2015 and prior to the Execution Date (without giving effect to any SEC Report
or any amendment to any SEC Report in each case filed on or after the
Execution Date), RRMS and, with respect to itself where provided for in this
_Article_ _ _ _III_ , the RRMS General Partner each hereby represent and
warrant to the Parent Parties that:

 

SECTION 3.1 _Organization and Existence_ _._

 

(a) Each of the RRMS Parties is a limited partnership or limited liability
company duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the State of Delaware and has all requisite limited partnership or limited
liability company power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

 

(b) Each of the RRMS Subsidiaries (other than any of the RRMS Parties) is an
entity duly organized or formed, as applicable, validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the
Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization or formation and has all
requisite power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

 



18 (c) Each of the RRMS Group Entities is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing in the states in which the character of the
properties and assets owned or held by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it requires it to be so licensed or qualified, except where the
failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a RRMS Material Adverse Effect.

(d) RRMS has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
Governing Documents of each RRMS Party in effect as of the Execution Date. All
such Governing Documents are in full force and effect and no RRMS Party is in
violation of any provisions thereof.

 

SECTION 3.2 _Authority and Approval_. Each of the RRMS Parties has all
requisite limited liability company or limited partnership power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to perform all of the terms and
conditions hereof to be performed by it, subject to receipt of the RRMS Vote,
in the case of RRMS. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
the RRMS Parties, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
the performance of all of the terms and conditions hereof to be performed by
the RRMS Parties have been duly authorized and approved by all requisite
limited partnership or limited liability company action on the part of each of
the RRMS Parties, subject to receipt of the RRMS Vote, in the case of RRMS. At
a meeting duly called and held, the RRMS Conflicts Committee, by unanimous
vote, in good faith (a) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are in the best interest of RRMS considering the interests
of the RRMS Unaffiliated Holders, (b) approved this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the foregoing

including the Merger, and (b) directed that this Agreement be submitted to a
vote of Holders of RRMS Common Units and authorized the Holders of RRMS Common
Units to act by written consent pursuant to Section 13.11 of the RRMS
Partnership Agreement. Following such approval by the RRMS Conflicts Committee
and the RRMS Board, RRMS Holdings approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger. The adoption of this Agreement by
the affirmative vote or consent of the Holders of at least a Unit Majority (as
defined in the RRMS Partnership Agreement) (the " _RRMS Vote_ ") is the only
vote or approval of the holders of any partnership interests in RRMS
necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and approve and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of the RRMS Parties
and constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of each of the RRMS
Parties, enforceable against each of the RRMS Parties in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other

at law or in equity).

note, agreement, contract, commitment, license, concession, permit lease,
joint venture, obligation or other instrument, except in the case of _clauses
(ii)_ , _(iii)_ and _(iv)_ , for those items that would not, individually or

debentures, notes or other indebtedness, the holders of which have the right
to vote (or which are convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the limited partners of RRMS on any
matter.

(b) Section 3.4(b) of the RRMS Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of the RRMS Subsidiaries as of the Execution Date. As of the
Execution Date, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity

by Sections 17-303, 17-403, 17-607 and 17-804 of the DRULPA and the Governing

SECTION 3.5 _SEC Documents; Internal Controls_ _._

 

(a) Since January 1, 2015, all reports, including but not limited to the
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the
Current Reports on Form 8-K (whether filed on a voluntary basis or otherwise),
forms, schedules, certifications, prospectuses, registration statements and
other documents required to be filed or furnished by RRMS or any RRMS
Subsidiary with or to the SEC have been or will be timely filed or furnished
(the " _RRMS SEC Reports_ "). Each of the RRMS SEC Reports (i) complied in all
material respects with the requirements of applicable Law (including the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ")), and (ii) as of its effective date (in the case of
RRMS SEC Reports that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and as of its filing date did not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except for any statements (x) in any RRMS SEC Report that may have
been modified by an amendment to such report or a subsequent report filed
with the SEC prior to the Execution Date or (y) with respect to information
supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent, as to which RRMS makes no
representation or warranty.

 

(b) No RRMS Subsidiary is required to file reports, forms or other documents
with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding comments
from, or unresolved issues raised by, the staff of the SEC with respect to the
RRMS SEC Reports. No enforcement action has been initiated against RRMS
relating to disclosures contained or omitted from any RRMS SEC Report. 

(c) RRMS makes and keeps books, records, and accounts and has devised and
maintains a system of internal controls, in each case, as required pursuant
to Section 13(b)(2) under the Exchange Act. RRMS has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively,
of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act and the applicable listing standards of the NYSE. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by RRMS in the reports that it files
under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such material information is accumulated and communicated to its management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. RRMS
General Partners principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to RRMSs
auditors and the audit committee of the RRMS Board (x) all significant
deficiencies in the designation or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect RRMSs ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for RRMSs auditors any material weakness
in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in RRMSs
internal controls.

 



22 (d) Since January 1, 2015, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the RRMS General Partner have made all certifications
(without qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to
Knowledge) required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in
any such certifications are complete and correct, and none of such entities
or its officers have received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning
or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or
submission of such certification. As of the Execution Date, and except as
disclosed in a RRMS SEC Report filed with the SEC prior to the Execution Date,
none of such entities has any Knowledge of any material weaknesses in the
design or operation of such internal controls over financial reporting.

 

SECTION 3.6 _Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_ _._

 

(a) RRMSs Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016
(the " _RRMS 10-K_ ") sets forth a true and complete copy of the consolidated
audited statements of income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 and consolidated balance
sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 for RRMS, including the notes
thereto, and RRMSs Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 6,
2016 (the " _RRMS 10-Q_ ") sets forth a true and complete copy of the
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flows for each
of the three month periods ending March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015 and
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 for RRMS,
including the notes thereto (the referenced financial statements set forth in
the RRMS 10-K and in the RRMS 10-Q are collectively referred to as the "
_RRMS Financial Statements_ "). The RRMS Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods covered thereby (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
RRMS as of such dates and the consolidated statements of income and cash flows
of RRMS for such periods, except as otherwise noted therein. Except as set
forth in the RRMS Financial Statements, there are no off-balance sheet
arrangements that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a RRMS
Material Adverse Effect. RRMS has not had any disagreement with
its independent public accounting firm that required disclosure in the RRMS
SEC Reports.

(b) There are no liabilities or obligations of RRMS, RRMS General Partner or
the RRMS Subsidiaries (whether known or unknown and whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) and there are no facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in any such liabilities or obligations,
whether arising in the context of federal, state or local judicial,
regulatory, administrative or permitting agency Proceedings, other than (i)
liabilities or obligations disclosed, reflected or reserved against in the
RRMS Financial Statements, (ii) current liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business since December 31, 2015, (iii) liabilities and obligations
incurred under or in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) liabilities or
obligations (whether known or unknown and whether accrued, absolute,

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARENT PARTIES

 

Except (i) as set forth in a section of the Parent Disclosure Letter

disclosure applies ( _provided_ that any information set forth in one section
of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to each other section
thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face) or (ii) as
disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports (excluding any disclosures set forth in
such Parent SEC Report under the heading "Risk Factors" or in any section
related to forward-looking statements (other than any factual
information contained within such headings, disclosure or statements)) filed
on or after January 1, 2015 and prior to the Execution Date (without giving
effect to any SEC Report or any amendment to any SEC Report in each case filed
on or after the Execution Date), Parent hereby represents and warrants to the
RRMS Parties that:

SECTION 4.1 _Organization and Existence_ _._

 

(a) Each of the Parent Parties is a corporation or limited liability company
duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate or limited liability company
power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted.

 

(b) Each of the Parent Subsidiaries (other than Merger Sub) is an entity duly
organized or formed, as applicable, validly existing and in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of
its respective jurisdiction of organization or formation and has all requisite
power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as now conducted.

(c) Each of the Parent Group Entities is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing in the states in which the character of the
properties and assets owned or held by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it requires it to be so licensed or qualified, except where the
failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(d) Parent has made available to RRMS true and complete copies of the
Governing Documents of each Parent Party in effect as of the Execution Date.
All such Governing Documents are in full force and effect and no Parent Party
is in violation of any provisions thereof.

 



29 (e) All of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of
Merger Sub are owned, beneficially and of record, by Rose Rock Midstream
Holdings, LLC. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Sub

SECTION 4.2 _Authority and Approval._ Each of the Parent Parties has all
requisite corporate or limited liability company power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to consummate the transactions

the case of Parent. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of
the Parent Parties, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby

approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Parent Stock Issuance, and
(c) resolved to submit the Parent Stock Issuance to a vote of Parents

affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the
aggregate voting power present at the Parent Stockholder Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof to approve the Parent Stock Issuance (the
" _Parent Stock Issuance Approval_ _"_ ) is the only vote or approval of the
holders of any class or series of the capital stock of Parent necessary to
approve the Parent Stock Issuance and approve and consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by each of the Parent Parties and constitutes the
valid and legally binding obligation of each of the Parent Parties,
enforceable against each of the Parent Parties in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other similar
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights and remedies generally
and by general principles of equity (whether applied in a Proceeding at law or
in equity). As of the Execution Date, RRMS Holdings is the record holder and

of the RRMS Common Units outstanding on the date hereof.

which any of the Parent Group Entities is a party or by which any of the
Parent Group Entities or any of their assets are bound; or (iv) result in the
creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any of the assets or

or as expressly contemplated by this Agreement. There are no outstanding
obligations of Parent or any Parent Group Entity to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any capital stock, voting securities or other equity

outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness, the holders of
which have the right

matter. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(b) Section 4.4(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of the Parent Subsidiaries as of the Execution Date. As of the
Execution Date, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock, voting
securities or other equity interests of each Parent Subsidiary owned directly

of the applicable Parent Subsidiary) and nonassessable (with respect to
Parent Subsidiaries that are limited liability companies or limited

beneficially, directly or indirectly, any equity securities or other ownership
interests of any Person as of the Execution Date. There are no outstanding
Rights issued or granted by, or binding upon, any of the Parent Subsidiaries
as of the Execution Date.

 

SECTION 4.5 _SEC Documents; Internal Controls._

 

(a) Since January 1, 2015, all reports, including but not limited to the
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the
Current Reports on Form 8-K (whether filed on a voluntary basis or otherwise),
forms, schedules, certifications, prospectuses, registration statements and
other documents required to be filed or furnished by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary with or to the SEC have been or will be timely filed or furnished
(the " _Parent SEC Reports_ "). Each of the Parent SEC Reports (i) complied in
all material respects with the requirements of applicable Law (including the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and (ii) as of
its effective date (in the case of Parent SEC Reports that are registration
statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of
its filing date did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except for any statements (x) in any
Parent SEC Report that may have been modified by an amendment to such report
or a subsequent report filed with the SEC prior to the Execution Date or (y)
with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of RRMS, as
to which Parent makes no representation or warranty.

(b) No Parent Subsidiary is required to file reports, forms or other
documents with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding
comments from, or unresolved issues raised by, the staff of the SEC with
respect to the Parent SEC Reports. No enforcement action has been initiated
against Parent relating to disclosures contained or omitted from any Parent
SEC Report.

 



32 (c) Parent makes and keeps books, records, and accounts and has devised and
maintains a system of internal controls, in each case, as required pursuant
to Section 13(b)(2) under the Exchange Act. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act and the applicable listing standards of the
NYSE. Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed
to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by Parent in
the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and
communicated to its management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board
(x) all significant deficiencies in the designation or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents auditors
any material weakness in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls.

(d) Since January 1, 2015, the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of Parent have made all certifications (without
qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to Knowledge)
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct, and none of such entities or its
officers have received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission
of such certification. As of the Execution Date, and except as disclosed in a
Parent SEC Report filed with the SEC prior to the Execution Date, none of such
entities has any Knowledge of any material weaknesses in the design or
operation of such internal controls over financial reporting. 

SECTION 4.6 _Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_ _._

 

(a) Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26,
2016 (the " _Parent 10-K_ ") sets forth a true and complete copy of the
consolidated audited statements of operations and comprehensive income,
changes in owners equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2015 and balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and
2014 for Parent, including the notes thereto, and Parents Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 6, 2016 (the " _Parent 10-Q_ ") sets forth
a true and complete copy of the unaudited condensed consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows for each of the
three month periods ending March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015 and unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 for Parent,
including the notes thereto (the referenced financial statements set forth in
the Parent 10-K and in the Parent 10-Q are collectively referred to as the "
_Parent Financial Statements_ "). The Parent Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods covered thereby (except as may be indicated

 



33  in the notes thereto) and present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent as of such dates and the
consolidated results of operations and comprehensive income and cash flows of
Parent for such periods, except as otherwise noted therein. Except as set
forth in the Parent Financial Statements, there are no off-balance sheet
arrangements that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has not had any disagreement with its
independent public accounting firm that required disclosure in the Parent SEC
Reports.

 

(b) There are no liabilities or obligations of Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries (whether known or unknown and whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) and there are no facts or circumstances
that would reasonably be expected to result in any such liabilities or
obligations, whether arising in the context of federal, state or local
judicial, regulatory, administrative or permitting agency Proceedings, other
than (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed, reflected or reserved against
in the Parent Financial Statements, (ii) current liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business since December 31, 2015, (iii) liabilities and
obligations incurred under or in accordance with this Agreement or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv)
liabilities or obligations (whether known or unknown and whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Rights-of-Way the absence of which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Parent Group
Entities has fulfilled and performed all its material obligations with respect
to such Rights-of-Way and no event has occurred that allows, or after notice
or lapse of time would allow, revocation or termination thereof or would
result in any impairment of the rights of the holder of any such Rights-of-
Way, except for such revocations, terminations and impairments that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(c) (i) (A) there are no pending Proceedings to modify the zoning
classification of, or to condemn or take by power of eminent domain, all or
any of the assets of the Parent Group Entities and (B) none of the Parent
Parties have Knowledge of any such threatened Proceeding, which (in the case
of clause (A) or (B)), if pursued, would, individually or in the aggregate,

jurisdictions subject to zoning, the assets of the Parent Group Entities that
are real property 

 



34  (owned or leased) are properly zoned for the existence, occupancy and use of
all of the improvements located on the owned and leased real property and on
the Rights-of-Way held by any of the Parent Group Entities, except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
and (iii) none of such improvements are subject to any conditional use permits
or "permitted non-conforming use" or "permitted non-conforming structure"
classifications or similar permits or classifications, except as would not,
either currently or in the case of a rebuilding of or additional construction
of improvements, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

that such access shall be provided on a basis that minimizes the disruption to
the operations of the disclosing Party Group and the members of its Party
Group. The disclosing Party Group shall not be responsible to the requesting
Party Group for personal injuries sustained by the requesting Party Groups
Representatives in connection with the access provided pursuant to this
_Section 5.2_ , and shall be indemnified and held harmless by the requesting
Party Group for any losses suffered by the disclosing Party Group or its
Representatives in connection with any such personal injuries. Subject to
applicable Laws, during such period, each Party Group shall (and shall cause

thereunder), as applicable (other than documents which such Party Group is not
permitted to disclose under applicable Laws) and (ii) all information
concerning the disclosing Party Groups business, properties and personnel as
the requesting Party Group may reasonably request, including all information
relating to environmental matters. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party
Group shall have no obligation to disclose or provide access to any

jeopardize any privilege available to such Party Group relating to such
information or would be in violation of a confidentiality obligation binding
on such Party Group. Each party shall hold information received from the
other party pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ in confidence in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April 19, 2016 between

use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE (subject, if
applicable, to notice of issuance) prior to the Effective Time, and (iii)
the parties hereto shall make all required filings under applicable state
securities and "blue sky" Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such filings
shall be required in any jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, Parent
would become subject to general service of process or to taxation or
qualification to do business as a foreign corporation doing business in such
jurisdiction solely as a result of such filing. Parent agrees to file the
Registration Statement with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable.
Each of Parent and RRMS agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after filing thereof and keep the Registration
Statement effective until the earlier of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the stockholders of Parent as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and
RRMS agrees to furnish to the other party all information concerning the
Parent Group Entities or the RRMS

 



43  Group Entities, as applicable, and to take such other action as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement or the Consent
Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or RRMS, in
each case without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment thereon.

 

(b) Each of the Parent Parties and the RRMS Parties agrees, as to itself and
its Subsidiaries, that (i) none of the information supplied or to be supplied
by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or
supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and (ii) none of the information supplied or to be supplied by
it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Consent
Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement
thereto will, at the date the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy
Statement is mailed to the Holders of RRMS Common Units or Parent Common
Stock, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of
the Parent Parties and the RRMS Parties further agrees that, if it shall
become aware prior to the Closing Date of any information that would cause any
of the statements in the Registration Statement or the Consent
Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not false or misleading, it will promptly inform the other party
thereof and take the necessary steps to correct such information in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Consent
Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement.

 

(c) Each of RRMS and Parent shall (1) promptly notify the other of receipt of
any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other applicable government
official and of any requests by the SEC or its staff or any other applicable
government official for amendments or supplements to any of the filings with
the SEC in connection with the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby or for additional information and (2) promptly supply the other with
copies of all correspondence between RRMS or any of its Representatives, or
Parent or any of its Representatives, as the case may be, on the one hand, and
the SEC or its staff or any other applicable government official, on the
other hand, with respect thereto. Parent and RRMS shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement
or the Registration Statement as promptly as practicable.

(d) RRMS General Partner shall distribute to the Holders of RRMS Common Units
the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement, which shall include a
form of consent that may be executed by Holders of RRMS Common Units in
connection with the Written Consent as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act.

(e) Parent shall, as soon as practicable following the effective date of the
Registration Statement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a

 



44  special meeting of its stockholders (the " _Parent Stockholder Meeting_ ")
for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stock Issuance Approval. Subject to 
_Section_ _ _ _5.3(f)_ , Parent shall, through the Parent Board, recommend to
its stockholders approval of the Parent Stock Issuance (the " _Parent Board
Recommendation_ ") and shall not (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose
publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to RRMS, such
recommendation or (ii) fail to include such Parent Board Recommendation in the
Parent Proxy Statement (any such action being referred to herein as a "
_Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Subject to _Section_ _ _ _5.3(f)_ ,
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the
Parent Stock Issuance Approval. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the obligations of Parent set forth in the first sentence of this
_Section_ _ _ _5.3(e)_ shall not be affected by a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change (other than a Parent Recommendation Change made in
connection with a Parent Designated Proposal). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Parent may postpone or adjourn the Parent
Stockholder Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Parent Stock Issuance Approval, (ii) in the absence of a
quorum, (iii) if Parent has delivered any notice contemplated by _Section_ _ _
_5.3(f)_ and the time periods contemplated by  _Section_ _ _ _5.3(f)_ have
not expired, or (iv) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that Parent has determined
after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable
Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by the stockholders of Parent prior to the Parent Stockholder
Meeting.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Parent Stock Issuance Approval, and subject to
compliance with the provisions of this _Section_ _ _ _5.3(f)_ , the Parent
Board may, if the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with the Parents financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that
the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law, make a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided, however_ , that no such Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made in response to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal that does not constitute a Parent Designated Proposal;
_provided further_ , _however_ , that the Parent Board may not effect a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing unless:

(i) Parent has provided prior written notice to RRMS of its intention to make
a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, specifying in reasonable detail the
reasons for such action (including, in the case of a Parent Designated
Proposal, a description of the material terms of such Parent Designated
Proposal and a copy of any draft definitive agreement reflecting such Parent
Designated Proposal), at least five (5) days in advance of its making a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, unless at the time such notice is required to
be given there are less than five (5) days prior to the Parent Stockholder
Meeting, in which case Parent shall provide as much notice as is reasonably
practicable (the period inclusive of all such days, the " _Parent Notice
Period_ "); and

 

(ii) during the Parent Notice Period the Parent Board has negotiated, and has
caused its Representatives to negotiate, with RRMS (to the extent RRMS
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that the failure to effect such Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change would not be 

 



45  reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Parent Boards fiduciary
duties to stockholders under applicable Law; provided that any material
amendment to the terms of a Parent Designated Proposal, if applicable, shall
require a new notice pursuant to this _Section 5.3(f)_ and a new Parent Notice
Period, except that such new Parent Notice Period in connection with any
material amendment shall be for three (3) days from the time RRMS receives
such notice (as opposed to five (5) days).

SECTION 5.4 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_. From and
after the Execution Date, upon the terms and subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken,
all appropriate action, and to do or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable and
(ii) defend any lawsuits or other Proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or seek to have lifted or
rescinded any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely
affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing but
subject to the other terms of this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that,
from time to time, whether before, at or after the Closing Date, each of them
will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such
instruments of assignment, transfer, conveyance, endorsement, direction or
authorization as may be necessary to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement will require any party hereto to hold separate or
make any divestiture not expressly contemplated herein of any asset or
otherwise agree to any restriction on its operations or other condition in
order to obtain any consent or approval or other clearance required by this
Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.5 _No Public Announcement_. On the Execution Date, Parent and RRMS
shall issue a joint press release with respect to the execution of this
Agreement and the Merger, which press release shall be reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, RRMS General Partner and the RRMS Conflicts Committee. From and
after the Execution Date, neither RRMS nor Parent shall issue any other press
release or make any other public announcement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (to the extent not previously
issued or made in accordance with this Agreement) (other than public
announcements at industry road shows and conferences or as may be required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with the
NYSE, in which event the party making the public announcement or press release
shall, to the extent practicable, notify Parent and RRMS General Partner in
advance of such public announcement or press release) without the prior
approval of Parent and RRMS General Partner, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 

SECTION 5.6 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, and except
as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses

Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement and (b) the costs of printing and
mailing of the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement.

 



46 SECTION 5.7 _Regulatory Issues_. RRMS and Parent shall cooperate fully
with respect to any filing, submission or communication with a Governmental
Entity having jurisdiction over the Merger. Such cooperation shall include
each of the parties hereto: (i) providing, in the case of oral communications
with a Governmental Entity, advance notice of any such communication and, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, an opportunity for the other party to
participate; (ii) providing, in the case of written communications, an
opportunity for the other party to comment on any such communication and
provide the other with a final copy of all such communications; and (iii)
complying promptly with any request for information from a Governmental Entity
(including an additional request for information and documentary material),
unless directed not to do so by the other party hereto. All cooperation shall
be conducted in such a manner so as to preserve all applicable privileges.

 

SECTION 5.8 _Tax Matters_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for
purposes of any applicable state, local or foreign Tax that follows the U.S.
federal income tax treatment), the parties agree to treat the Merger (a) with
respect to holders of RRMS Public Units, as a taxable sale of such RRMS Common
Units to Parent and (b) with respect to Parent, as a purchase of RRMS Public
Units from the Holders of such RRMS Common Units. The parties will prepare and
file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing and will not take any
inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during the course of any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law following a final determination by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other administrative settlement with or final
administrative decision by the relevant Governmental Entity.

SECTION 5.9 _D andO Insurance_ _._

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the RRMS Group Entities to, honor all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, elimination of liability and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) now existing in
favor of the RRMS DandO Indemnified Parties as provided in the Governing
Documents of any RRMS Group Entity, under applicable Delaware Law or
otherwise, and shall ensure that the Governing Documents of RRMS and RRMS
General Partner (or their successor entities) shall, for a period of six
years following the Effective Time, contain provisions no less advantageous
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses, elimination of
liability and exculpation of their present and former directors, officers,
employees and agents than are set forth in the Governing Documents of RRMS and
RRMS General Partner as of the Execution Date.

 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain
officers and directors liability insurance with a nationally reputable
carrier covering each RRMS DandO Indemnified Party who is or at any time prior
to the Effective Time was covered by the existing officers and directors
liability insurance applicable to the RRMS Group Entities (" _D andO
Insurance_"), on terms no less advantageous to the RRMS DandO Indemnified
Parties, as applicable, than such existing insurance with respect to acts or
omissions, or alleged acts or 

 



47  omissions, prior to the Effective Time (whether claims, actions or other
Proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted or claimed before or
after the Effective Time); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance for the RRMS DandO
Indemnified Parties in excess of 300% of the current annual premium currently
paid by the RRMS Group Entities for such insurance, but shall purchase as
much of such coverage as possible for such applicable amount. Parent shall
have the right to cause such coverage to be extended under the applicable DandO
Insurance by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no
less advantageous to the RRMS DandO Indemnified Parties than the existing DandO
Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this
_Section_ _ _ _5.9_.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement for a period
of six years and expressly are intended to benefit each of the RRMS DandO
Indemnified Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any claim
or claims for indemnification or advancement set forth in this  _Section_ _ _
_5.9_ are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification and advancement in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until disposition of all such claims. The rights of any RRMS DandO
Indemnified Party under this _Section_ _ _ _5.9_ shall be in addition to any
other rights such RRMS DandO Indemnified Party may have under the Governing
Documents of any RRMS Group Entity or applicable Law.

 

(d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in
either such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that its
successors and assigns, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ _ _ _5.9_.

SECTION 5.10  _Dividends and Distributions_. After the Execution Date until
the Effective Time, each of Parent and RRMS shall coordinate with the other
regarding the declaration of any dividends or distributions in respect of
Parent Common Stock and RRMS Common Units and the record dates and payment
dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties that Holders of
RRMS Common Units shall not receive, for any quarter, distributions both in
respect of RRMS Common Units and also dividends in respect of the Parent
Common Stock that they receive in exchange therefor in the Merger, but that
they shall receive for any such quarter (exclusive of any dividends received
in respect of Parent Common Stock not received by such Holders in the Merger)
either: (a) only distributions in respect of RRMS Common Units or (b) only
dividends in respect of Parent Common Stock that they receive in exchange
therefor in the Merger.

 

SECTION 5.11 _Consent to Use of Financial Statements; Financing Cooperation_.
The RRMS Parties hereby consent to the Parent Group Entities use of and

by the Parent Parties to be used in any financing or other activities of the
Parent Parties permitted hereby, including any filings that the Parent Parties
desire to make with the SEC. In addition, the RRMS Parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts, at the Parent Parties sole cost
and expense, to obtain the consents of BDO USA, LLP to

 



48  the inclusion of the financial statements referenced above in appropriate
filings with the SEC. Prior to the Closing, the RRMS Parties will provide the
Parent Parties such information, and make available such personnel, as the
Parent Parties may reasonably request in order to assist any of the Parent
Group Entities in connection with financing activities permitted hereby,
including any public offerings to be registered under the Securities Act or
private offerings.

SECTION 5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the RRMS Board
and the Parent Board shall take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispositions of RRMS Common Units (including derivative
securities with respect to such RRMS Common Units) or acquisitions of shares
of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such
shares Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to RRMS, or
will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

SECTION 5.13 _Conflicts Committee_. Prior to the Effective Time, neither any
Parent Party nor any RRMS Group Entity shall, without the consent of the RRMS
Conflicts Committee, eliminate the RRMS Conflicts Committee, or revoke or
diminish the authority of the RRMS Conflicts Committee, or remove or cause the
removal of any director of the RRMS Board that is a member of the RRMS
Conflicts Committee either as a member of such board or such committee without
the affirmative vote of the members of the RRMS Board, including the

avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.13_ shall not apply to the filling in

of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed
that actions or inactions by RRMS and the RRMS General Partner and their
respective Subsidiaries (other than actions or inactions by the
RRMS Conflicts Committee) shall not be, and not be deemed to be, breaches or
violations or failures to perform by RRMS, the RRMS General Partner or their
respective Subsidiaries of any of the provisions of this Agreement if such
action or inaction was or was not taken, as applicable, at the direction of
or on the recommendation of Parent or any Parent Group Entity acting in its
capacity as such.

SECTION 7.8 _Enforcement of this Agreement_. The parties hereto acknowledge

threatened breach of this Agreement by one of the parties, the parties will
also be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security,
to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance,

deemed to be a waiver by or release of any party of any right or remedy that

SECTION 8.2 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, the provisions of this Agreement
shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. Each
of the parties hereto agrees that this Agreement involves at least $100,000
and that this Agreement has been entered into in express reliance upon 6 Del.
C. § 2708\. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
confirms and agrees that it is and shall continue to be (a) subject to
the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the federal
courts sitting in the State of Delaware, and (b) subject to service of process
in the State of Delaware. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (i) consents and submits to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, solely if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over any matter,
any federal or state court located in the State of Delaware) (the " _Delaware
Courts_ ") for any actions,

 



56  suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (and agrees not to commence any
litigation relating thereto except in such courts), (ii) waives any objection
to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and
agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation
brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum, (c) acknowledges
and agrees that any controversy that may arise under this Agreement is likely
to involve complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each such party
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right such party may have
to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (d) agrees to service of process upon such party in any such
action or proceeding shall be effective if such process is given as a notice
in accordance with _Section 8.1_ or in any manner prescribed by the Laws of
the State of Delaware. Nothing in this _Section 8.2_ shall affect the right of
any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

SECTION 8.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendments, Consents and Waivers_. This
Agreement, the Support Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto constitute the entire agreement
between and among the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and
discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties, and there are no
warranties, representations or other agreements between or among the parties
in connection with the subject matter hereof except as set forth specifically
herein or contemplated hereby. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement
(including the representations and warranties set forth in _Articles III_ and
_IV_ ), (a) the parties acknowledge and agree that neither the RRMS Group
Entities nor any other Person has made, directly or indirectly, and the Parent
Group Entities are not relying upon, any covenant, representation or warranty,
expressed or implied, as to the RRMS Group Entities or as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding any RRMS Group Entity furnished or
made available to any Parent Group Entity, (b) the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that, except as set forth in this Agreement, neither the Parent
Group Entities nor any other Person has made, directly or indirectly, and the
RRMS Group Entities are not relying upon, any covenant, representation or
warranty, expressed or implied, as to the Parent Group Entities or as to
the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding any Parent Group
Entity furnished or made available to any RRMS Group Entity, and (c) the RRMS
Parties and the Parent Parties shall not have or be subject to any liability
to any Parent Group Entity or any other Person or any RRMS Group Entity or
any other Person, as applicable, or any other remedy in connection herewith,
based upon the distribution to any Parent Group Entity or any RRMS Group
Entity of, or any Parent Group Entitys or any RRMS Group Entitys use of or
reliance on, any such information or any information, documents or material
made available to the Parent Group Parties or RRMS Group Parties, as
applicable, in any "data rooms," _ _ _"_ virtual data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with,
the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to compliance with applicable
Law, prior to the Closing, any provision of this Agreement may be (a)
consented to or waived in writing by the party benefited by the provision or
(b) amended or modified at any time by an agreement in writing by the parties
hereto; _provided, however_ , that, in addition to any other approvals
required by the RRMS Parties constituent documents or under this Agreement,
the foregoing consents, waivers, amendments or modifications in clauses (a)
and (b), and any decision or determination by RRMS to (x) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.2_ or _Section 7.3_ , or elect not to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _7.3(b)_ in the event this
Agreement becomes

  



57  terminable pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _7.3(b)_ , or (y) enforce this
Agreement (including pursuant to _Section 7.8_ ), must be approved by, in the
case of consents, waivers, amendments or modifications, or such decisions or
determinations, by any RRMS Party or the RRMS Board, the RRMS Conflicts
Committee. No amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement
shall be binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto. The
failure of a party to exercise any right or remedy shall not be deemed or
constitute a waiver of such right or remedy in the future. No waiver of any of
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver
of any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor shall any
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
provided.

 

SECTION 8.4 _Binding Effect; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; and Assignment_.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and
assigns, any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder, except (i) as provided
in _Section 5.9_ and (ii) for the right of the Holders of RRMS Common Units
(other than those subject to the RRMS Restricted Unit Awards) to receive
the Merger Consideration (including any Fractional Share Proceeds and other
distributions) after the Closing (a claim by the Holders of RRMS Common Units
with respect to which may not be made unless and until the Closing shall have
occurred). No party hereto may assign, transfer, dispose of or otherwise
alienate this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations under
this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise). Any attempted
assignment, transfer, disposition or alienation in violation of this
Agreement shall be null, void and ineffective.

SECTION 8.5 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of applicable
Law, or public policy, all other conditions or provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
affected in any matter materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

SECTION 8.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
constitute one instrument.
