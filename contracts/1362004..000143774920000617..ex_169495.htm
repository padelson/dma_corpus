and convey all of the Interests to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser desires to
purchase the Interests from the LLC Seller, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

 **WHEREAS** , on or prior to the Execution Date, the Individual Sellers and

($255,000,000.00) (" ** _Base Purchase Price_** "), as adjusted pursuant to
_Section_ _1.3_ _(a)_ (the " ** _Closing Purchase Price_** "), minus the
amounts paid pursuant to _Section 1.1(a_ _)_ through _Section 1.1_ _(d_ _)_
(without duplication of the adjustment to the Base Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 1.3(a)_ ) (such amount payable to the LLC Seller, the " ** _Seller_**
** _Closing Proceeds_** "). **** The Closing Purchase Price, as adjusted
pursuant to _Section_ _1.3(b)_ is referred to as the " ** _Purchase Price_**."

  



  

   

  



  

1.2 _Flow of Funds Memorandum_. Not later than three (3) days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a
flow of funds memorandum containing the Company's good faith estimate
(including all calculations in reasonable detail) of: (a) the Estimated Net
Working Capital (including the Estimated Accounts Receivable, Estimated
Prepaid Expenses, Estimated Accounts Payable and Estimated Accrued Expenses)

which schedule shall set forth the amount of unreimbursed Landlord
Contributions for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, as of the
Closing, and shall supersede and replace the version of such Schedule that are
attached hereto as of the date hereof (such statement, the " ** _Flow of Funds
Memorandum_** "). These calculations will be used in connection with the
payments described in _Section 1.1_. The Flow of Funds Memorandum also will
contain wire instructions for all of the foregoing payments (or instructions
to pay certain amounts by check).

  



  

1.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The purpose of the purchase price
adjustment set forth in this _Section_ _1.3_ is solely to measure any changes
in Net Working Capital from the target and Cash, Company Transaction Expenses
and Indebtedness from the estimated amounts to the final amounts on the same
accounting basis consistently applied by the Company prior to the Closing to
reflect the transactions or events up to, and conditions existing as of, the
Closing.

  



  

(a) _Preliminary Purchase Price Adjustment_. No later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing, the LLC Seller, in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 1.3(a)_ , shall prepare and deliver to the Purchaser an
estimated balance sheet for the Company as of the Closing (the " ** _Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet_** "), which Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall
include an estimation of (i) the Net Working Capital of the Company as of the
Closing (" ** _Estimated Net Working Capital_** ") and the Accounts Receivable
of the Company as of the Closing (" ** _Estimated Accounts Receivable_** "),
Prepaid Expenses of the Company as of the Closing (" ** _Estimated Prepaid
Expenses_** "), Accounts Payable of the Company as of the Closing (" **
_Estimated Accounts Payable_** "), and Accrued Expenses of the Company as of
the Closing (" ** _Estimated Accrued Expenses_** "); (ii) Estimated Cash and
Estimated Cash Offsets; (iii) Estimated Indebtedness; and (iv) the Estimated
Company Transaction Expenses. The LLC Seller shall provide the Purchaser with
reasonable access to the Company and relevant financial personnel in order to
allow the Purchaser to review the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the LLC
Seller will consider, in good faith, any comments made by the LLC Seller to
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. The LLC Seller shall calculate the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Net Working Capital,
Estimated Accounts Receivable, Estimated Prepaid Expenses, Estimated Accounts
Payable and Estimated Accrued Expenses in good faith and in a manner
consistent with the Net Working Capital Principles. The Base Purchase Price
will be adjusted as follows: (1) the Base Purchase Price will be decreased
dollar-for-dollar by the amount that Estimated Cash is less than the Estimated
Cash Offsets or increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount that Estimated Cash
is greater than the Estimated Cash Offsets; (2) the Base Purchase Price will
be decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount that Estimated Accounts
Receivable are less than the Target Accounts Receivable or increased dollar-
for-dollar by the amount that Estimated Accounts Receivable are greater than
the Target Accounts Receivable; (3) the Base Purchase Price will be decreased
dollar-for-dollar by the amount that Estimated Prepaid Expenses are less than
the Target Prepaid Expenses or increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount that
Estimated Prepaid Expenses are greater than the Target Prepaid Expenses; (4)
the Base Purchase Price will be decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount that
Estimated Accounts Payable exceed the Target Accounts Payable or increased
dollar-for-dollar by the amount that Estimated Accounts Payable are less than
the Target Accounts Payable; (5) the Base Purchase Price will be decreased
dollar-for-dollar by the amount that Estimated Accrued Expenses exceed the
Target Accrued Expenses or increased dollar-for-dollar by the amount that
Estimated Accrued Expenses are less than the Target Accrued Expenses; (6) the
Base Purchase Price will be decreased dollar-for-dollar by the amount of the
Estimated Indebtedness; and (7) the Base Purchase Price will be decreased
dollar-for-dollar by the amount of the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses.
The Closing Purchase Price will thereafter be subject to further adjustment as
provided in _Section 1.3(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt, no item shall be
double counted in the calculation of Net Working Capital, Accounts Receivable,
Prepaid Expenses, Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, Cash, Cash Offsets,
Indebtedness or Company Transaction Expenses.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(i) _Delivery of Closing Balance Sheet_.

  



  

(A) Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser
will, in good faith and in accordance with the terms of this _Section 1.3(b)_
, prepare and deliver to the LLC Seller (i) its good faith calculation of: (1)
the Final Net Working Capital (including Final Accounts Receivable, Final
Prepaid Expenses, Final Accounts Payable and Final Accrued Expenses) of the
Company as of the Closing, including the Purchaser's reasonably detailed
calculations of Net Working Capital (including Accounts Receivable, Prepaid
Expenses, Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses), showing in reasonable detail
any differences between the Purchaser's proposed calculation of Final Net
Working Capital (including Accounts Receivable, Prepaid Expenses, Accounts
Payable and Accrued Expenses) and the Estimated Net Working Capital (including
Accounts Receivable, Prepaid Expenses, Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses),
together with supporting documentation that is reasonably necessary to confirm
the differences between the Estimated Net Working Capital (including Estimated
Accounts Receivable, Estimated Prepaid Expenses, Estimated Accounts Payable
and Estimated Accrued Expenses) and the Purchaser's calculation of Net Working
Capital (including Accounts Receivable, Prepaid Expenses, Accounts Payable and
Accrued Expenses), (2) the Cash as of the Effective Time and the Cash Offsets
as of the Effective Time, (3) the Indebtedness as of the Effective Time, and
(4) the Company Transaction Expenses as of the Effective Time, and (ii) a
balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing (the " ** _Final Closing
Balance Sheet_** ", together with the information required under (i), the " **
_Final Closing Statement_** "). Calculation of the Final Net Working Capital
(including Final Accounts Receivable, Final Prepaid Expenses, Final Accounts
Payable and Final Accrued Expenses) and Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be
in a manner consistent with the Net Working Capital Principles. If the
Purchaser fails to deliver the Final Closing Statement to the LLC Seller
within the ninety (90) day period specified in this _Section 1.3(b)(i)(A)_ ,
at the LLC Seller's sole election and discretion, the Purchaser shall be
deemed to have accepted the Estimated Net Working Capital (including Estimated
Accounts Receivable, Estimated Prepaid Expenses, Estimated Accounts Payable
and Estimated Accrued Expenses) as final.

  



  

   

  



  

(B) The Final Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared, and Final Net
Working Capital, Final Accounts Receivable, Final Prepaid Expenses, Final
Accounts Payable, Final Accrued Expenses, Final Cash, Final Cash Offsets,
Final Company Transaction Expenses and Final Indebtedness shall be determined,
in accordance with this Agreement, including the Net Working Capital
Principles and definitions of Cash, Cash Offsets, Indebtedness, Company
Transaction Expenses, Accounts Receivable, Prepaid Expenses, Accounts Payable
and Accrued Expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, the Final Closing Statement,
the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Net Working Capital, Accounts
Receivable, Prepaid Expenses, Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, Cash, Cash
Offsets, Indebtedness and Company Transaction Expenses reflected therein shall
(i) exclude the impact of any decisions made or actions taken or omitted by
the Purchaser or the Company following the Closing, and (ii) not reflect
changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase accounting
adjustments or reflect any events, conditions or circumstances that arise as a
result of the change of control or ownership of the Company contemplated by
this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) _Review of Final Closing Balance Sheet; Objection_.

  



  

(A) The LLC Seller shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of
the Final Closing Statement and the Final Closing Balance Sheet and such
requested information as further specified herein to review the computations
reflected on the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Statement
(which requests for information may be made by LLC Seller via email). In
connection with such review, the Purchaser will make available to the LLC
Seller and its advisors all records and work papers relating to the Company
and the Purchaser's calculations set forth in the Final Closing Statement that
the LLC Seller and its advisors reasonably request in reviewing the Final
Closing Balance Sheet and Final Closing Statement, and the Purchaser will make
available to the LLC Seller and its advisors the personnel and other advisors
of Purchaser involved in the preparation of the Final Closing Balance Sheet
and the Final Closing Statement.

  



  

(B) If the LLC Seller disagrees with the Purchaser's Final Closing
Statement or Final Closing Balance Sheet, then the LLC Seller shall deliver
written notice (an " ** _Objection Notice_** ") of such disagreement to
Purchaser on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the LLC Seller's
receipt of the Final Closing Balance Sheet, Final Closing Statement, and all
information subsequently requested by the LLC Seller as specified above in
_Section_ _1.3(b)(ii)(A)_. If the LLC Seller delivered an Objection Notice to
the Purchaser, then the Purchaser and the LLC Seller will endeavor to resolve
any disagreements noted in the Objection Notice in good faith as soon as
practicable after the delivery of such notice, but if they do not obtain a
final resolution within thirty (30) days after the Purchaser has received the
Objection Notice, unless mutually extended by the parties in writing, then
either the Purchaser or the LLC Seller may thereafter commence the process to
jointly retain the Firm and each party must proceed with the Dispute
Resolution Procedure in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Receivable, Prepaid Expenses, Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses), as of

ordinary wear and tear (consistent with the age of such Leased Premises); (ii)
not in need of maintenance or repair except for ordinary routine maintenance

department, directorate or other similar designation within such U.S.
Government agency for the applicable program or contract award;

  



  

(ii) make any direct investment (whether equity, debt or other) or provide
any guaranty to, any Competing Business, except for investments of five
percent (5%) or less in a Competing Business that is publicly traded or
investments in a fund as long as no Seller has a management or decision making
role in the investment fund and no Seller is directly involved with any
investment in a Competing Business; or

solicit or induce, or otherwise knowingly encourage any Covered Employee to
terminate or otherwise adversely alter his or her employment or engagement

_5.13_ are reasonable and completely severable and independent, and any
invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement with respect to any one area
or any one restriction in this _Section_ _5.13_ shall not render this
Agreement unenforceable as applied to any one or more of the other areas or
other restrictions herein.

  



  

(d) The parties acknowledge that the restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ _5.13_ are necessary for the protection of the Purchaser and its
Affiliates and that any breach thereof may cause such Persons irreparable
damage, that such Person's remedies at law in the event of such breach may be
inadequate, and that, accordingly, the Purchaser may be entitled to seek the
issuance by a court of competent jurisdiction of a temporary, preliminary, or
permanent injunction in favor of such Person enjoining the breach or
threatened breach of such restrictions. The foregoing provision shall not
constitute a waiver of any other remedies that the Purchaser may have in law
or in equity.

respect to (1) actions the respective parties will take at the Closing itself
or (2) conditions that require the Purchaser's cooperation pursuant to
_Section_ _5.9_ if the Purchaser is in breach of such cooperation covenants)
and that the Company is ready, willing and able to close, and the Purchaser
has not agreed to close within fifteen (15) days thereof;

  



  

   

  



  

(c) by the Purchaser, if the Closing has not occurred on or before the End
Date, _provided_ , that such failure is not due to a failure of the Purchaser
to perform, in any material respect, any of its material obligations under
this Agreement (provided, further, that if the Company has sent the notice to
the Purchaser referred to in _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ , the Purchaser may not
exercise its right under this _Section 8.1(c))_ ;

  



  

(d) by the Company, if the Purchaser has committed a material breach of

a condition set forth in _Section_ _6.2_ and (ii) such breach is not capable
of being cured or, if capable of being cured, has not been cured prior to the
earlier of (A) ten (10) days following written notice of such breach from the

(e) by the Purchaser, if the Company has committed a material breach of

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is validly terminated as
provided in _Section _ _8.1_ , all further obligations under this Agreement
will terminate and no party hereto will have any liability in respect of the

described in _Section_ _5.6_ will survive any such termination and (b)
_Sections_ _11_ through _22_ , _23(a)_ , _24_ , _25_ , any applicable
definitions set forth in _Section_ _26_ and this _Section_ _8.2_ , shall
survive any such termination, and (c) no such termination will relieve any
party from liability for Fraud in connection with this Agreement or for any
willful and material breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement prior to such termination, and in the event of such Fraud or such
willful and material breach, the parties hereto will be entitled to exercise
any and all remedies available under law or equity in accordance with this
Agreement. For purposes of clarification, the parties agree that if the
Purchaser does not close the transactions contemplated hereby in circumstances
in which all of the closing conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_
have been satisfied or waived by the LLC Seller (other than conditions to be
performed at the Closing or that require Purchaser's cooperation pursuant to
_Section 5.9_ ), such failure or refusal to close shall be deemed to be a
willful breach of this Agreement by Purchaser. Nothing in this _Section 8.2_
shall relieve or release any party hereto of any liability or damages (which
the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of
expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include to the extent proven the
benefit of the bargain lost by a party (taking into consideration relevant
matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value of
money, which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such party))
arising out of such party's willful breach of this Agreement.

9.1 _Survival_.

to the Closing will survive the Effective Time. The covenants contained in
this Agreement to be performed after the Closing, and the indemnification
obligations of the parties with respect thereto, shall survive the Closing to

with respect to the matters in Sections 9.2(a)(iv) though (viii) and 9.4(c)
and (d) shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations.

  



  

   

  



  

9.2 _Sellers ' Indemnification Obligations_

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Section 9_ , the Sellers,
jointly and severally, shall indemnify and defend the Purchaser, its
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents (collectively, the " ** _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_** " and each a
" ** _Purchaser Indemnified Party_** ") against and from all Damages suffered,
sustained or incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party, whether in respect
of third party claims or claims between the parties hereto relating to, as a
result of or arising out of:

  



  

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation and warranty made by
the Company or Sellers to the Purchaser under Section 2 or Section 3 (other
than Fundamental Seller Representations and the representations and warranties
under _Section 2._ _6_ and _Section 3.31_ ) or by the Company or Sellers in
any certificate delivered by the Company or Sellers at Closing pursuant to
_Section_ _7.1_ ;

  



  

(ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Seller
Representations;

  



  

(iii) any breach by the Sellers of, or failure by the Sellers to comply
with, any covenant or obligation under this Agreement to be performed by
Sellers;

  



  

(iv) any Pre-Closing Taxes;

  



  

(v) any Fraud of the Sellers;

  



  

(vi) any unpaid Indebtedness or Company Transaction Expenses;

the extent any adjustments relate to the portion of such period prior to
Closing; and

  



  

(viii) the matters set forth on _Schedule 9.2(a)(viii)_.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for
purposes of determining whether there has been a breach and the amount of any
Damages that are the subject matter of a claim for indemnification hereunder,
each representation and warranty in this Agreement and the schedules and
exhibits hereto shall be read without regard and without giving effect to any
"materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" qualification contained in such
representation or warranty which has the effect of making such representation
and warranty less likely to be breached (as if such word or words were deleted
from such representation or warranty); except, however, the foregoing proviso
shall not apply for purposes of the use of the phrase "Material Adverse
Effect" in _Section_ _2._ _6_ , _Section 3.30_ or _Section 3.31_ and shall not
apply to the defined terms "Material Contracts," "Material Customers" or
"Material Suppliers." For the avoidance of doubt, the materiality scrape in
this _Section 9.2(b)_ does not except out materiality as an element of Fraud
nor does it except out any reference to "Material Adverse Effect" or
"material" or any similar qualification from any representation and warranty
for purposes of determining Fraud.

  



  

   

  



  

9.3 _Limitation on Sellers ' Indemnification Obligations_. Sellers'

under _Section_ _9.2(a)(i)_ until the total amount of Damages which the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties would recover under _Section 9.2(a)_ _(i)_

in which case the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover
such Damages that exceed the Threshold.

  



  

(b) Other than for Damages resulting from claims brought on the basis of
Fraud, the aggregate amount of indemnification that the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties may receive to satisfy claims under _Section 9.2(a)_ _(i)_ shall be
$956,250.00 (the " ** _Cap_** ").

  



  

(c) The aggregate liability of the Sellers pursuant to _Section 9.2_
shall in no event exceed the amount of the cash proceeds actually received by
the LLC Seller under this Agreement.

  



  

(d) With respect to Damages for which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)_ such Damages shall be paid

second, from the RandW Insurance Policy to the extent of the coverage limits
under the RandW Insurance Policy, and (iii) third, from the Sellers (in each
case subject to the limitations in this _Section 9_ ). For the sake of
clarity, to the extent any facts giving rise to any indemnifiable Damages
constitute a breach of a representation or warranty, and except in the case of
Fraud, to the extent that such Damages are covered under the RandW Insurance
Policy and the limit of liability under the RandW Insurance Policy has not been
exhausted, the Purchaser shall first be required to use Reasonable Best
Efforts to recover from and exhaust the RandW Insurance Policy before seeking
recovery directly from the Sellers under clause (iii) above.

  



  

9.4 _Purchaser 's Indemnification Obligations_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Section, the Purchaser shall indemnify and defend the

Purchaser at Closing pursuant to _Section 7.2_ ;

  



  

(b) any inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Purchaser
Representations;

  



  

(c) any and all Transfer Taxes required to be borne by Purchaser pursuant
to _Section 10.3(h)_ ;

recover under _Section 9.4(a)_ exceeds an aggregate amount equal to the
Threshold, in which case the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
recover such Damages that exceed the Threshold.

  



  

(b) Other than for Damages resulting from claims brought on the basis of
Fraud, the aggregate amount of indemnification that the Seller Indemnified
Parties may receive to satisfy claims under _Section 9.4(a)_ shall be the
Cap.

  



  

9.6 _Notice and Procedure._

  



  

(a) In the event that any Legal Proceedings are instituted by a third
party or any claim or demand is asserted or threatened against or sought to be
collected from a Person who is seeking indemnity under any provision of this
Agreement (the " ** _Indemnitee_** ") by a third party, in each case for which
the party from whom indemnity is sought (the " ** _Indemnitor_** ") may have
liability to any Indemnitee hereunder (a " ** _Third Party Claim_** "), such
Indemnitee shall, promptly following such Indemnitee's receipt of a Third
Party Claim, notify the Indemnitor in writing of such Third Party Claim (a "
** _Claim Notice_** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give a
timely Claim Notice shall relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder
only if and to the extent that such failure has a materially prejudicial
effect on the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnitor with
respect to such Third Party Claim or the Indemnitor is otherwise materially
prejudiced by such delay. The Indemnitor shall have thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Claim Notice (the " ** _Notice Period_** ") to notify the
Indemnitee that it desires to defend the Indemnitee against such Third Party
Claim; _provided, however_ , that in such notice the Indemnitor must agree to
indemnify the Indemnitee from and against the entirety of any and all Damages
the Indemnitee may suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the
nature of or caused by the Third Party Claim (subject to the limitations of
this _Section 9_ ). The Indemnitee shall deliver to the Indemnitor, upon
request and without charge, copies of any demand, complaint and other material
correspondence and documents served on or received by the Indemnitee with
respect to such Third Party Claim.

  



  

(b) In the event that the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee within the
Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnitee against a Third Party
Claim, (i) the Indemnitor shall have the right to defend the Indemnitee by
appropriate Legal Proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and
control such defense, with counsel of its choosing, at its expense, (ii) the
Indemnitor shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to defend diligently such
Third Party Claim, and (iii) the Indemnitee, prior to the period in which the
Indemnitor assumes the defense of such matter, may take such reasonable
actions to preserve any and all rights with respect to such matter, without
such actions being construed as a waiver of the Indemnitee's rights to defense
and indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, but with such actions not
being determinative of the amount of any Damages. The Indemnitor shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), settle, compromise or offer
to settle or compromise any Third Party Claim that does not include as a term
thereof the giving by the Person(s) asserting such Third Party Claim to
Indemnitee a release from all liability with respect to such claim or consent
to entry of any judgment.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) If the Indemnitor (i) does not elect to defend the Indemnitee against
a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnitee timely notice of its
desire to so defend or otherwise or (ii) after assuming the defense of a Third
Party Claim, fails to take commercially reasonable steps necessary to defend
diligently such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right but not
the obligation to assume such defense and shall have the sole power to direct
and control such defense, with counsel of its choosing, at the expense of the
Indemnitor; it being understood that the Indemnitee's right to indemnification
for a Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by assuming the
defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnitee shall not settle a Third
Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(d) The Indemnitee and the Indemnitor shall cooperate in the conduct of
the defense of a Third Party Claim, including by providing reasonable access
to each other's relevant business records and other documents, and employees,
subject to reasonable confidentiality obligations. The party that controls the
defense, compromise or settlement of a Third Party Claim shall keep the other
party reasonably informed of material developments and events relating to such
claim.

  



  

(e) The Indemnitee and the Indemnitor shall use their Reasonable Best
Efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

  



  

(f) Any claim by an Indemnitee for indemnification not involving a Third
Party Claim may be asserted by giving the Indemnitor written notice thereof (a
" ** _Notice of Direct Claim_** "), which notice shall say "Direct Indemnity
Claim", and shall be given promptly after the Indemnitee becomes aware of such
claim. Such Notice of Direct Claim must state that the Indemnitee, in good
faith, believes it is entitled to indemnification and the relevant section(s)
of this Agreement pursuant to which the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification and contain to the extent possible, a good faith estimate of
the Damages that the Indemnitee has incurred or paid or will incur or pay as a
result of the matter giving rise to such right of indemnification or a
statement explaining why such amount cannot be reasonably estimated. The
Indemnitor shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of a Notice of Direct
Claim to respond in writing to such Notice of Direct Claim. During such period
of thirty (30) days, the Indemnitee shall cooperate in all reasonable respects
with the Indemnitor and its professional advisors in their investigation of
the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Notice of Direct Claim,
and whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Notice
of Direct Claim, and the Indemnitee shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to
assist the Indemnitor's investigation by giving such non-privileged
information and assistance at the Indemnitor's sole expense, as the Indemnitor
or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request in order to
evaluate such Notice of Direct Claim. If the Indemnitor does not notify the
Indemnitee within thirty (30) days following its receipt of a Notice of Direct
Claim that the Indemnitor disputes its liability to the Indemnitee, such claim
specified by the Indemnitee in such notice shall be conclusively deemed
rejected by the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee will be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee pursuant to _Section 20_ ,
subject to the terms and limitations set forth in this _Section 9_.

  



  

   

  



  

9.7 _Duty to Mitigate_. Any Person seeking indemnification under this
_Section 9_ shall take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any
Damages incurred by such Person upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
indemnification rights hereunder.

  



  

9.8 _No Duplicate Recovery_. Any indemnifiable Damages for which any
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Section 9 shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such indemnifiable Damages constituting a breach of more than
one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. There shall be no
recovery for any indemnifiable Damages by any Indemnitee pursuant to this
Section 9 to the extent such Damages have been taken into account in the
determination of the Purchase Price Adjustment.

  



  

9.9 _Time of Payment of Claims_. Any amount owing by any party hereto
pursuant to this Section 9 shall be paid within five (5) Business Days after
the final determination of such amount in accordance with this Section 9.

  



  

9.10 _Sole Remedy After Closing_.

  



  

(a) The Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge and agree that their sole and
exclusive remedy for monetary relief with respect to any breach of this
Agreement, including breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement and with respect to any and all claims relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, excluding (i) any claim for Fraud or (ii) any
remedies with respect to the Purchase Price adjustment as contained in
_Section 1.3_, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth
in this _Section 9_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , nothing contained herein shall
prevent the Indemnitee from pursuing equitable relief as may be available to
such party under _Section 11_. The parties shall not be entitled to a
rescission of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (whether by contract, common law, statute, law,
regulation or otherwise), all of which the parties hereby waive.

  



  

(b) The Purchaser and Sellers agree to treat (and cause their Affiliates
to treat) any indemnification payment under this Agreement as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes. Neither the Purchaser nor any Seller
shall (nor shall they permit their Affiliates to) take any position on any Tax
Return, or before any Governmental Authority involved in the administration of
Tax Laws, that is inconsistent with such treatment. The parties hereto agree
to use their Reasonable Best Efforts to obtain available recoveries from any
third party insurer (including with respect to the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, from the RandW Insurance Provider). Any indemnification obligation
under this Agreement shall be net of (i) any Tax Benefit realizable by the
Indemnitee or its Affiliates, and (ii) any insurance proceeds or any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the Indemnitee or
its Affiliates from any third party with respect thereto, net of any expenses
and increase in applicable premiums/retro-premiums related to the recovery of
such proceeds. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is received by
any Indemnitee with respect to any indemnification obligation for which any
such Person has been indemnified under this Agreement, then a refund equal to
the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the Indemnitor.
As used herein, " ** _Tax Benefit_** " shall mean the Tax savings attributable
to any deduction, expense, loss, credit or refund to the Indemnitee or its
Affiliates, when incurred or received.

  



  

   

  



  

9.11 _No Right of Contribution_. The Sellers hereby expressly waive,
acknowledge and agree that the Sellers shall not exercise or assert (or
attempt to exercise or assert) any right of subrogation, contribution,
advancement, indemnification or other claim against the Company in connection
with any indemnification obligation or any Damages to which any Seller may
become subject under this Agreement or otherwise; provided, however, that
nothing in this _Section 9.11_ shall release the right of the Sellers (i) with
respect to the obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or (ii) the obligations of any insurer under any
insurance policy (including under the Tail Policy).

  



  

9.12 _Indemnity Escrow Account_. On the first Business Day following the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " ** _Escrow
Termination Date_** "), Purchaser and LLC Seller shall promptly deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent as is necessary to cause the
remaining funds on deposit in the Indemnity Escrow Account, minus the
aggregate amount of any unsatisfied claims for Damages of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties properly made on or prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on
the Escrow Termination Date in accordance with the terms of this _Section_ _9_
(the " ** _Pending Claim Reserve_** "), to be released to the LLC Seller. The
Pending Claim Reserve shall remain in the Indemnity Escrow Account until the
resolution of the applicable claim or claims to which such reserve relates. To
the extent such pending claim or claims are resolved in favor of the
Purchaser, the Pending Claim Reserve shall be paid to Purchaser, with any
amount remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account after such payment to be
released to the LLC Seller.

  



  

 **10. POST CLOSING MATTERS**. Following the Closing Date, the parties
agree as follows:

  



  

10.1 _Cooperation_. In case at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the
parties will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of
such further instruments and documents) as any other party reasonably may
request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting party.

  



  

10.2 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any party is
actively contesting or defending against any Claim in connection with (a) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (b) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act or transaction that existed on or prior to
the Closing Date involving the Company, each of the other parties will
cooperate with such party and such party's counsel in the contest or defense,
make available their personnel, and provide such testimony and access to their
books and records as will be reasonably necessary in connection with the
contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or
defending party.

  



  

10.3 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Refunds._ Any refund of Taxes that were imposed on the Company
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any interest paid or credited in respect
thereto (collectively, a " ** _Tax Refund_** "), shall be the property of the
LLC Seller. If any such Tax Refund is received by the Purchaser, the Company
or any of their Affiliates, including by way of credit or allowance against
Taxes otherwise payable, an amount equal to such Tax Refund, together with any
interest payable thereon, shall be paid to the LLC Seller promptly upon
receipt from the applicable Governmental Authority. The Purchaser shall
consider, if the LLC Seller so requests and at the LLC Seller's expense,
causing the relevant entity to file for and obtain any Tax Refund to which the
LLC Seller is entitled under this _Section_ _10.3(a)_. For purposes of this
_Section 10.3(a)_ , if (x) the amount of Taxes in respect of a Straddle Tax
Period paid by the Company on or before the Closing Date or taken into account
in Net Working Capital, exceeds (y) the amount of such Taxes relating to the
portion of such Straddle Tax Period ending on the Closing Date (as determined,
under _Section 10.3(b))_ , such excess shall be treated as a Tax Refund.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) _Straddle Tax Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, Tax
liabilities with respect to a Tax period which begins on or before and ends
after the Closing Date (a " ** _Straddle Tax Period_** ") shall be apportioned
between the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date and the portion
beginning on the day after the Closing Date. The portion of any Taxes for any
Straddle Tax Period allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined as follows: (i) in the case of any real and personal property Taxes
and franchise Taxes not based on gross or net income, based on the total
amount of such Taxes for the relevant Straddle Tax Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days in such Straddle
Tax Period through the Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be the
total number of days in such Straddle Tax Period, and (ii) in the case of any
Taxes other than those described in clause (i), as if such taxable period
ended at the close of the Closing Date; _provided_ , however, that for
purposes of this clause (ii), any transactions outside the Ordinary Course of
Business of the Company following the Closing on the Closing Date shall be
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Tax Period following the Closing
Date.

  



  

(c) _Tax Returns_. The LLC Seller shall prepare and timely file, or shall
cause to be prepared and timely filed, any income Tax Returns required to be
filed by or with respect to the Company for all Tax periods ending on or
before the Closing Date which have not been filed as of the Closing Date (such
Tax Returns, " ** _Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns_** "). In order to
facilitate preparation of such Tax Returns, the Purchaser shall, within a
reasonable period of time after the LLC Seller's written request, provide the
LLC Seller with such information as the LLC Seller shall identify that is
reasonably necessary for preparing Tax Returns described in this _Section_
_10.3(c)_. The LLC Seller shall permit the Purchaser to review and comment on
any Pre-Closing Period Tax Return that relates solely to the Company (and not
any returns that include the LLC Seller or any Affiliate) at least thirty (30)
days prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing such Pre-Closing
Period Tax Return and make any changes reasonably requested by the Purchaser,
with any dispute relating thereto to be resolved by the Firm. The Purchaser
shall execute and file or cause to be executed and filed all such Pre-Closing
Period Tax Returns on or prior to the due date (including extensions) for
filing such Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns. The Purchaser, at the LLC Seller's
expense, shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed, any other Tax Returns first required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company for all Tax periods ending on or before the Closing
Date which have not been filed as of the Closing Date and any Tax Returns
required to be filed for any Straddle Tax Periods. The Purchaser, at the LLC
Seller's expense, shall permit the LLC Seller to review and comment on any
such Tax Return that could result in a claim for indemnity against the LLC
Seller under this Agreement at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date
(including extensions) for filing such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return or
Straddle Tax Period Tax Return and make any changes reasonably requested by
the LLC Seller, with any dispute relating thereto to be resolved by the Firm.

  



  

(d) _Cooperation_. **** In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns
and audit examinations relating to the Company by any Governmental Authority
or administrative or judicial proceedings resulting therefrom, the LLC Seller
and the Purchaser will cooperate fully with one another, including the
furnishing or making available on a timely basis of records, personnel (as
reasonably required), books of account, powers of attorney or other materials
necessary or helpful for the preparation of Tax Returns, the conduct of audit
examinations or the defense of claims by Taxing Authorities as to the
imposition of Taxes.

  



  

   

  



  

(e) _Tax Contests_. After the Closing Date, except as set forth in this
_Section_ _10.3(e)_ , the Company shall control the conduct, through counsel
of its own choosing, of any audit or administrative or judicial proceeding
involving any asserted Tax liability with respect to the Company (each a " **
_Tax Contest_** "). In the case of a Tax Contest after the Closing Date that
relates solely to income Taxes in Pre-Closing Tax Periods, the LLC Seller may
elect to control the conduct of such Tax Contest, using counsel or accountants
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, but the Company shall have the right
to participate in such Tax Contest at its own expense, and the LLC Seller
shall not settle, compromise or concede any portion of such Tax Contest that
could affect the income Tax liability of the Company for any taxable year (or
portion thereof) after the Closing Date without the written consent of the
Company, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; provided that, if the LLC Seller fails to assume control of the
conduct of any such Tax Contest within thirty (30) days following the receipt
by the LLC Seller of Notice of such Tax Contest from the Purchaser, then the
Company shall have the right to assume control of such Tax Contest. In the
case of any Tax Contest relating to any Taxes in a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including any Straddle Tax Period) that is not controlled by the LLC Seller
pursuant to this _Section_ _10.3(e)_ , (i) the LLC Seller shall have the right
to participate in such Tax Contest at the expense of the LLC Seller and (ii)
the Purchaser shall not allow the Company to settle or otherwise resolve such
Tax Contest without the prior written permission of the LLC Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, in each
case only to the extent such Tax Contest could result in the LLC Seller being
liable pursuant to this Agreement or under applicable Law.

  



  

(f) _Purchaser Tax Actions_. Except as otherwise required under
applicable Law, following the Closing, neither the Purchaser nor the Company
will (and neither the Purchaser nor the Company will allow any of its
Affiliates to): (i) file, amend or modify any Tax Return of the Company for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Tax Period), (ii) file,
amend or revoke any Tax election for the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(other than a Straddle Tax Period), (iii) surrender any right to claim a
refund of Taxes relating to the Company relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (iv) enter into any closing agreement relating to any Tax Return of
the Company for any tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, or (v)
make a voluntary disclosure to a Governmental Authority with respect to any
Tax or Tax Returns of the Company for any tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date, in each case, without the prior written consent of the LLC
Seller.

  



  

(g) _Tax Treatment_. The Purchaser and its Affiliates, the Company, and
the LLC Seller agree with respect to certain Tax matters as follows:

  



  

(i) To treat any Transaction Tax Deductions paid or accrued on or before
the Closing Date as deductible in a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the fullest
extent allowable by applicable Laws and no party hereto shall apply the "next
day rule" under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) to such
deductions.

  



  

(ii) Except as provided in clause (i), to treat any gains, income,
deductions, losses, or other items realized by the Company for income Tax
purposes with respect to any transaction outside the Ordinary Course of
Business of the Company following the Closing on the Closing Date as occurring
on the day immediately following the Closing Date and apply the "next day
rule" under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(iv)(B) to such items.

  



  

   

  



  

(iii) That no election shall be made by any party under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2) (or any similar provision of state, local,
or non-U.S. Law) to ratably allocate items incurred by the Company for the
year in which the Closing occurs. ** **

  



  

Unless otherwise required by a final determination of a Governmental
Authority, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to file all Tax Returns
consistently with the agreements set forth in this _Section_ _10.3(g)_ and not
take any position inconsistent with the agreement in this _Section_ _10.3(g)_
during an audit or other proceeding with any Governmental Authority.

  



  

(h) _Transfer Taxes_. Any and all transfer, documentary, sales, use,
registration and real property transfer or gains Tax, stamp Tax, excise Tax,
stock transfer Tax, or other similar Tax imposed as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " ** _Transfer
Taxes_** ") and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes
shall be borne 50% by the Purchaser and 50% by the LLC Seller. The Purchaser
and the LLC Seller agree to cooperate to establish any available exemption
from (or otherwise reduce) any such Transfer Taxes, and also agree to
cooperate in the filing of any Tax Returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes,
including by promptly supplying any information in their possession that is
reasonably necessary to complete such Tax Returns.

  



  

(i) _Purchase Price Allocation_. Within thirty (30) days after the date
that the Purchase Price is determined (as set forth herein), the Purchaser
will cause The McLean Group (with the approval of Grant Thornton) to allocate
the Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Regulations promulgated thereunder (the " ** _Allocation Schedule_** "). The
Allocation Schedule as finally determined by The McLean Group (with the
approval of Grant Thornton) pursuant to this Section 10.3(i) shall be binding
on the parties and all Tax Returns filed by the Purchaser and its Affiliates
and the LLC Seller will be prepared consistently with such Allocation
Schedule.

  



  

 **11. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE**. Each of the Purchaser, the Sellers, and
the Company acknowledges that the other parties may be irreparably harmed and
that there may be no adequate remedy at law for any violation by any of them
of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to, but not in lieu of, any other
remedies that may be available upon the breach of any such covenants or
agreements (including remedies under _Section_ _9_ ), each party shall have
the right to seek injunctive relief to restrain a breach or threatened breach
of, or otherwise to seek specific performance of, the other parties' covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable
relief on the basis that the party seeking such injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief has an adequate remedy at law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or equity. In the event that any party seeks an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, such party shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction
or other order, decree, ruling or judgment.

  



  

   

  



  

 **12. PUBLIC STATEMENTS**. (a) Prior to the Closing, (i) neither the
Company nor any Seller, without the prior written approval of the Purchaser,
and (ii) the Purchaser, without the prior written approval of the LLC Seller,
and (b) following the Closing (i) the Sellers will not, without the prior
written approval of the Purchaser, and (ii) neither the Purchaser nor the
Company, without the prior written approval of the LLC Seller, will (1) make
any press release or other public announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent required by Law, in which
case the other party will be so advised as far in advance as possible and will
be given an opportunity to comment on such release or announcement, or (2)
disclose the Purchase Price, the approximate amount of the Purchase Price, any
other financial information from which the approximate amount of the Purchase
Price may be determined, or disclose any of the other essential terms of this
Agreement and except as required by Law or required for financial reporting
purposes and except that the parties (or their respective Affiliates) may
disclose such terms to their respective employees, accountants, advisors and
other Representatives or their respective past, present or prospective
financing sources or other investors as necessary in connection with the
ordinary conduct of their respective businesses (so long as such Persons agree
to or are bound by contract to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential
on terms substantially similar to those set forth in this Agreement that are
applicable to the disclosing party hereunder).

  



  

 **13. EXPENSES**. Except as expressly set forth herein, each party shall
bear its own legal and other fees and expenses incurred in connection with its
negotiating, executing and performing this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, including any related investment banking broker or finder's fees
with which any of them have contracted, for periods on or before the Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser shall be responsible for 50%
and the LLC Seller shall be responsible for 50% of the RandW Insurance Expenses
and the HSR Act related filing fees.

  



  

 **14. AMENDMENT AND ASSIGNABILITY**. This Agreement may be amended only
by the execution and delivery of a written instrument by or on behalf of (a)
prior to the Closing, all of the parties hereto and (b) after the Closing, the
Purchaser and the LLC Seller. This Agreement will be binding upon and will
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto in their sole discretion.

party hereby waives the application of any rule of law that would otherwise be
applicable in connection with the interpretation of this Agreement, including
any rule of law to the effect that any provision of this Agreement will be
interpreted or construed against the party whose counsel drafted that
provision. This Agreement constitutes notice to the Purchaser that the Company
has engaged Holland and Knight LLP as its legal counsel in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and the Purchaser hereby (i)
consents to the continued representation of the Company by Holland and Knight
LLP in relation to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding the fact that Holland and Knight LLP may have represented, and
may currently or in the future represent, the Purchaser and/or any of its
Affiliates with respect to unrelated matters and (ii) waives any actual or
alleged conflict and actual or alleged violation of ethical or comparable
rules applicable to Holland and Knight LLP, as applicable, that may arise from
their representation of the Company and/or its Affiliates in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including representing the
Company or its Affiliates against the Purchaser and/or any of its Affiliates
in litigation, arbitration or mediation in connection therewith. In addition,
the Purchaser hereby acknowledges that its consent and waiver under this
paragraph is voluntary and informed, and that the Purchaser has obtained
independent legal advice with respect to this consent and waiver.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) The parties agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Holland and Knight
LLP has represented the Company in connection with this Agreement, and may
have also represented the Company in connection with matters other than the
transaction that is the subject of this Agreement prior to Closing, Holland and
Knight LLP will be permitted in the future, prior to and after the Closing, to
represent one or more of such Affiliates, or their respective equity holders,
officers, directors or managers in connection with matters in which such
Affiliates or their respective equity holders, officers, directors or managers
are adverse to the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, including
any disputes that such Affiliates or their respective equity holders,
officers, directors or managers may hereafter have with the Company and/or
with the Purchaser arising out of, or related to, this Agreement. The Company
and the Purchaser, who is represented by independent counsel in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, hereby agree, in
advance, to waive any actual or potential conflict of interest that may
hereafter arise in connection with Holland and Knight's future representation of
one or more of the Company's Affiliates or their respective equity holders,
officers, directors or managers on matters in which the Interests of such
Affiliate or their respective equity holders, officers, directors or managers
are adverse to the Interests of the Company and/or the Purchaser, including

vested solely in the Sellers, and (ii) any and all protections from
disclosure, including attorney-client privileges and work product protections,
associated with or arising from any Protected Communications that would have
been exercisable by the Company shall thereupon be vested exclusively in the
Sellers and shall be exercised or waived solely by the Sellers. All rights,
files, and information that are not Protected Communications, including
matters that relate to the operation of the Company shall belong to the
Company. Neither the Company, Purchaser or any Person acting on any of their
behalf shall, without the prior written consent of the LLC Seller, assert or
waive or attempt to assert or waive any such protection against disclosure of
Protected Communications, including the attorney-client privilege or work
product protection with respect to, or to discover, obtain, use or disclose or
attempt to discover, obtain, use or disclose any Protected Communications in
connection with any dispute with Sellers or the Company relating to this
Agreement, or any of the transactions contemplated herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser or the
Company, on the one hand, and a Person other than the Sellers or one of his,
her or its Affiliates, on the other hand, after the Closing, the Purchaser and
the Company, as applicable, may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of Protected Communications to such third party.

Knight LLP under _Section_ ___23_ , this Agreement will not confer any rights

Appendices, and Disclosure Schedules referenced in this Agreement are a
material part of this Agreement. Each Disclosure Schedule will be deemed

Agreement and shall not be deemed to expand in any way the scope or effect of
any such representations, warranties, or covenants. No Disclosure Schedule
relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement, law or
regulation shall be construed as an admission that any such breach or
violation has actually occurred. No reference to or disclosure of any item or
other matter in the Disclosure Schedules will be construed as an admission or
indication that such item or other matter disclosed is material or such item
or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the Disclosure
Schedules. Disclosures made for the purpose of any one Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed made for the purpose of all representations and warranties so
long as the applicability to the other representations and warranties is
reasonably apparent from such disclosure. Any reference to a contract,
statement, plan, report or other document of any kind in the Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed to be a disclosure thereof to the extent the
applicable representation or warranty calls for a listing of the same and it
shall not in such case be necessary to identify or reference specific
provisions of such documents except to the extent necessary to clarify or
qualify such disclosure.

terms reasonably satisfactory to the LLC Seller and the Purchaser. The

Firm during its resolution of any disagreements included in the Objection
Notice. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, the Firm shall make
its determination in accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth
in this Agreement and on _Exhibit _ _C_ ; provided that any delay in
delivering such determination shall not invalidate the award or otherwise
deprive the Firm of jurisdiction. The Firm will consider only those items and
amounts set forth in the Objection Notice that the Purchaser on the one hand
and the LLC Seller on the other hand are unable to resolve. In resolving any
disputed item, the Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by any party or less than the smallest
value for such item claimed by any party. Except as otherwise specified
herein, the scope of the disputes to be determined by the Firm is limited to
whether the preparation of the Final Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation
of Net Working Capital were done in a manner consistent with _Section_
_1.3(b)_ and whether there were mathematical errors in the preparation of the
Final Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of Net Working Capital, and the
Firm is not to make any other determination unless requested in writing by the
LLC Seller and the Purchaser. The Firm's determination of Net Working Capital,
including each of the components thereof, shall be based solely on written
materials submitted by the Purchaser and the LLC Seller ( _i.e._ , not on
independent review) and on the definitions included herein. The fees and
disbursements of the Firm and the reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of
the parties (collectively, the " ** _Purchase Price Adjustment Dispute
Expenses_** ") shall be borne (i) by the Purchaser in the proportion that the
aggregate dollar amount of the disputed items that are successfully disputed
by the LLC Seller (as finally determined by the Firm) bears to the aggregate
dollar amount of all disputed items and (ii) by the LLC Seller in accordance
with the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of the disputed items
that are unsuccessfully disputed by the LLC Seller (as finally determined by
the Firm) bears to the aggregate dollar amount of all disputed items. For
example, if the parties dispute $1,000,000 of a proposed Purchase Price
Adjustment to be paid to the LLC Seller, the Firm determines that such payment
should be $400,000 and the Purchase Price Adjustment Dispute Expenses are
$100,000, then (i) the Purchaser shall pay $40,000 (40%) of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Dispute Expenses and (ii) by the LLC Seller shall pay $60,000 (60%)
of the Purchase Price Adjustment Dispute Expenses. The determination of the
Firm as to any disputed matters shall be set forth in a written report of
award delivered to the Purchaser and the LLC Seller, and shall be deemed
final, conclusive and binding on the parties and shall not be subject to
collateral attack for any reason. The parties agree that judgment may be
entered upon the written report of award of the Firm in any court located in
Arlington, Virginia. Prior to the Firm's determination as provided for herein,
(i) the Purchaser, on the one hand, and by the LLC Seller, on the other hand,
will each pay fifty percent (50%) of any retainer paid to the Firm; and (ii)
during the engagement of the Firm, the Firm will bill fifty percent (50%) of
the total charges to each of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and by the LLC
Seller, on the other hand. In connection with the Firm's determination as
provided for herein, the Firm shall also determine, taking into account all
fees and expenses already paid by each of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the LLC Seller, on the other hand, as of the date of such determination, the
allocation of the Purchase Price Adjustment Dispute Expenses between the
Purchaser and the LLC Seller, which such determination shall be conclusive and
binding upon the parties hereto.
