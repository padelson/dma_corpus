the Merger and without action on the part of any of Parent, the Merger Sub,
the Company or its shareholders, the following shall occur:

  



  

(a) _Conversion of Company Stock_. Each share of Company Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any

shareholders exercising dissenters rights pursuant to Section 23B.13 of the
WBCA (" _Dissenting Shareholders_ "), which are provided for in Section
2.10), shall be cancelled, retired and shall cease to exist and shall be
converted into and represent, upon surrender of a Certificate formerly
representing such share in the manner provided in this Agreement, the right

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly
and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Company.

  



  

Section 2.08 _Calculation and Payment of the Closing Date Consideration_.

  



  

(a) The consideration for all of the Company Stock, Company Options and
Company Warrants shall be comprised of all of the amounts payable under
Schedule X (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). The
Merger Consideration shall be paid in accordance with Schedule X, Section
2.07, this Section 2.08, Section 2.11, Section 2.13, Section 2.14 and
Section 2.15.

  



  

(b) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Shareholder Representative shall deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a schedule
setting forth (i) the portion of the Closing Date Consideration payable to
each Shareholder that is not an Executive Shareholder, (ii) the portion of
the Closing Date Consideration payable to each Shareholder that is an
Executive Shareholder, which amount shall be paid (A) in the case of Rick
Hennessey and Scott Weller, 75% in cash and 25% in Parent Shares and (B) in
the case of Scott Frodle and Mark Gosselin, 50% in cash and 50% in Parent
Shares, with all such Parent Shares issued to the Executive Shareholders (the
" _Stock Consideration_ ") in each case valued at the Closing Date Reference
Price and rounded down to the nearest whole share, (iii) the Company Debt
Amount as of the Closing Date, and (iv) the estimated Company Transaction
Costs payable at Closing (including the Person to whom such
Company Transaction Costs are payable) (the

  



        
   

  



  

" _Allocation Schedule_ "). For purposes of the Allocation Schedule,
the portion of the Closing Date Consideration payable in respect of each
share of Company Stock shall be determined as if the "fair value" of the
Dissenting Shares were equal to the portion of the Merger Consideration that
would have been paid to the Dissenting Shareholders in connection with
Closing in respect of such shares if the holders of such shares did not
constitute Dissenting Shareholders.

  



  

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, Parent shall (i) pay, or cause to be paid, an amount equal to the
Closing Date Consideration _less_ an amount equal to the Stock Consideration
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
the Shareholder Representative at least three (3) Business Days prior
to Closing for the benefit of the Shareholders, (ii) pay, or cause to
be paid, the Dissenting Shareholder Payment Amount (if any) by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Company for
payment to any Dissenting Shareholder in accordance with Section 2.10, (iii)
pay, or cause to be paid, the Company Transaction Costs to an account (or
accounts) designated by the Company for payment to the applicable Persons set
forth in the Allocation Schedule, (iv) pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of
the Company, the Company Debt Amount to be repaid to the party or parties
entitled thereto pursuant to the Payoff Letters; (v) issue and deliver
the certificates representing the Stock Consideration to the Company for
the benefit of the Executive Shareholders entitled to receive the same, and
(vi) deposit the Escrow Amount and the Shareholder Representative Fund with
the Escrow Agent as set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(d) Subject to Section 2.13(b), on the Escrow Release Date, the Escrow Agent
shall release the remaining balance of the Escrow Amount to the Shareholder
Representative, for and on behalf of the Shareholders, to be distributed as
set forth in Schedule X (the amount paid to a Shareholder under this
subsection (d), the " _Per Share Escrow Portion_ ").

  



  

(e) On the later of (i) the Business Day immediately following the eighteen
month anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the Business Day immediately
following the final resolution of all Pending Claims, if the balance of the
Shareholder Representative Fund is in excess of $250,000, the Shareholder
Representative shall promptly give notice to the Escrow Agent directing the
Escrow Agent to release the portion of the balance of the Shareholder
Representative Fund that is in excess of $250,000, and the Shareholder
Representative shall promptly distribute such amount to the Shareholders. In
addition, at such time as the Earn Out Period has passed, all Gross Margin
Dispute Notices (if any) have been resolved and all Pending Claims (if any)
have been resolved, the Shareholder Representative shall promptly give notice
to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to release the balance of the
Shareholder Representative Fund, and the Shareholder Representative shall
promptly distribute such amount to the Shareholders.  In each case, the
funds released from the Shareholder Representative Fund and paid to the
Shareholders shall be distributed as set forth in Schedule X (the amounts
paid to a Shareholder under this subsection (e), the " _Per Share Shareholder
Representative Fund Portion_ "):

  



  

Section 2.09 _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) _Surrender Procedures_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of
a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Stock (the " _Certificates_ "), (i)
a letter of transmittal (including an appropriate IRS form W-9 or W-8) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration (collectively, the "
_Transmittal Instructions_ "). The Transmittal Instructions shall be in a
form and substance acceptable to Parent and the Company. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Company together with such Transmittal
Instructions, properly completed and duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor their share of
the Merger

  



        
   

  



  

Consideration and the Stock Consideration (if any) as specified in the
Allocation Schedule and as provided for in Section 2.08 (less any amounts
paid to Parent pursuant to Section 2.13 or to the Shareholder Representative
pursuant to Section 5.07). No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash
payable upon the surrender of a Certificate. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Stock is
presented to the Company, accompanied by all documents required to evidence
and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer
Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.09(a), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration or the right to demand to be paid the "fair value" of the
shares represented thereby (plus accrued interest, if required under Section
23B.13 of the WBCA) as contemplated by Section 2.10.

  



  

(b) _No Further Rights in the Company Stock_. As of the Effective Time,
all Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, except for the right to receive (i)
the consideration provided under this Agreement and (ii) in the case
of Company Stock on the relevant record date, any dividend or other
distribution with respect to Company Stock with a record date occurring prior
to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
that remains undistributed to the former holders of the Company Stock for
twelve (12) consecutive months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Company Stock who have not
theretofore complied with this Section 2.09 shall thereafter look only to
Parent and the Surviving Company to claim the Merger Consideration owed to
them hereunder, without interest thereon.

  



  

(d) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be liable to any holder of Company
Stock for any cash or other payment delivered to a Governmental Authority
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



  

(e) _Withholding Rights_.

  



  

(i) Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and the Shareholder
Representative shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the Shareholder Representative
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other provision of applicable Law, and Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Company or the Shareholder Representative shall timely pay
over such withheld amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authority.  Any
amounts so withheld shall be treated as paid to such Person for all purposes
of this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, amounts payable to holders of Company
Options in accordance with Schedule X, Section 2.08, Section 2.11, Section
2.14 and Section 2.15 shall be paid to a special distribution account at the
Surviving Companys then designated payroll service, which shall distribute
such amounts (less any applicable deductions and withholdings) to the persons
who are or were the holders of Company Options as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Surviving Company shall be responsible for the proper
reporting to the appropriate Taxing Authority and such holders of
compensation arising from the payment of such amounts (and the amount of
any Stock Consideration paid to any such holders) contemplated herein. The
Shareholder Representative, the Company, the

  



        
   

  



  

Surviving Company and Parent shall cooperate fully and in good faith, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other parties to further the intent
of this Section 2.09(e)(ii).

  



  

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificate_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if requested by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, the Company will pay, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Company Stock represented by such Certificate.

  



  

Section 2.10 _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if any Dissenting Shareholder shall demand to be paid the
"fair value" of its Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 23B.13 of
the WBCA, such Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or exchangeable
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (except as provided in this
Section 2.10) and shall entitle such Dissenting Shareholder only to payment
of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares (plus accrued interest, if
required under Section 23B.13 of the WBCA), in accordance with Section 23B.13
of the WBCA, unless and until such Dissenting Shareholder withdraws or
effectively loses the right to dissent. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for payment of
fair value of Dissenting Shares prior to the Effective Time. The Company
shall give Parent notice thereof prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall
have the right to participate at its own expense in all negotiations and
Proceedings with respect to any such demands. If any Dissenting
Shareholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent,
then as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event,
the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder shall be cancelled
and converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.08, the Company shall forward to the
Shareholder Representative for distribution to the Dissenting Shareholder the
portion of the Dissenting Shareholder Payment Amounts allocable to such
Dissenting Shareholder in respect of such Dissenting Shares, and such
Dissenting Shareholder shall be considered to be a "Shareholder" hereunder.

  



  

Section 2.11 _Company Options and Company Warrants_. ** **At or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary (including any
necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Companys Board of
Directors or a committee thereof) such that at the Effective Time, each
Company Option and each Company Warrant, whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall be subject to the
provisions of this Section 2.11 without limitation.  In addition to the
foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate all
equity incentive plans of the Company, effective not later than immediately
prior to, and subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Time. Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option and each Company Warrant,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior thereto shall become fully vested and exercisable.
Immediately following the Effective Time, all outstanding Company Options and
Company Warrants that have not been exercised as of the Effective Time shall
cease to be exercisable and shall automatically be terminated and retired
without any further action of the Company, Parent or the Surviving Company,
and each holder of any such Company Option or Company Warrant shall cease to
have any right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
consideration set forth in Schedule X, subject to the withholding rights
provision in Section 2.09(e).

  



  

Section 2.12 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be
no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect
to such shares of Company Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by
Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates

  



        
   

  



  

presented to the Company or Parent for any reason shall be converted into a
portion of the Merger Consideration except as otherwise provided herein or by
Law.

  



  

Section 2.13 _Escrow_.

  



  

(a) The Escrow Amount shall be used to satisfy (i) Losses, if any, for which
any Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification or reimbursement
in accordance with Article IX hereof; (ii) payments, if any, made by the
Surviving Corporation to all Dissenting Shareholders pursuant to Section
2.10, but only to the extent that such payments, in aggregate, exceed the
Dissenting Shareholder Payment Amount; and (iii) the amount of any post-
Closing adjustments owed by the Shareholders pursuant to Section 2.14.

  



  

(b) Subject to Article IX, the Escrow Agent shall release the remaining
balance of the Escrow Amount to the Shareholder Representative (for payment
to the Shareholders in accordance with Section 2.08(d)) on the first Business
Day which is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the " _Escrow
Release Date_ "); _provided_ that if on the Escrow Release Date any claim by
any Parent Indemnified Party has been made that could result in Losses and
Parent has notified the Shareholder Representative of such claim in writing
(a " _Pending Claim_ "), then there shall be withheld from the distribution
to the Shareholder Representative an amount of the Escrow Amount necessary to
cover all Losses potentially resulting from all such Pending Claims until
final resolution of each such Pending Claim in accordance with Article IX
hereof.

  



  

Section 2.14 _Working Capital Adjustments_.

  



  

(a) _Estimated Working Capital Statement_. Not less than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and
deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a statement (the " _Estimated Net Working
Capital Statement_ ") executed by the Companys Chief Executive Officer
setting forth an estimate, as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
of the Working Capital of the Company (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_
"). The Estimated Net Working Capital Statement shall be based upon the books
and records of the Company, shall include a balance sheet of the Company as
of the Closing Date, and shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on
a consistent basis consistent with the methodologies, practices, principles
and estimates used in the preparation of the Company Financial Statements, to
the extent applicable, and in a manner consistent with the example
calculation as of June 30, 2010 set forth in _Exhibit G_.

  



  

(b) _Closing Date Adjustment_. If the Estimated Net Working Capital is
less than Target Net Working Capital, then the Closing Date Consideration to
be paid at Closing will be reduced (on a dollar for dollar basis) by an
amount equal to such shortfall (such amount, the " _Estimated Negative Net
Working Capital Adjustment_ "). If the Estimated Net Working Capital is
greater than the Target Net Working Capital, then the Closing Date
Consideration to be paid at Closing will be increased (on a dollar for dollar
basis) by an amount equal to such excess (such amount, the "
_Estimated Positive Net Working Capital Adjustment_ ").  If the Estimated
Net Working Capital is equal to the Target Net Working Capital, then the
Closing Date Consideration will not be adjusted pursuant to this Section
2.14(b). The Closing Date Consideration to be paid at Closing, as determined
after the adjustments made in this Section 2.14(b), is referred to herein as
the " _Estimated Closing Date Consideration_."

  



  

(c) As promptly as practicable (but in no event later than seventy-five (75)
days after the Closing Date), Parent shall deliver to the Shareholder
Representative a statement (the " _Closing Date Statement_ ") setting forth a
calculation, with reasonable supporting detail, of the Net Working Capital of
the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the " _Final Net
Working Capital_ "). The Final Net Working Capital shall be based upon the
books and records of the Company, shall include a

  



        
   

  



  

balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date, and shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis consistent with the
methodologies, practices, principles and estimates used in the preparation of
the Company Financial Statements, to the extent applicable, and in a manner
consistent with the example calculation as of June 30, 2010 set forth in
_Exhibit G_.

  



  

(d) Until such time as the calculation of the amounts shown on the Closing
Date Statement are final, binding and conclusive on the parties in accordance
with this Section 2.14, the Shareholder Representative and its accountants
shall be permitted to discuss with Parent and the Surviving Company and their
respective accountants (with such accountants consent) the proposed Closing
Date Statement, and shall be provided copies of, and have access upon
reasonable notice at all reasonable times during normal business hours to,
the work papers (provided the Shareholder Representative has delivered a
release satisfactory to the accounting firm which prepared the working papers
if so requested by such accounting firm) and supporting records of Parent and
the Surviving Company so as to allow the Shareholder Representative and its
accountants to become informed concerning all matters relating to the
preparation of the Closing Date Statement and the accounting procedures,
methodologies, tests and approaches being used in connection therewith.
If the Shareholder Representative has any objections to the Closing Date
Statement as prepared by Parent, the Shareholder Representative shall, within
thirty (30) days after the Shareholder Representatives receipt of the
Closing Date Statement (the " _Notice Period_ "), give written notice (the "
_Notice_ ") to Parent, and to the extent practicable based on the information
available, specifying in reasonable detail such objections and the basis
therefor. If the Shareholder Representative does not deliver the Notice
within such thirty (30) day period, Parents determinations on the Closing
Date Statement shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Company,
Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders) and Parent. If the
Shareholder Representative provides a Notice within such thirty (30) day
period, then (i) any amounts on the Closing Date Statement not objected to in
the Notice shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Company, Shareholder
Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders) and Parent and (ii) the
Shareholder Representative and Parent shall negotiate during the thirty (30)
day period (the " _Resolution Period_ ") after the date of Parents receipt
of the Notice to resolve any disputes regarding the amounts set forth in
the Notice. If the Shareholder Representative and Parent are unable to
resolve all such disputes within the Resolution Period, then within five (5)
Business Days after the expiration of the Resolution Period, all unresolved
disputes shall be submitted to an independent accounting firm mutually
satisfactory to Parent and the Shareholder Representative (the " _Neutral
Accountant_ "), who shall be engaged to provide a final, binding and
conclusive resolution of all unresolved disputes within thirty (30) Business
Days after such engagement. Within ten (10) days after the Neutral Accountant
is appointed, Parent shall forward a copy of the Closing Date Statement to
the Neutral Accountant, and the Shareholder Representative shall forward a
copy of the Notice, as well as, in each case, any relevant
supporting documentation. The Neutral Accountants role shall be limited to
resolving such objections. In resolving such objections, the
Neutral Accountant shall apply the provisions of this Agreement
concerning determination of the Closing Date Statement.  The Neutral
Accountant shall promptly provide written notice of its resolution of such
objections to Parent and Shareholder Representative and the resulting
adjustments shall be deemed finally determined for purposes of Section 2.14.
The Neutral Accountant shall be instructed to use reasonable efforts to
perform its services within thirty (30) days of submission of the
statement(s) and objection(s) to it and, in any case, as soon as practicable
after such submission. In resolving any disputed item, the
Neutral Accountant: (x) shall limit its review to matters specifically set
forth in the Notice as a disputed item, (y) shall further limit its review to
whether the Closing Date Statement is mathematically accurate and has been
prepared in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (z) shall not
assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either party. If the Neutral Accountant selected as described above is
unable or unwilling to act when called upon pursuant to this Section, then
the parties shall promptly appoint a substitute to act in substitution for
the original designee (or if no substitute is so appointed within fifteen
(15) days, then such dispute shall be resolved by a single arbitrator,
sitting in Seattle,

  



        
   

  



  

Washington, appointed by the American Arbitration Association upon
application by the parties), and, upon acceptance of such appointment, such
substitute, or arbitrator so appointed, shall, for purposes of this
Agreement, be deemed to be the Neutral Accountant, as applicable, and the
time periods prescribed above in this Section 2.14(d) shall run from the date
of such substitutes or arbitrators acceptance of appointment hereunder. The
fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall be borne by the parties in
proportion to the amounts by which their proposals differed from the Neutral
Accountants final determination. In connection with the resolution of
any dispute, each party (the Shareholder Representative on one hand and
Parent on the other) shall pay its own fees and expenses (provided that the
Shareholder Representative shall have the right to be reimbursed or advanced
such fees and expenses from the Shareholder Representative Fund as provided
in Section 5.07), including without limitation, legal, accounting and
consultant fees and expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, any disputes regarding amounts shown in the Closing Date
Statement shall be resolved as set forth in this Section 2.14(d).

  



  

(e) Within three (3) Business Days after the Final Net Working Capital is
finally determined pursuant to Section 2.14(d) the Parent and Shareholder
Representative shall determine the amount by which the Closing Date
Consideration would have been adjusted pursuant to Section 2.14(b) had the
Final Net Working Capital been substituted for the Estimated Net
Working Capital as of Closing.

  



  

(i) If such substitution would have resulted in a Closing Date Consideration
that is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Consideration (such
difference the "Excess Amount"), then Parent shall pay or cause to be paid
within five (5) Business Days from the date on which the Final Net Working
Capital is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.14(d), by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, such Excess Amount to an account designated
by the Shareholder Representative, for and on behalf of the Shareholders, and
the Shareholder Representative shall distribute such amount to the
Shareholders in accordance with the terms of Section 2.07 of this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) If such substitutions would have resulted in a Closing Date
Consideration that is less than the Estimated Closing Date Consideration,
then the Parent shall have the right to recover from the Escrow Amount an
amount equal to such shortfall.

  



  

(iii) If such substitutions would have resulted in a Closing Date
Consideration equal to the Estimated Closing Date Consideration, there will
be no adjustment to the Closing Date Consideration pursuant to this Section
2.14(e).

  



  

(f) If the Escrow Amount is insufficient to cover all amounts due to Parent
pursuant to this Section 2.14, then Parent shall be entitled to recover the
deficiency (i) first, by offset against any Aggregate Milestone Amounts
actually earned but not yet paid (such earned amount, the " _Unpaid Earned
Earn-Out Consideration_ ") and (ii) second, after recovery has been made by
complete offset against any Unpaid Earned Earn-Out Consideration, the
Shareholders (severally, and not jointly) in accordance with the provisions
of Section 9.02(c). Any amounts due from the Escrow Amount, the Aggregate
Milestone Amounts (if any) or from the Shareholders pursuant to this Section
2.14 shall not be subject to any of the limitations or other procedures set
forth in Article IX other than Section 9.02(b)(iii) and Section 9.02(c).

  



  

Section 2.15 _Earn-Out Consideration_. In addition to the Closing
Date Consideration, the Shareholders shall be entitled to additional
consideration as follows in this Section 2.15 (the " _Earn-Out Consideration_
"):

  



  

(a) The final day of the second consecutive month (if any) during the Earn
Out Period that each of the following are achieved (i) the Companys Caller
Name ID Product has been launched and has at least one (1) active Subscriber,
(ii) the Companys Monthly Gross Margin equals or

  



        
   

  



  

exceeds $2,500,000, and (iii) the Company has a positive Net Income
Contribution margin to Parent, shall be the " _$2.5M Milestone Date_."
Within ninety (90) days of the $2.5M Milestone Date, Parent shall pay or
cause to be paid to the Shareholder Representative for distribution to the
Shareholders in accordance with Section 2.15(i) an amount equal to the $2.5M
Milestone Shareholder Amount.

  



  

(b) The final day of the second consecutive month (if any) during the Earn
Out Period that the Companys Monthly Gross Margin equals or exceeds
$5,000,000 shall be the " _$5M Milestone Date_." Within ninety (90) days
of the $5M Milestone Date, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the
Shareholder Representative for distribution to the Shareholders in accordance
with Section 2.15(i) an amount equal to the $5M Milestone Shareholder Amount,
_plus_ , if not otherwise paid prior to or on the $5M Milestone Date, the
$2.5M Milestone Shareholder Amount.

  



  

(c) The final day of the second consecutive month (if any) during the Earn
Out Period that the Companys Monthly Gross Margin equals or exceeds
$7,500,000 shall be the " _$7.5M Milestone Date_." Within ninety (90) days
of the $7.5M Milestone Date, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to
the Shareholder Representative for distribution to the Shareholders in
accordance with Section 2.15(i) an amount equal to the $7.5M
Milestone Shareholder Amount, _plus_ , if not otherwise paid prior to or on
the $7.5M Milestone Date, the $5M Milestone Shareholder Amount and $2.5M
Milestone Shareholder Amount.

  



  

(d) The final day of the second consecutive month (if any) during the Earn
Out Period that the Companys Monthly Gross Margin equals or exceeds
$10,000,000 shall be the " _$10M Milestone Date_." Within ninety (90) days
of the $10M Milestone Date, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to
the Shareholder Representative for distribution to the Shareholders in
accordance with Section 2.15(i) an amount equal to the $10M
Milestone Shareholder Amount, _plus_ , if not otherwise paid prior to or on
the $10M Milestone Date, the $7.5M Milestone Shareholder Amount, $5M
Milestone Shareholder Amount and $2.5M Milestone Shareholder Amount.

  



  

(e) Not later than thirty (30) days after the end of each month during the
Earn Out Period, Parent shall prepare (or cause the Company to prepare) and
deliver to the Shareholder Representative a statement setting forth the
Companys Monthly Gross Margin and, if the $2.5 Million Milestone Date has
not occurred, the Net Income Contribution for the preceding month (the "
_Monthly Statement_ "). Unless the Shareholder Representative disputes
Parents determination of the Monthly Gross Margin and/or Net
Income Contribution in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.15(f),
Parents determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Shareholder Representative and the Shareholders.  Parent shall make
available to Shareholder Representative all books and records maintained by
Parent and the Company as the Shareholder Representative may reasonably
require in order for Shareholder Representative to review and confirm
Parents calculation of the Monthly Gross Margin and Net Income Contribution,
if applicable, as set forth in the Monthly Statement.

  



  

(f) In the event that the Shareholder Representative disputes the calculation
of the Monthly Gross Margin and/or Net Income Contribution, as applicable, in
any given month, the Shareholder Representative shall notify Parent in
writing by delivery of a notice (a " _Gross Margin Dispute Notice_ ") within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Monthly Statement, which Gross Margin
Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
dispute.  If the Parent and the Shareholder Representative cannot mutually
agree upon the calculation of the Monthly Gross Margin and/or Net
Income Contribution, as applicable, within thirty (30) days after delivery of
the Gross Margin Dispute Notice, Parent and the Shareholder Representative
shall engage the Neutral Accountant to resolve such dispute. The Neutral
Accountant shall review the Monthly Statement and, within ten (10) Business
Days of its appointment, shall make any adjustments necessary thereto (based
solely upon the written proposals from the parties with respect to the items
in dispute), and, upon completion of such review,

  



        
   

  



  

such Monthly Statement and the calculation of the Monthly Gross Margin and/or
Net Income Contribution, as applicable, as determined by the Neutral
Accountant shall be binding upon the parties. If such a review is conducted,
then the party (i.e., Parent, on the one hand, or the Shareholders, on the
other hand) whose last proposed written offer for the settlement of the items
in dispute, taken as a whole, prior to the engagement of the Neutral
Accountant to resolve such dispute was farther away from the final
determination by the Neutral Accountant pursuant to the preceding sentence,
shall pay all fees and expenses associated with such review.

  



  

(g) During the Earn-Out Period, Parent agrees that:

  



  

(i) Parent will maintain (or cause the Company to maintain) separate
accounting of the Company for purposes of determining the Earn-Out
Consideration; provided, however, that the Parent will be permitted to
consolidate health and retirement benefit plans; and

  



  

(ii) any expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be excluded from the
calculation of the Monthly Gross Margin and Net Income Contribution.

  



  

(h) The Shareholder Representative (on behalf of the Shareholders) agrees and
acknowledges that the Parent may make from time to time such business
decisions as it deems appropriate in the conduct of the Companys business,
including actions that may have an impact on the Monthly Gross Margin and Net
Income Contribution and achievement of all or any portion of Earn-Out
Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that during the Earn-Out Period
Parent shall make or cause to be made all business decisions with respect to
the Company in good faith, and not take, or permit to be taken, any action
which has a primary objective of avoiding, circumventing or minimizing the
opportunity to achieve the Earn-Out Consideration hereunder or the ability of
the Shareholder Representative or Shareholders to receive the payment
thereof. No Shareholder shall have any right to claim any lost Earn-Out
Consideration or other damages as a result of such decisions except to the
extent that any such decision shall constitute a violation of Section 2.15(g)
or this Section 2.15(h).

  



  

(i) Subject to Section 2.15(j), the Earn-Out Consideration payable to the
Shareholder Representative pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be paid by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by the Shareholder Representative. The
Shareholder Representative shall distribute any amounts under this Section
2.15 as set forth in Schedule X (the amount paid to a Shareholder under this
subsection (i), the " _Per Share Earn-Out Consideration_ "). Parent may set-
off against all or a portion of any Earn-Out Consideration any amount owed to
(i) Parent under Section 2.14 or (ii) the Parent Indemnified Parties under
the indemnification obligations set forth in Article IX, in each case as, to
the extent and subject to the limitations set forth therein.

  



  

(j) _Subordination of Earn-Out Consideration_.

  



  

(i) _Subordinated Obligations Subordinate to Senior Indebtedness_.  Parent
and the Shareholder Representative, for itself and on behalf of the
Shareholders, hereby agree that (x) all obligations owing by Parent to the
Shareholder Representative and the Shareholders in respect of Earn-
Out Consideration and (y) all obligations of the Parent to the
Shareholder Representative and the Shareholders under this Section 2.15,
including, without limitation, any claims for damages by the Shareholder
Representative and/or the Shareholders against Parent for breach of, or a
default under, this Section 2.15(j) (the obligations under the foregoing
clauses (x) and (y), collectively, the " _Subordinated Obligations_ ") are
and shall be subordinate and junior to the prior payment in full, in cash, of
all Obligations under and as defined in the TNS Credit Agreement (such
Obligations, the " _Senior Indebtedness_ ") until, subject to Section
2.15(j)(iv)(B), Paid In Full.

  



        
   

  



  

(ii) _Events of Subordination_.

  



  

(A) If (x) any Event of Default (as defined in the TNS Credit Agreement)
shall have occurred and until such time as such Event of Default shall have
been waived in writing in accordance with the terms of the TNS Credit
Agreement or (y) an Event of Default (as defined in the TNS Credit Agreement)
would result after giving effect to the payment of any Subordinated
Obligations, then no payment shall be made by or on behalf of Parent for or
on account of any Subordinated Obligations, and neither the Shareholder
Representative nor any Shareholder shall take or receive from Parent,
directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any
other manner, including, without limitation, from or by way of collateral,
payment of all or any of the Subordinated Obligations. Nothing in this
Subsection 2.15(j)(ii)(A) shall be deemed a release or waiver of Parents
obligation to pay the Earn-Out Consideration due pursuant to the terms of
Section 2.15(a) through (d). During any period in which unpaid Earn-Out
Consideration is not permitted to be paid as a result of the first sentence
of this Section 2.15(j)(ii)(A), the unpaid Earn-Out Consideration during such
period shall accrue interest at the rate of eight (8) percent per annum until
Shareholder Representative receives payment in full of the applicable Earn-
Out Consideration, including any such accrued interest. Parent covenants to
use its good faith efforts to, as promptly as practicable, obtain a waiver of
any Event of Default for which it has received notice from the Administrative
Agent under the TNS Credit Agreement (the " _Default Notice_ ") pursuant to
the terms of the TNS Credit Agreement. Parent agrees to promptly deliver to
the Shareholder Representative any Default Notice it so receives.

  



  

(B) In the event of any dissolution, winding up, liquidation, arrangement,
reorganization, adjustment, protection, relief or composition of Parent or
its debts, whether voluntary or involuntary, in any bankruptcy, insolvency,
arrangement, reorganization, receivership, relief or other similar case or
proceeding under any Federal or State bankruptcy or similar law or upon an
assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other related marshalling of
the assets and liabilities of Parent or otherwise (any such occurrence a "
_Bankruptcy Event_ "), Senior Indebtedness shall first be Paid in Full before
the Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to receive any payment of
all or any of the Subordinated Obligations, and any payment or distribution
of any kind (whether in cash, property or securities) that otherwise would be
payable or deliverable upon or with respect to the Subordinated Obligations
in any such Bankruptcy Event shall be paid or delivered directly to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders until the Senior
Indebtedness shall have been Paid in Full.

  



  

(iii) _Enforcement_.

  



  

(A) Subject to Section 2.15(j)(iii)(B), neither the Shareholder
Representative nor any Shareholder will take any action or assert any claim
with respect to the Earn-Out Consideration at any time in which such Persons
are not otherwise permitted to be paid or to receive Earn-Out Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.15(j)(ii)(A). Without limiting the foregoing, neither
the Shareholder Representative nor any Shareholder will, subject to Section
2.15(j)(iii)(B), assert, collect, enforce or seek to enforce any right or
remedy with respect to the Earn-Out Consideration or any part thereof at any
time during which such Persons are not otherwise permitted to be paid or to
receive Earn-Out Consideration pursuant to Section 2.15(j)(ii)(A), including,
without limitation, commencing any action or proceeding, exercising any right
of setoff or recoupment or filing or participating in the filing of any
involuntary bankruptcy petition against Parent.

  



  

(B) In the event of any Bankruptcy Event involving Parent, (a) all Senior
Indebtedness first shall be paid in full in cash before any payment of or
with respect to the Earn-Out Consideration shall be made; (b) any payment or
distribution, whether in cash, property or securities which, but for the
terms hereof, otherwise would be payable or deliverable in respect of the
Earn-Out Consideration shall be paid or delivered directly to Administrative
Agent (to be held and/or applied by Administrative Agent in accordance with
the terms of the TNS Credit Agreement) until all Senior Indebtedness is paid
in full, in cash, and Shareholder Representative, on behalf of the
Shareholders, irrevocably authorizes, empowers and directs all receivers,
trustees, liquidators, custodians, conservators and others having authority
in the premises to effect all such payments and distributions,
and Shareholder Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders, also
irrevocably

  



     



  

      
 

  



  

authorizes, empowers and directs Administrative Agent to demand, sue for,
collect and receive every such payment or distribution; (c) Shareholder
Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders, agrees to execute and deliver
to Administrative Agent all such further instruments confirming the
authorization referred to in the foregoing clause (b); (d) Shareholder
Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders, agrees not to initiate or
prosecute or join with any other person to initiate or prosecute any claim,
action or other proceeding challenging the enforceability of the Senior
Indebtedness or any liens and security interests securing the Senior
Indebtedness; (e) Shareholder Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders,
agrees not to object to any use of cash collateral by the Parent under
Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code permitted by the Requisite Lenders or any
borrowing by Parent from the Lenders, or to any grant of a lien or security
interest by any Person in favor of Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders,
under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code; and (f) Shareholder Representative,
on behalf of the Shareholders, agrees to execute, verify, deliver and file
any proofs of claim in respect of the Earn-Out Consideration requested by
Administrative Agent in connection with any proceeding related to such
Bankruptcy Event and hereby irrevocably authorizes, empowers and
appoints Administrative Agent its agent and attorney-in-fact to (i)
execute, verify, deliver and file such proofs of claim upon the failure of
Shareholder Representative promptly to do so (and, in any event, prior to
thirty (30) days before the expiration of the time to file any such proof)
and (ii) vote such claim in any proceeding related to such Bankruptcy Event
upon the failure of Shareholder Representative or Shareholder to do so prior
to fifteen (15) days before the expiration of the time to vote any such
claim; _provided_  that Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to
execute, verify, deliver, file and/or vote any such proof of claim. In the
event that Administrative Agent votes any claim of Shareholder Representative
or any Shareholder in accordance with the authority granted hereby, neither
Shareholder Representative nor any Shareholder shall be entitled to change or
withdraw such vote. The Senior Indebtedness shall continue to be treated as
Senior Indebtedness and the provisions of this Section (j) shall continue
to govern the relative rights and priorities of Administrative Agent and
the Lenders, on the one hand, and Shareholder Representative and
Shareholders, on the other hand, even if all or part of the Senior
Indebtedness or any liens or security interests securing the Senior
Indebtedness are subordinated, set aside, avoided or disallowed in connection
with any such Bankruptcy Event and this Section 2.15(j) shall be reinstated
if at any time any payment of any of the Senior Indebtedness is rescinded or
must otherwise be returned by any holder of Senior Indebtedness or any
representative of such holder.

  



  

(C) If the Shareholder Representative or any Shareholder, in contravention of
the terms of this Section 2.15(j)(iii), shall commence, prosecute
or participate in any suit, action or proceeding against Parent, Parent
may interpose as a defense or plea the provisions of this Section
2.15(j)(iii) and the Administrative Agent may intervene and interpose such
defense or plea in the name of Parent. If the Shareholder Representative or
any Shareholder, in contravention of the terms of this Section
2.15(j)(iii), obtains any cash or other assets as a result of any
administrative, legal or equitable action, the Shareholder Representative, on
behalf of the Shareholders, agrees that the Shareholder Representative and
the Shareholders shall forthwith pay, deliver and assign to the
Administrative Agent, with appropriate endorsements, any such cash for
application to the Senior Indebtedness or any such other assets as collateral
for the Senior Indebtedness. Further, all payments or distributions upon or
with respect to the Subordinated Obligations which are received by
Shareholder Representative or any Shareholder contrary to the provisions of
Section 2.15(j)(ii)(A) shall be received in trust for the benefit of the
Lenders, shall be segregated from other funds and property held by
Shareholder Representative and the Shareholders and shall be forthwith paid
over to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders in the same
form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).

  



  

(iv) _In Furtherance of Subordination_.

  



  

(A) The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to demand specific
performance of the provisions of this Section 2.15(j) at any time when the
Shareholder Representative or any Shareholder shall have failed to comply
with any of the provisions of this Section 2.15(j) applicable to it. The
Shareholder Representative, for itself and on behalf of the Shareholders,
hereby irrevocably waives any defense based on the adequacy of a remedy at
law, which

  



  



        
   

  



  

might be asserted as a bar to such remedy of specific performance.

  



  

(B) The provisions of this Section 2.15(j) shall continue to be effective
or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of
the Senior Indebtedness is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy
or reorganization of the Parent, any other Credit Party (as defined in the
TNS Credit Agreement) or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been
made.

  



  

(v) _Rights of Subrogation_. No payment or distribution to
the Administrative Agent or the Lenders pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 2.15(j) shall entitle the Shareholder Representative or any
Shareholder to exercise any right of subrogation in respect thereof until the
Senior Indebtedness shall have been Paid in Full.

  



  

(vi) _Waiver of Acceptance_. The Shareholder Representative, for itself and
on behalf of the Shareholders, and Parent each hereby waives
promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other notice with respect
to any of the Senior Indebtedness and any requirement that the Administrative
Agent or any Lender protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest
or lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any
action against Parent or any other Person or any collateral.

  



  

(vii) _No Waiver; Remedies; Amendments_.

  



  

(A) No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right
hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law. The Shareholder
Representative, for itself and on behalf of the Shareholders, agrees that the
terms and provisions of this Section 2.15(j) may not be amended,
supplemented, waived or otherwise modified without the written consent of the
Administrative Agent and the Requisite Lenders (as defined in the Credit
Agreement).

  



  

(B) The provisions of this Section 2.15(j) constitute a continuing
agreement and shall (i) notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement,
remain in full force and effect until the Senior Indebtedness is Paid in
Full, (ii) be binding upon the Shareholder Representative, the Shareholders,
Parent and their respective successors and assigns, and (iii) inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders,
Parent, the Shareholder Representative and their respective successors,
transferees and assigns.

  



  

(viii) _Actions with Respect to Senior Indebtedness_. The Shareholder
Representative agrees and consents, on behalf of the Shareholders, that
without notice to or assent by the Shareholder Representative or any
Shareholder, and without affecting the liabilities and obligations of the
Parent and the rights and benefits of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness
set forth in this Section 2.15(j):

  



  

(A) the obligations and liabilities of Parent and any other party or parties
for or upon the Senior Indebtedness may, from time to time, be renewed,
refinanced, extended, modified, amended, restated, increased, compromised,
supplemented, terminated, waived or released;

  



  

(B) the holders of Senior Indebtedness may exercise or refrain from
exercising any right, remedy or power granted by or available under
applicable law in connection with any agreements relating to the Senior
Indebtedness including, without limitation, any rights with respect to the
Collateral (as defined in the TNS Credit Agreement); and

  



  

(C) any Collateral, including, without limitation, any balance or balances of
funds with any holder of Senior Indebtedness at any time outstanding to the
credit of Parent

  



        
   

  



  

may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be surrendered or released,

  



  

all as the holders of any Senior Indebtedness may deem advisable, and all
without impairing, abridging, diminishing, releasing or affecting the
subordination of the Earn-Out Consideration hereunder to the Senior
Indebtedness.

  



  

Section 2.16 _Retention Bonus Plan_.

  



  

(a) In addition to the Closing Date Consideration and the Earn-Out

Company and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (other than filing of the Articles of Merger
pursuant to the WBCA).

  



  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (i) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the Companys organizational
documents, or (ii) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or

Section 3.10 _Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each of the
following arrangements sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company
or with respect to which the Company has any liability or obligation, whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise due or to become due:  (i) each

each written employment, termination, severance and other employment Contract
or arrangement (each, an " _Employment Arrangement_ "); and (iv) each
"cafeteria plan" or transportation fringe plan governed by Code Section 125
or Code Section 132(f) (each, a " _Flexible Benefit Plan_ "). For purposes of
this Agreement, the ERISA Benefit Plans, the Compensation Plans, the
Employment Arrangements and the Flexible Benefit Plans listed in Section
3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, which shall include any such
arrangements maintained by a third party on behalf of the Company or its
employees, are collectively referred to as the " _Company Benefit Plans_ ").

  



  

(b) (i) The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy
(to the extent applicable) of each Company Benefit Plan (or, if such Company
Benefit Plan is not written, a written summary thereof) as currently in
effect; (ii) each trust or insurance policy relating to each Company Benefit
Plan; (iii) the most recent summary plan description or other written
explanation (if any) of each Company Benefit Plan provided to participants;
(iv) the three most recent annual reports (Form 5500) filed with the U.S.
Department of Labor with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is an
ERISA Benefit Plan for which such a report must be filed; and (v) the most
recent determination letter, if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code.

  



  

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan maintained by or on behalf of the Company or
any of the Company ERISA Affiliates has been maintained in compliance in all
material respects with its terms and the requirements of applicable Law. All
material employer or employee contributions, premiums and expenses to or in
respect of each Company Benefit Plan have been paid in full or, to the extent
not yet due, have been adequately accrued on the applicable financial
statements of the Company in accordance with GAAP. Neither the Company nor
any of the Company ERISA Affiliates has at any time during the five (5)
year period immediately preceding the date hereof maintained, contributed to,
been obligated to contribute to or incurred any liability under any
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or any ERISA
Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code
nor do any of them have any liability with respect to such plans.

  



  

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened Proceedings involving a Company Benefit
Plan (other than routine claims for benefits payable under any such Company
Benefit Plan, appeals of such claims and qualified domestic relations orders)
that would reasonably be expected to result in a material liability of the
Company.

  



  

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan intended by its terms to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code is the subject of an unrevoked favorable
determination letter from the IRS with respect to such Company Benefit Plans
qualified status under the Code, a timely application for such a

  



        
   

  



  

determination letter is now pending or is not yet required to be filed, or
the Company or the Company ERISA Affiliate has duly adopted a prototype or
volume submitter plan document and is relying on the IRS opinion letter for
such document, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each such Company
Benefit Plan is qualified in operation. Except as set forth in Section
3.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of the
Company ERISA Affiliates has any liability or obligation to provide benefits
after termination of employment to any of their employees or any dependent
thereof, other than (i) as required by Section 4980B of the Code or
other applicable Law and for which the covered individual pays the
unsubsidized (under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009)
portion of the cost of coverage, (ii) benefits under any Company Benefit Plan
intended to by qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, (iii)
deferred compensation that is accrued as a current liability on the Interim
Financial Statements, (iv) conversion rights under group insurance contracts,
and (v) benefits provided by any Company ERISA Affiliate to its employees
under circumstances that could not result in liability to the Company.

  



  

(f) There have been no non-exempt "prohibited transactions" (as defined in
Sections 406 of ERISA or 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan that could reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability to the Company. Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any other "fiduciary" (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) has
breached its fiduciary duty under ERISA in connection with the
administration or investment of the assets of any Company Benefit Plan in
such a way as would result in material liability to the Company.

  



  

(g) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by any employee, officer or director of the Company, any
Subsidiary or any of their affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as
such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation
arrangement or Company Benefit Plan would be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code). Section 3.10(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth each
Company Benefit Plan under which, as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in combination with another
event, (x) any current or former employee or officer or other service
provider of the Company or any Subsidiary may become entitled to severance
pay or any other payment, or (y) compensation due any such employee or
officer or other service provider may become vested, increased or the time of
payment thereof may become accelerated (unless such vesting or acceleration
is required by applicable law or by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, Section 5.10).

  



  

(h) Any individual who performs services for the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and who is not treated as an employee for federal income
tax purposes by the Company or its Subsidiaries is not an employee under
applicable Law or for any purpose including, without limitation, for Tax
withholding purposes or Company Benefit Plan purposes.  The Company and its
Subsidiaries have no material liability by reason of an individual who
performs or performed services for the Company or its Subsidiaries in any
capacity being improperly excluded from participating in a Company Benefit
Plan. Each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been properly
classified as "exempt" or "non-exempt" under applicable Law.

  



  

Section 3.11 _Compliance with Laws; Licenses_. The Company has complied with
all applicable Laws, except for such non-compliance as has not had and would
not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has obtained and is in
compliance with all Licenses necessary to conduct its business as presently
conducted (each, a " _Company License_ "), except for any failures to have or
to be in compliance with such Company Licenses that have not had and would
not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 3.12 _Material Contracts_.

  



  

(a) Section 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all of the following
Contracts to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound
(collectively, " _Material Contracts_ "): (i) Contracts for the sale of any
of the assets of the Company (other than in the ordinary course) or for the
grant to any Person of any preferential rights to purchase any of the
Companys assets, in each case in excess of $10,000 individually or $50,000
in the aggregate; (ii) partnership, joint venture and similar Contracts, and
Contracts relating to any investment by the Company in another Person; (iii)
Contracts containing covenants of the Company not to compete in any line of
business or with any Person in any geographical area or that materially
restrict the ability of the Company to conduct business or use any of the
Companys assets in any geographic region or for a particular use; (iv)
Contracts relating to the acquisition by the Company of any operating
business or the capital stock of any other Person; (v) all employment and
consulting Contracts; (vi) each profit sharing, stock option, stock purchase,

(24) hours) with the identity of such Person and a copy of such Takeover
Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where no such copy is
available, a description of such Takeover Proposal, indication, inquiry or

Section 5.04 _Access and Information_. Upon reasonable notice and subject to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreements, the Company shall afford to
Parent and the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives of Parent reasonable access, during normal business hours
during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of the Companys
material properties, books, Contracts, records, employees and agents; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall only be provided to
the extent that such access would not violate applicable Law; and _provided_
_further_  that the foregoing shall not require the Company (i) to permit
any inspection, or to disclose any information, that violates any of the
Companys

  



        
   

  



  

obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third Person to
such inspection or disclosure or (ii) to disclose any privileged information

(b) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable and in accordance
with applicable federal and state Laws and with the Companys
organizational documents, distribute to its shareholders a document with all
information required to be provided to the Companys shareholders regarding
their rights under Section 23B.13 of the WBCA, and a document with all

to the Companys shareholders regarding the resolution of all such comments.
Each of Parent and the Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company all

customary for inclusion in the Shareholder Documents. The information
provided by any party hereto for use in the Shareholder Documents shall be
true and correct in all material respects, at the dates mailed to
shareholders of the Company, without omission of any material fact which is
required to make such information not false or misleading.
No representation, covenant or agreement is made by any party hereto with
respect to information supplied in writing by any other party specifically
for inclusion in the Shareholder Documents.  If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any information relating to the Company, Parent or the Merger
Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by the Company, Parent or the Merger Sub which should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Shareholder Documents, so that the
Shareholder Documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such

this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall notify Parent in
writing promptly after (a) becoming aware of (i) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of the
Company to effect the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied, or (ii) the failure to comply with any
covenant or agreement to be complied with by it pursuant to this Agreement
which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
result in any condition to the obligations of the Company to effect the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to
be satisfied, (b) receiving any notice or other communication from
any Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or other
transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or (c) any
Proceeding is commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
against, relating to or involving the Company which relate to the Merger;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.06 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty
requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this

  



        
   

  



  

Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to
either party, and the failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any
of the conditions set forth in Article VII below; and  _provided_ _further_
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.06 shall not cause
the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII below, to be satisfied
nor shall the delivery of any such notice be deemed an admission that any
condition in Article VII below, is not or will not be satisfied or that there
has been any Company Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 5.07 _Shareholder Representative_.

  



  

(a) _Authority_. Each Securityholder, pursuant to the terms of the
Securityholder Written Consent, has irrevocably appointed or is appointing
the Shareholder Representative as its, his or her true and lawful agent and
attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, on
behalf of such Securityholder on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Section 5.07(a) and the Company shall, in connection with
the delivery of the Shareholder Documents and Transmittal Instructions, seek
to have its Shareholders approve, the appointment of the
Shareholder Representative as their lawful agent and attorney-in-fact to act
on behalf of the Shareholders under this Section 5.07(a). In such capacity,
the Shareholder Representative may take any action on behalf of, and may
bind, any or all Shareholders (to the extent that any such Shareholder shall
have so approved the appointment of the Shareholder Representative) from and
after the date hereof under this Agreement or any other related agreement,
including (i) entering into any amendment or modification hereof or any
waiver of any obligation hereunder; (ii) giving and receiving notices and
communications to or from Parent or Merger Sub relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby (except to the extent that this
Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall
be given or received by a Shareholder individually without reliance on the
Shareholder Representative); (iii) making any claim on behalf of any
Shareholder Indemnified Party (provided that recovery of which shall be made
or directed to such Shareholder Indemnified Party) pursuant to Article IX,
consenting to the payment to any Parent Indemnified Party of any amounts
payable pursuant to Article IX, making any objection to, or determine to
waive or fail to take any action to object to, any claim for indemnification
made by any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to Article IX; (iv) consenting
or agreeing to, negotiate, entering into settlements and compromises of, and
agreeing to arbitration and complying with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to, any claims contemplated by clause (ii) or (iii);
and (v) taking all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Shareholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each
case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Shareholder under
any circumstance. The Shareholders may replace the Person serving as the
Shareholder Representative at any time by written agreement of the
Shareholders holding a majority of the Company Stock (or, if such replacement
occurs after the Effective Time, the Shareholders who held a majority of the
Company Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time), and the
Securityholders shall provide notice thereof to Parent and the
other Shareholders. The Shareholder Representative shall receive no
compensation for its services hereunder, but any out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred, or to be incurred, by the Shareholder Representative in
connection with actions taken by the Shareholder Representative pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (including the hiring of
legal counsel, experts, accountants, consultants or others, and the incurring
of legal fees, other fees and costs) shall be paid from the Shareholder
Representative Fund.  The limitations on liability of the Shareholder
Representative in this Section 5.07 and elsewhere in this Agreement are
material inducements to, and represent consideration in exchange for, the
Shareholder Representative to act as Shareholder Representative under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Shareholder Representative accepts
its appointment hereunder. Parent and its respective Representatives shall
be entitled to rely on the authority of the Shareholder Representative for
actions taken under this Section 6.07(a) and shall have no Liability to the
Company or any Shareholder for such reliance.

  



     



  

      
 

  



  

(b) _Liability_. The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable to any
Shareholder or Securityholder or any other Person for, and the Shareholders
and Securityholders shall severally indemnify and hold harmless the
Shareholder Representative in respect of, all Losses incurred or suffered by
the Shareholder Representative in respect of any act done or omitted
hereunder as the Shareholder Representative while acting in accordance with
the limitations set forth in Section 5.07(a) in the absence of fraud, willful
misconduct or gross negligence on the part of the Shareholder Representative.
For such purposes any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel,
independent public accountant or other professional selected by the
Shareholder Representative shall be conclusive evidence of good faith and the
absence of fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence.

  



  

Section 5.08 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, unless otherwise required by Law,
Parent and Merger Sub agree that the indemnification obligations set forth in
the Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws existing in favor of those
persons who are directors and officers of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (each, a " _Covered Person_ ") for their acts and omissions as
directors and officers thereof prior to the Effective Time, shall survive the
Merger and be observed by the Surviving Company to the fullest extent
permitted under the WBCA for a period of six (6) years from the Effective
Time, and, during such six (6) year period, the Surviving Company shall also
advance the reasonable expenses incurred by any such Covered Person in
connection with the investigation or defense of, or acting as a witness to or
participating in, any claim covered by this Section 5.08 to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, provided the Covered Person provides
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such Covered Person is not entitled to indemnification under this Section
5.08.

  



  

(b) Any Person wishing to claim indemnification under Section 5.08, upon
learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall
promptly notify the Surviving Company thereof, but the failure to so notify
shall not relieve the Surviving Company of any liability it may have to such
Person if such failure does not materially prejudice the Surviving Company.
In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Surviving
Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the Surviving
Company shall not be liable to any Person seeking indemnification under
Section 5.08 for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Person in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if the Surviving Company elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for such Person and advises that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between the Surviving Company and such Person, such
Person may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the Surviving Company
shall pay all reasonable expenses of such counsel for such Person promptly as
statements therefor are received, (ii) such Persons will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter, and (iii) the Surviving Company shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent.

  



  

(c) The Surviving Company shall maintain a policy of officers and directors
liability insurance covering those Persons who, as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, are covered by the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance policy (the " _Insured Parties_ ") for acts and omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time with coverage in amount and scope at
least as favorable as the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance coverage for a period of three (3) years after the
Effective Time.

  



  

(d) If the Surviving Company or any of their successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then and in each such case, proper

  



        
   

  



  

provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of  the
Surviving Company shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.08.

  



  

(e) Each of the Covered Persons is an intended third-party beneficiary of
this Section 5.08 and shall have the right to seek enforcement of the
provisions set forth in this Section 5.08.

  



  

Section 5.09 _Sections 280G Approval_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will (a) submit to all Persons entitled to vote (within the meaning
of the Treasury Regulations under Code Section 280G) the material
facts concerning all payments and benefits that, in the absence of
shareholder approval of such payments and benefits, would be "parachute
payments" within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2) (either alone or
in conjunction with any other event) (collectively, " _Section 280G
Payments_"), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and its
counsel, which will satisfy all requirements of Code Section 280G(b)(5)(B),
and (b) solicit the consent of all Persons entitled to vote (within
the meaning of the Treasury Regulations under Code Section 280G) with
respect to the Section 280G Payments.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Termination of 401(k) Plan_. The Company shall, at least one
day prior to the Closing Date, adopt written resolutions (or take other
necessary and appropriate action) to terminate, the Cequint Inc. 401(k) Plan
(the "Company 401(k) Plan") and to one hundred percent (100%) vest all
participants under the Company 401(k) Plan, such termination and vesting to
be effective no later than the day preceding the Closing Date; provided,
however, that such Company 401(k) Plan vesting and termination may be
made contingent upon the Closing occurring.  Parent reserves the right to
suspend the distribution of benefits from the Company 401(k) Plan on account
of the Company 401(k) Plans termination (but not on account of reasons that
would otherwise permit distribution under the terms of the Company 401(k)
Plan, e.g., separation from service and hardship) until the receipt of a
favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to the termination
of the Company 401(k) Plan.

  



  

 **Article VI.**

  



  

 **ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

conditions set forth in Section 7.01 and Section 7.03 to be satisfied

the foregoing, the Company (with the assistance of Parent, as reasonably
requested) shall act diligently and reasonably to secure, before the Closing
Date, all Consents required under Material Contracts to which the Company is
a party or by which it is bound (collectively, " _Company Consents_ ");
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to incur
(unless indemnified by Parent) any financial or other obligation in
connection therewith (other than normal and customary transaction costs and
filing fees not otherwise required hereby to be incurred by the Company).

  



  

Section 6.02 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent as relates to the Company, or vice
versa, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other
partys or its Subsidiarys operations prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

Section 6.03 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,

and other fees and charges (including any

  



        
   

  



  

penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the consummation of
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Company when
due, and the Company will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns
and other documentation with respect to such Taxes, fees and charges, and if
required by applicable Law, Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to,
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation

Section 6.04 _Confidentiality Agreement_. The Company and Parent acknowledge
and agree that the Non-Disclosure Agreement dated May 21, 2010, between

this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in respect
of such confidential information in accordance with its term.

  



  

Section 6.05 _Public Announcements_. From the date of this Agreement, none
of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, any Securityholder or Shareholder
Representative shall, without the written approval of Parent and the
Shareholder Representative (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), make any press release or other public announcement concerning
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent
that any such party shall be so obligated by applicable Law, in which case
such party shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement and the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to
cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not preclude communications or
disclosures necessary to implement the provisions of this Agreement or to
comply with (a) any disclosure obligations under the Exchange Act or the
rules promulgated thereunder or (b) the applicable rules and listing
standards of any stock exchange.

"moratorium", "business combination", "control share acquisition" or other
form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall become applicable to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement after the
date of this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and member of their
respective boards of directors (or similar governing bodies) shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the

Section 6.07 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Final Tax Returns_. All Tax Returns for the Company that are required
under applicable Law to be filed after Closing, and include a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (each a " _Final Tax Return_ "), will be prepared and timely filed by
the Company. All Final Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with prior Tax Returns of the Company, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law. At least twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date
(giving effect to any extensions) for filing a Final Tax Return, the Company
shall deliver a copy of each such Tax Return to the
Shareholder Representative for its review and approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Shareholder Representative and Parent shall cause to be paid from the Escrow
Amount within five (5) days prior to the due date (giving effect to any
extensions) for filing of such Tax Returns an amount in cash equal to any
Pre-Closing Taxes shown as due thereon to the Company.

  



  

(b) _Refunds_. The Shareholders shall be entitled to all refunds (and any
interest thereon) received by the Company (whether actually or as a credit or
other offset to Taxes payable by the Company, Parent or its Affiliates) after
the Closing with respect to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods excluding

  



        
   

  



  

any refunds resulting from carrybacks of net operating losses or similar
items from Post-Closing Tax Periods to Pre-Closing Tax Periods. If the
Surviving Company, Parent or its Affiliates receive a refund to which
the Shareholders are entitled pursuant to this Section 6.07(b), Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid to the Shareholder Representative (for the
benefit of the Shareholders) the amount to which the Shareholders are
entitled within fifteen (15) days after such refund is received (whether
actually or as a credit or other offset to Taxes payable).  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event any redetermination by a Taxing Authority or
change in applicable law reduces the amount of any refund or credit, which
Parent has paid or caused to be paid to the Shareholders under this Section
6.07(b), the Shareholders shall pay Parent within fifteen (15) days of
Parents request for such payment, the amount of such reduction (together
with any interest and penalties thereon that are required to be paid to the
Taxing Authority in connection with the reduction or credit of such refund).

  



  

(c) _Amended Returns_.  Without the prior written consent of the Shareholder
Representative, Parent shall not amend (or cause or permit to be amended) any
Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax Periods that includes the Company, except
that (i) amended Tax Returns for such periods may be filed to correct
material errors that are discovered in such Tax Returns that, absent such
correction, would materially and adversely affect the Company for Post-
Closing Tax Periods; and (ii) amended Tax Returns for such periods may be
made for the purpose of carrying back net operating losses or similar items
from Post-Closing Tax Periods to Pre-Closing Periods, provided that the
filing of any such amended Tax Return without the consent of the Shareholder
Representative pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) shall not be determinative of
the existence of any claim for indemnification under Article IX or the amount
of any Losses relating to such claim.

  



  

(d) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or
similar agreements with respect to or involving the Company shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company
shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

  



  

(e) _Cooperation_. Parent, the Shareholder Representative and the Company
shall cooperate fully and in good faith, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other parties, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns,
and any audit or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes imposed on any of
them for Taxable periods ending before January 1, 2011. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other partys reasonable request)
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax Return, or any such audit or other Proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Parent, the Shareholder
Representative and the Company agree (i) to retain or cause to be retained
all books and records with respect to Tax matters that are pertinent to the
Company and relate to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by Parent or the Shareholder Representative, any extensions
thereof) of the respective Taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into before the Closing by the Company with any
Taxing Authority, (ii) to provide to the other party, upon any reasonable
request, all books and records with respect to Tax matters that are pertinent
to the Company and relate to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Parent or the Shareholder Representative, any extensions thereof)
of the respective Taxable periods, and (iii) to give the other parties
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if any of the other parties so requests,
the other parties shall allow such requesting party to take possession of
such books and records.

  



  

Section 6.08 _Participation in Parent s 401(k) Plan_. No more than 30 days
after the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates shall permit employees of
Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates who were eligible to
participate in the Company 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Company

  



        
   

  



  

401(k) Plans termination, to participate in a 401(k) plan sponsored or
maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_").
In addition, Parent shall cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to accept direct
rollovers of any eligible rollover distributions, including participant
loans, distributed to employees of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their Affiliates from the Company 401(k) Plan after Closing. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, the Parent 401(k) Plan shall not be required to
accept a direct rollover of any portion of an eligible rollover distribution
that consists of Roth contributions (and related earnings) if the Parent
401(k) Plan does not permit Roth contributions at the time of such rollover.
Parent agrees that the Company may, if it deems appropriate, amend the
Company 401(k) Plan and any policies or documents related to outstanding
loans from the Company 401(k) Plan to participants in the Company 401(k) Plan
to the extent necessary to prevent the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan
(or distribution from the Company 401(k) Plan) from constituting an event of
default under such outstanding loans.

Section 9.02 _Indemnification by the Shareholders_.

  



  

(a) _Indemnification by the Shareholders_. Subject to the other provisions of
this Article IX, from and after the Effective Time, the Shareholders,
severally in proportion with their respective Pro Rata Common Interests
(subject to the terms of Section 9.02 (c)) and not jointly, shall indemnify
and hold harmless Parent and its Subsidiaries (for avoidance of doubt,
including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries), and their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys and consultants and their
successors and assigns (the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any such Parent
Indemnified Parties directly or indirectly as a result of, with respect to,
arising from or in connection with:

  



  

(i) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty
contained in Article III of this Agreement (provided that in each case, after
determining that a misrepresentation or breach of any such representation or
warranty has occurred, the amount of Losses for which Parent Indemnified
Parties shall be indemnified shall be determined without regard to any
materiality or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualification contained
therein);

  



  

(ii) any breach of or any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the
Company to be performed at or prior to Closing set forth in this Agreement;
and

  



  

(iii) all Pre-Closing Taxes.

  



  

(b) _Limitations_.

  



  

(i) The Shareholders shall be required to indemnify and hold harmless
pursuant to Section 9.02(a) with respect to Losses incurred by Parent
Indemnified Parties only to the extent the aggregate Losses exceed seven-
tenths of a percent (0.7%) of the Merger Consideration actually paid to the
Shareholders (the "Basket") on the date such claim is made (the "Claim
Date"), whereupon the Shareholders shall then be liable for all such Losses
that exceed the Basket; provided, that if any additional Merger Consideration
is paid to the Shareholders following the Claim Date that would result in a
increase in the Basket (the date upon which such additional Merger
Consideration is paid, the "Basket Increase Date") (A) the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to recover their Losses incurred as of the Claim
Date for such Losses based upon the Basket calculated as of such Claim Date
(and such Losses shall count towards the aggregate amount of the Basket) and
(B) any Losses incurred after any Basket Increase Date shall be subject to
the increased Basket in effect on the applicable Claim Date that the claim
for such Losses is made.

  



  

(ii) The maximum aggregate liability of all of the Shareholders to all Parent
Indemnified Parties taken together for all Losses pursuant to Section 9.02(a)
shall not exceed the Escrow Amount plus ten percent (10%) of any Aggregate
Milestone Amounts, if any, actually earned during the Earn-Out Period (the
"Indemnification Cap"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent

  



        
   

  



  

that, on any Claim Date, a Parent Indemnified Party incurs a Loss that is
otherwise indemnifiable under Section 9.02(a) that exceeds the
Indemnification Cap (calculated as of such Claim Date) and all or any portion
of the Aggregate Milestone Amounts have not yet been earned, such Parent
Indemnified Party shall be permitted to offset such Loss (to the extent not
otherwise paid) against any future Aggregate Milestone Amounts earned up to
the Indemnification Cap (calculated at the end of the Earn-Out Period).

  



  

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs (i) and (ii), the Basket and
Indemnification Cap shall not apply to claims that relate to a breach or
inaccuracy of the Fundamental Representations or the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.16 or claims under Sections 9.02(a)(ii) or
9.02(a)(iii); provided, that the maximum aggregate amount required to be paid
directly by a Shareholder in respect of indemnification for all claims or
otherwise under this Agreement shall not under any circumstance exceed the
portion of the Merger Consideration actually paid to such Shareholder (with
such Merger Consideration calculated at the end of the Earn-Out Period and
taking into account all Earn-Out Consideration actually paid to the
Shareholders), whether in the form of cash or Parent Shares (valued at the
Closing Date Reference Price).

  



  

(c) _Pro Rata_. In the event that the Shareholders are or become liable
under this Article IX in an amount that exceeds the Indemnification Cap, each
Shareholder shall be liable only for his, her or its _pro rata_  portion of
such amount with such proration determined in proportion to the respective
Pro Rata Common Interests of all Shareholders, subject to the
other limitations set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, that (i)
to the extent the aggregate amount of such liabilities is greater than (A)
an amount equal to the Common Consideration plus the Unpaid Earned Earn-
Out Consideration plus the Paid Earn-Out Consideration but less than (B)
an amount equal to the Common Consideration plus the Unpaid Earned Earn-
Out Consideration plus the Paid Earn-Out Consideration plus the Series
A Preferential Amount, then with respect to such amount each Shareholder
shall be liable only for 100% of his, her or its pro rata portion of such
amount, with such proration determined in proportion to the respective Pro
Rata Common Interests of all Shareholders, subject to the other limitations
set forth in this Agreement, and, to the extent such Shareholder was a holder
of Series A Preferred immediately prior to the Effective Time, to such
Shareholders pro rata portion (with such proration determined in proportion
to the number of shares of Series A Preferred owned by such Shareholder
immediately prior to the Effective Time relative to the total number of
shares of Series A Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time) of the portion of the Series A Preferential Amount necessary to satisfy
the remaining amount of such liabilities in full; and (ii) to the extent the
aggregate amount of such liabilities is greater than (A) an amount equal to
the Common Consideration plus the Unpaid Earned Earn-Out Consideration plus
the Paid Earn-Out Consideration plus the Series A Preferential Amount,
but less than (B) an amount equal to the Common Consideration plus the
Unpaid Earned Earn-Out Consideration plus the Paid Earn-Out Consideration,
each Shareholder shall be liable only for 100% of his, her or its pro rata
portion of such amount, with such proration determined in proportion to the
respective Pro Rata Common Interests of all Shareholders, subject to the
other limitations set forth in this Agreement, and, to the extent such
Shareholder was a holder of Series A Preferred immediately prior to the
Effective Time, to such Shareholders pro rata portion (with such proration
determined in proportion to the number of shares of Series A Preferred owned
by such Shareholder immediately prior to the Effective Time relative to the
total number of shares of Series A Preferred outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time) of the Series A Preferential Amount (if any), and, to the
extent such Shareholder was a holder of Series B Preferred or a warrant
therefor immediately prior to the Effective Time, to such Shareholders pro
rata portion(with such proration determined in proportion to the number of
shares of Series B Preferred owned by such Shareholder immediately prior to
the Effective Time relative to the total number of shares of Series B
Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time) of the portion
of the Series B Preferential Amount necessary to satisfy the remaining amount
of such liabilities in full.

  



     



  

      
 

  



  

(d) _Obligations for Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Shareholders shall indemnify Parent
Indemnified Parties for any amount paid to the holders of the Company Stock
by reason of the exercise of dissenters rights as described in Section 2.10
that is in excess of the amounts set aside for such payments pursuant to
Section 2.08(c) without reduction by reason of the limitations provided in
this Article IX (except for Section 9.02(c) if applicable and for Section
9.02(b)(iii)), and without regard to whether the conditions to the
obligations for indemnification set forth herein have been met.  The
obligations of the Shareholders to indemnity Parent Indemnified Parties
pursuant to this Section 9.02(d) shall be several and not joint, and such
indemnification or reimbursement shall, at Parent Indemnified Partys option,
be satisfied in whole or in part, from either the Escrow Amount or the amount
of any Unpaid Earned Earn-Out Consideration, if any.

  



  

Section 9.03 _Indemnification by Parent_. Subject to the other provisions of
this Article IX, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Shareholders (the " _Shareholder Indemnified Parties_
") from and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any such
Shareholder Indemnified Parties directly or indirectly as a result of, with
respect to, arising from or in connection with: (a) any misrepresentation or
breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in
Article IV of this Agreement (provided that in each case, after determining
that a misrepresentation or breach of any such representation or warranty
has occurred, the amount of Losses for which Shareholder Indemnified Parties
shall be indemnified shall be determined without regard to any
materiality qualification contained therein); or (b) any breach of or any
failure to perform any covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.04 _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

(a) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover more than the
full amount of any Loss incurred by such Indemnified Party under the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of any such Loss.  Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification under Section 9.02 shall be reduced by (i) the amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party (or its related
Persons) incurring such Losses under applicable insurance policies with
respect to claims related to such Losses, (ii) any income Tax-related
benefits that the Indemnified Party (or its related Persons) actually
realized through a reduction of cash income Taxes paid or payable and with
the amount thereof calculated on a "with" versus "without" basis, and (iii)
the amount of any reserves for such Losses set forth on the Closing Date
Statement (as finally determined pursuant to the terms of Section 2.14) and
taken into account in the calculation of the Merger Consideration.  The
Parent Indemnified Parties agree that if coverage of any Losses is or may be
available under any policy held by the Company prior to the Closing, or under
any "claims made policy" held by Parent or the Company, then the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
seek recovery under such policy. To the extent the Shareholders indemnify
any of the Parent Indemnified Parties for Losses hereunder and any of the
Parent Indemnified Parties subsequently collects insurance proceeds or
actually realizes Tax-related benefits with respect to the claim upon which
the Parent Indemnified Partys indemnification was based, Parent shall
reimburse the Shareholders the amount of the Losses for which the
Shareholders indemnified the Parent Indemnified Party within five (5) days of
receipt of such insurance proceeds or actual realization of such Tax-
related benefits (whether as a refund or as a credit or other offset to Taxes
payable).

  



  

(b) The waiver by any party hereto of any conditions set forth in Article
VII will not affect or limit the provisions of this Article IX in any manner.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise payable pursuant to a Third Party Claim,
no Indemnifying Party shall be liable pursuant to Section 9.02 to
any Indemnified Party for any consequential, incidental or punitive Losses or
Losses for lost profits.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) To the extent indemnification of a Loss is required under this Article
IX, no Parent Indemnified Party shall seek payment directly from any
Shareholder or Securityholder for indemnification of any Losses pursuant to
this Article IX unless the Escrow Amount has been entirely depleted and any
Unpaid Earned Earn-Out Consideration has been fully offset.

  



  

(e) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any Losses under
the provisions of this Agreement to the extent any amounts under
indemnification agreements with Persons other than the parties hereto are
received by the Indemnified Party on account of such Losses.

  



  

Section 9.05 _Claims_.

  



  

(a) _Notice of Claim_. Promptly after the receipt by a Parent Indemnified
Party or a Shareholder Indemnified Party, as appropriate (the "
_Indemnified Party_ "), of a notice of any claim, action, suit or proceeding
by any third party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") or upon becoming aware of any
other facts, circumstances or events, in either case that would reasonably
give rise to a right to indemnification pursuant to this Article IX, such
Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such claim to the indemnifying
party hereunder (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), stating the nature and basis
of the claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies
of the relevant documents evidencing the claim and the basis for
indemnification sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of such
indemnification, except if (and then only) to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Thereafter, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices
and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party
relating to the Third Party Claim or such other claim.

  



  

(b) _Assumption of Defense of Third Party Claims_. The Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to assume control of the defense of the Indemnified
Party against any Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and control the defense of
such Third Party Claim (x) if it elects to do so within twenty (20) Business
Days following receipt of the notice with respect thereto and (y) so long
as the Indemnifying Party conducts such defense actively and diligently. The
Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the defense of a Third Party
Claim (or shall not be required to assume control of a Third Party Claim) if
the Third Party Claim of which it seeks to assume control (or has assumed
control) (i) seeks non-monetary relief; (ii) is reasonably determined by the
Indemnified Party after consultation with counsel to the Indemnified Party to
involve a conflict of interest between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim, (iii) involves
criminal or quasi-criminal allegations; (iv) involved a claim which the
Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend; or
(v) involves a claim that is reasonably expected to result in Losses to the
Indemnified Party in excess of 125% of the Indemnifying Partys
indemnification obligation hereunder in light of the limitations set forth in
this Article IX.  The Indemnifying Party shall not, in the defense of such
Third Party Claim, consent to the entry of any judgment (other than a
judgment of dismissal on the merits without costs) or enter into any
settlement without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, unless
(1) there is no finding or admission of any violation of any applicable Law,
(2) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are reimbursed in full
as indemnified Losses and (3) the settlement shall include the giving by the
claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release from all
liability in respect of such claim or litigation. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of the claim, but the Indemnified
Party shall bear the fees and expenses of any counsel retained by it to
participate in its defense unless either of the following apply: (A) the
employment of such counsel has been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying
Party or (B) the Indemnifying Partys legal counsel has advised the
Indemnifying Party in writing, with a copy to the Indemnified Party, that
there is a conflict of interest that would make it inappropriate under
applicable standards of professional conduct to have common counsel.

  



        
   

  



  

If either clause (A) or (B) in the immediately preceding sentence is
applicable, then the Indemnified Party may employ separate counsel at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party to represent the Indemnified Party, but in
no event shall the Indemnifying Party be obligated to pay the reasonable
costs and expenses of more than one such separate counsel for any one Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume control of the
defense of an action contemplated by this Article IX within the manner
contemplated above, or, if control of the defense of such action is assumed
by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party fails to conduct the
defense actively and diligently, (I) the Indemnified Party may defend against
the action in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall consult with the
Indemnifying Party in connection therewith; (II) the Indemnifying Party will
reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the reasonable
costs of defending against the action (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) to the extent such costs are Losses for which the Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification therefor hereunder; and (III)
the Indemnifying Party will remain responsible for any costs the Indemnified
Party may incur resulting from the action to the extent such costs are Losses
for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor hereunder. An Indemnified Party shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, agree to a settlement of a
Third Party Claim, unless the Indemnified Party shall also waive any right to
indemnification under this Agreement in respect of such Third Party Claim.

  



  

Section 9.06 _Payment_. If an Indemnified Party desires to seek
indemnification under this Article IX, the Indemnified Party shall give
reasonably prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party specifying the
facts constituting the basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent
known, of the claim asserted. Until the end of the applicable survival period
specified in Section 9.01, no delay on the part of an Indemnified Party in
giving a notice of claim will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under Article IX unless (and then only to the extent that) the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. Subject to Section 9.01, in the
event that, within the forty-five (45) day period after a notice of claim is
received by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party does not contest
such claim in writing to the Indemnified Party as provided in this Section
9.06, the Indemnifying Party will be conclusively deemed to have consented to
the recovery by the Indemnified Party of the full amount of Loss specified in
the notice in accordance with this Article IX.  If the Indemnifying Party
disputes such claim for indemnification, it shall notify the Indemnified
Party within forty-five (45) days after its receipt of the notice of such
claim for indemnification, whereupon the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall meet and attempt in good faith to resolve their
differences with respect to such claim for indemnification. If the dispute
has not been resolved within thirty (30) days after such parties first met to
attempt a resolution, either the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party
may initiate litigation in accordance with Article X of this Agreement. In
the event that the Indemnifying Party disputes a claim by an Indemnified
Party, then such disputed claim will be resolved by either (i) a written
settlement agreement executed by the Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and
Indemnifying Party, on the other hand, or (ii) in the absence of such a
written settlement agreement, by such litigation. The
Shareholder Representative shall be the Person to receive notices and make
decisions in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 9.06.

  



  

Section 9.07 _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Company, Parent, the
Surviving Entity and the Securityholders agree to treat each indemnification
payment pursuant to this Article IX as an adjustment to the consideration to
be issued pursuant to the Merger for all Tax purposes and shall take no
position contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax Law
pursuant to a determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code.

  



  

Section 9.08 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Except (i) as otherwise provided
below in this Section 9.08, (ii) for any post-Closing payments owed or
made pursuant to Section 2.14 and (iii) with respect to the matters governed
by Section 6.07, the indemnification provided for in this Article IX,

  



        
   

  



  

subject to the limitations set forth herein or therein, shall be the
exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any Indemnified Party in
connection with any Losses arising out of or related to the matters set forth
in this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing herein will limit in any way any such Indemnified
Partys (A) remedies in respect of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, or
(B) rights hereunder to injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce its
rights under this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 10.03 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner adverse to either party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

Section 10.05 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents
and instruments referred to in this Agreement) constitutes the entire
agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and is not intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies hereunder.

  



  

Section 10.06 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by

security purposes.

  



         
 

  



  

Section 10.07 _Parties in Interest_.  Subject to Section 10.06, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party
hereto, and except as set forth in Section 5.08 nothing in this Agreement,

right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The
parties hereby (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or
state court sitting in the State of Washington, and (ii) agree not to object
to venue in such courts or to claim that such forum is inconvenient.  Except
as otherwise set forth herein, all rights and remedies existing under this
Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available under applicable Law.

  



  

Section 10.11 _Amendments_. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement

more counterparts and by exchange of original, facsimile and/or Portable

counterparts of such signature pages have been signed by each of the parties
and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that each party need
not sign the same counterpart signature page.

  



  

Section 10.13 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Annexes, such reference will be to an Article
or Section of or Exhibit or Annex to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents contained in this Agreement is for reference
purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.  Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are

have the meanings ascribed

  



        
   

  



  

to them therein.  No provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in favor
of, or against, either of the parties to this Agreement by reason of the
extent to which either such party or its counsel participated in the drafting
thereof or by reason of the extent to which any such provision is
inconsistent with any prior draft hereof, and no rule of strict construction
will be applied against either party hereto. The Company Disclosure Letter,
as well as all Exhibits and the Annex hereto, shall be deemed part of this
Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. This Agreement
will not be interpreted or construed to require either party to take any
action, or fail to take any action, if to do so would violate any applicable
Law. References to the "other party" or "either party" will be deemed to
refer to the Company, Parent or the Merger Sub, as the case may be.
References herein to "ordinary course of business" shall be deemed to include
"in a manner consistent with past practices."

  



  

Section 10.14 _Jury Trial Waiver_. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER
ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT
AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT
AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY AND THAT ANY
PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

  



  

Section 10.15 _Files and Representation_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge
and agree that the documents and papers in the client files of Perkins Coie
LLP (the " _Firm_ ") that relate solely to the Firms representation of the
Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Firm Transaction Documents_ ") will,
upon the Closing, be owned by the shareholders of the Company as of
immediately prior to Effective Time, and shall be held by the Firm for the
benefit of the Shareholder Representative as the agent of such shareholders.
Such Firm Transaction Documents will not be provided to Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or their successors or assigns following the Closing; _provided_
, _however_ , that to the extent that the Surviving Company is required to
indemnify any Covered Person pursuant to Section 5.08, the Firm shall provide
access to all the Firm Transaction Documents reasonably necessary for the
Surviving Company to determine if such Covered Person is entitled to
indemnification under Section 5.08 and, if applicable, defend such Covered
Person. Firm Transaction Documents will include all notes, memoranda and
correspondence between the Firm, the Company and its officers, directors and
other agents regarding this Agreement and the related transactions, and all
attorney work-product in connection with this Agreement and related
transactions, but will exclude corporate and stock records that customarily
are kept in a minute book. After the Closing, the Firm may be requested to
represent the Shareholder Representative or some or all of the
shareholders in connection with post-Closing matters related to this
Agreement and related transactions or other matters unrelated to this
Agreement or the related transactions (the " _Post-Closing Matters_ "). In
representing one or more of Shareholder Representative or the shareholders in
connection with the Post-Closing Matters, certain conflicts of interest may
arise, in that the interests and objectives the Shareholder Representative or
any of the shareholders, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company on the other hand, may diverge on certain issues and may involve
actual or potential conflicts of interest. Each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby consents to the representation, if requested by one or more
of the Shareholder Representative or of any of the Shareholders and agreed to
by the Firm, of one or more of the Shareholder Representative or of any of
the Shareholders by the Firm in connection with the Post-Closing Matters.

  



        
   

  



  

[Signatures follow.]

  



        
   

  



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement and Plan
of Merger to be executed as of the date first written above.
