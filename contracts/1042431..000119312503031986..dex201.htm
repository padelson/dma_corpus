In consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as
follows:



 ARTICLE I



THE MERGER 



1.1 _ The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, at the Effective
Time, Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, the separate
corporate existence of Company shall cease, and Merger Sub shall continue as
the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").



1.2 _ Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger, in such appropriate form as determined by the
parties, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance
with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ")
(the time of such filing (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by
Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "
_Effective Time_ ") as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as
defined below). The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Fenwick and West LLP, located at Silicon Valley Center,
801 California Street, Mountain View, California, at a time and date to be
specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the

the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. 



1.4 _ Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended
in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such Certificate of
Incorporation; _provided, however,_ that at the Effective Time, Article I of
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation is iManage,
Inc."



(b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in
such Bylaws.



1.5 _ Directors and Officers_. The initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or

this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the
following securities:



(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b) and any
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.7(j)), will be canceled and
extinguished and automatically converted (subject to Section 1.6(e)) into the
right to receive (i) 2.0943 (the " _Stock Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") and
(ii) $1.20 in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_
"), upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company
Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7. No fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu
thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section 1.7(e). Company
Common Stock that is Company Restricted Stock (as defined in Section 1.9)
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 1.9. __



(b) _Cancellation of Company-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share
of Company Common Stock held by Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Company or of Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof.



(c) _Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. At the Effective Time,
all options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding under (i)
Companys 1997 Stock Option Plan (the " _Company Stock Option Plan_ ") and
(ii) Companys 2000 Non-Officer Stock Option Plan (the " _Company Non-Officer
Stock Option Plan_ ", and collectively with the Company Stock Option Plan,
the " _Company Stock Option Plans_ ") shall be assumed by Parent in
accordance with Section 5.10. Rights outstanding under Companys 1999 Employee

(d) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be  



 

2  converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.
Following the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares
of Merger Sub common stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.



(e) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Stock Exchange Ratio, the
Per Share Cash Consideration and the Option Exchange Ratio shall each be
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.



1.7 _ Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. Parent shall select an institution reasonably
acceptable to Company to act as the exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
in the Merger and shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent,
reasonably satisfactory to Company.



(b) _Exchange Fund_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article
I, the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash (such shares of Parent Common
Stock and cash, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares and any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to
as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 and Section
1.7(e) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.



(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (" _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
whose shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common
Stock and cash pursuant to Section 1.6, cash in lieu of any fractional shares
pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant
to Section 1.7(d), (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (that shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares
of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holders of
such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(after aggregating all Certificates surrendered by such holder) into which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(a) (which shall be
in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested
or required by applicable law or regulation), cash, payment in lieu of
fractional shares that such holders have the right to receive pursuant to
Section 1.7(e) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section
1.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until
so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence only the ownership of
the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock and cash into which such
shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted and the right to
receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in
accordance with Section 1.7(e) and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to Section 1.7(d). No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash
payable pursuant to Section 1.6(a), in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock or on any unpaid dividends or distributions payable to
holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of
Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent
Common Stock and cash may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid.



 

3 (d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of
record of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to
applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange
Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, (i)
promptly after such surrender, the amount of any cash payable with respect to
a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after
surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.



(e) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock (that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall,
upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.7(c)),
receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent),
without interest, less the amount of any withholding taxes as contemplated by
Section 1.7(f), which are required to be withheld with respect thereto, equal
to the product of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average closing
sale price of one share of Parent Common Stock for the ten most recent
trading days that Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the trading day one
day prior to the Closing Date, as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market.



(f) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable
Legal Requirement (as defined in Section 2.2(c)). To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid.



(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue and pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder
thereof, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and
cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates were converted pursuant to Section 1.6, cash for fractional
shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d); _provided,
however,_ that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance of such certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock,
cash and other distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.



(h) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor
any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock
or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



(i) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the
provisions of this Section 1.7(i) shall thereafter look only to Parent for
the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section
1.7(e) and any  



 

4  dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to
which they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d), in each case, without
any interest thereon.



(j) _Dissenting Shares_. If holders of shares of Company Common Stock
and Company preferred stock are entitled to appraisal rights pursuant to
Delaware Law in connection with the Merger, any Dissenting Shares will not be
converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock and cash as
provided in Section 1.6(a) and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(e), but will
be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Delaware Law. Company will give Parent prompt notice (and in any case, within
one business day) of any demand received by Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Common Stock or Company preferred stock, and Parent will have the
right to control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand.
Company agrees that, except with Parents prior written consent, it will not
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for appraisal. If any Company stockholder fails to make an
effective demand for payment or otherwise loses his status as a holder of
Dissenting Shares, Parent will, as of the later of the Effective Time or ten
business days from the occurrence of such event, issue and deliver, upon
surrender by such Company stockholder of its Certificate(s), the cash portion
of the consideration, the shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash payment
in lieu of fractional shares, in each case without interest thereon, to which
such Company stockholder would have been entitled to under Section 1.6(a),
subject to the other provisions of this Agreement. " _Dissenting Shares_ "
means any shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time with respect to which dissenters rights to obtain
payment for such dissenting shares in accordance with Delaware Law have been
duly and properly exercised and perfected in connection with the Merger.



1.8 _  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash issued in accordance with the terms
hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.7(d)
and (e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be
no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after the Effective Time
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.



1.9 _ Restricted Stock_. If any shares of Company Common Stock that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are

or repurchased by Company upon any termination of the stockholders
employment, directorship or other relationship with Company (and/or any
affiliate of Company) under the terms of any restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement with Company, then the shares of Parent Common
Stock issued upon the conversion of such shares of Company Common Stock in the
Merger will continue to be unvested and subject to the same repurchase
options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions following the Effective Time,
and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may
accordingly be marked with appropriate legends noting such repurchase
options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions and the cash payable pursuant
to Section 1.6(a) in respect of such shares of Company Restricted Stock shall
only be paid when the shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares
were converted vest in accordance with their terms; in the event such shares
are forfeited or are repurchased, no such cash shall be paid or be payable.
Company shall take all actions that may be necessary to ensure that, from
and after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such
repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement.



1.10 _ Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that
the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368 of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the United States Income Tax Regulations.



 

5 1.11 _ Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Company, any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of Company, any other actions to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform all of its obligations
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by Companys
stockholders as required by Delaware Law (the " _Company Stockholder
Approvals_ "), and (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger pursuant to

Merger, and no other approval of any holder of any securities of Company is
required in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Company and,
assuming the due execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes

Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective material
properties is bound or affected, or (iii) result in any material breach of or
constitute a material default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time
or both would become a material default) under, or materially impair
Companys or any of its subsidiaries rights or alter the rights or
obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a material Encumbrance on any of the material properties or assets
of Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, any material Contract to
which Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which Company or

bound or affected, in each case that is material to Company. Part 2.4(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter lists all consents, waivers and approvals under
any of Companys or any of its subsidiaries Contracts required to be

declaration or filing with any court, administrative agency or commission or

foreign country (" _Necessary Consents_ ") and (iv) such other consents,
orders or authorizations of, filings, approvals, declarations or filings with
any Governmental Entity which if not obtained or made would not reasonably be
likely to materially affect the ability of the parties to consummate the
Merger within the time frame in which the Merger would otherwise be
consummated in the absence of such requirement.

not materially breached any term of such Contracts. The consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will neither violate nor
result in the breach, modification, cancellation, termination, suspension of,
or acceleration of any payments with respect to, any such Contract, or give
any non-Company party to any such Contract the right to do any of the
foregoing. Following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation in the Merger
will be permitted to exercise all of Companys and its subsidiaries rights
under such Contracts to the same extent Company and its subsidiaries would
have been able to had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not
occurred and without the payment of any additional amounts or consideration
other than ongoing fees, royalties or payments which Company or any of its
subsidiaries would otherwise be required to pay.



(m) Neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the assignment to Parent or Merger Sub by operation of
law or otherwise of any Contracts to which Company or any of its subsidiaries
are a party, will result in (i) either Parent or the Merger Sub granting to
any third party any right or license to any material Intellectual Property
owned by, or licensed to, either of them prior to the Closing, (ii) either
Parent or Merger Sub being bound by, or subject to, any non-compete or other

respectively, prior to the Closing.



(n) The operation of the business of Company and its subsidiaries, as
currently conducted, including Companys and its subsidiaries design,
development, manufacture, distribution, reproduction, marketing or sale of
Company Products and services, has not and does not infringe or misappropriate
the Intellectual Property of any third party or constitute unfair competition
or unfair trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to patent applications and patent rights, the
representations in this Section 2.9(n) are made to the knowledge of Company.



(o) Neither Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any written
notice from any third party directly or indirectly alleging, nor to their
knowledge, is there any other assertion or pending threat that their
respective businesses or any Company Products, infringe or misappropriate the
Intellectual Property of any third party or constitutes unfair competition or
unfair trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction, or bringing to the
attention of Company any third partys patents or patent rights with respect
to the Company Products. 



(p) To the knowledge of Company, no person has or is infringing or
misappropriating any material Company Intellectual Property.



(q) No government or university owns any right or interest in any Company
Intellectual Property other than pursuant to licenses granted by Company in
the ordinary course of business or otherwise scheduled anywhere in Part 2.9
of the Company Disclosure Letter.



(r) Company and each of its subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps to
protect Companys and its subsidiaries rights in Companys confidential
information and trade secrets that it wishes to protect, or any trade secrets
or confidential information of third parties provided to Company or any of its
subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Company and its
subsidiaries has and enforces a policy requiring each Employee to execute a
proprietary information/confidentiality agreement substantially in the form
provided to Parent, and all Employees of Company and any of its subsidiaries
have executed such an agreement, except where the failure to do so is not
reasonably expected to be material to Company.



(s) Company and each of its subsidiaries are compliant in all material
respects with all Legal Requirements relating to the collection and use of
personally identifiable information (" _PII_ ") gathered in the course of its
respective operations, and Company and each of its subsidiaries are compliant
in all material respects with the rules, policies and procedures established
by Company from time to time with respect to the foregoing. No claims have
been asserted or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened against Company or
any of its  



 

15  subsidiaries (and to the knowledge of Company, no such claims are likely to
be asserted or threatened against Company or any of its subsidiaries) by
any person or entity alleging a violation of such persons or entitys
privacy, personal or confidentiality rights under any such rules, policies or
procedures. The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein will not materially breach or otherwise
cause any material violation of any terms and conditions of any Contract or
applicable privacy policy of Company expressly governing the collection and
use of PII. To the knowledge of Company, since Companys initial public
offering there has been no unauthorized access to or other misuse of PII.



2.10 _ Compliance with Laws_.

in conflict with, or in default or in violation of any material Legal
Requirement applicable to Company or any of its subsidiaries or by which

properties is bound or affected. To Companys knowledge, no investigation or
review by any Governmental Entity is pending or has been threatened in a

any of its subsidiaries, nor has Company or any of its subsidiaries received a
written communication from any Governmental Entity indicating an intention to
conduct an investigation of Company or any of its subsidiaries. There is no
Legal Requirement binding upon Company or any of its subsidiaries which has
or, to Companys knowledge, could reasonably be expected to have the effect of
prohibiting or materially impairing any material business practice of Company
or any of its subsidiaries in such a way as to be material and adverse to
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any acquisition of material
property by Company or any of its subsidiaries.



(b) Company and its subsidiaries hold, to the extent legally required, all
permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals from

(including items incorporated by reference) required to be filed by Parent
with the SEC since the effective date of the registration statement of
Parents initial public offering, and has made available to Company via EDGAR

necessary registration, maintenance and renewal fees in connection with such

with respect thereto pursuant to which Parent and its subsidiaries either (i)
have obtained sole ownership of, or (ii) have obtained perpetual, non
terminable, exclusive licenses (sufficient for the conduct of its business as
currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted) in and to such Third
Party Parent Product Technology. To the knowledge of Parent, there is no
Third Party Parent Product Technology used by Parent (whether via an
assignment, license, forbearance or other form of grant) and used in any of
Parent Products, such that if the grant is revoked, expires or is terminated,
a substitute could not be obtained from an alternative supplier on
commercially reasonable terms, except where the unavailability of the
substitute would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and its
subsidiaries. To the extent any Intellectual Property incorporated into,
integrated or bundled with, or used by Parent or its subsidiaries in the

originally owned, invented or created by a Parent Employee, (a) all right,

of any Contracts relating to (i) Parent Intellectual Property, (ii) Parent
Licensed Intellectual Property, and (iii) Third Party Parent Product
Technology, and, to the knowledge of Parent, all other parties to
such Contracts have not materially breached any term of such Contracts. The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will neither
violate nor result in the breach, modification, cancellation, termination,
suspension of, or acceleration of any payments with respect to, any such
Contract, or give any non-Parent party to any such Contract the right to do
any of the foregoing. Following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation in
Merger will be permitted to exercise all of Parents and its subsidiaries
rights under such Contracts to the same extent Parent and its subsidiaries
would have been able to had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
not occurred and  



 

28  without the payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than
ongoing fees, royalties or payments which Parent or any of its subsidiaries
would otherwise be required to pay.



(j) Neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this

or Merger Sub being bound by, or subject to, any non-compete or other material

respectively, prior to the Closing.



(k) The operation of the business of Parent and its subsidiaries, as
currently conducted, including Parents and its subsidiaries design,
development, manufacture, distribution, reproduction, marketing or sale of
Parent Products and services, has not and does not infringe or misappropriate

or unfair trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to patent applications and patent rights, the
representations in this Section 3.8(k) are made to the knowledge of Parent.



(l) Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has received any written
notice from any third party directly or indirectly alleging, nor to their
knowledge, is there any other assertion or pending threat that their
respective businesses or any Parent Products, infringes or misappropriates

or unfair trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction, or bringing to

its subsidiaries has and enforces a policy requiring each Employee to execute

provided to Parent, and all Employees of Parent and any of its subsidiaries
have executed such an agreement, except where the failure to do so is not
reasonably expected to be material to Parent.



(p) Parent and each of its subsidiaries are compliant in all material
respects with all Legal Requirements relating to the collection and use of

against Parent or any of its subsidiaries) by any person or entity alleging a
violation of such persons or entitys privacy, personal or confidentiality
rights under any such rules, policies or procedures. The execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein will
not materially breach or otherwise cause any material violation of any terms

of Parent, since Parents initial public offering there has been no
unauthorized access to or other misuse of PII.

impairing any material business practice of Parent or any of its subsidiaries,
or any acquisition of material property by Parent or any of its subsidiaries.



3.10   _Litigation_. There are no claims, suits, actions or proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against, relating to or

expected, either singularly or in the aggregate with all such claims,
actions or proceedings, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
Company that Companys stockholders vote in favor of and approve and adopt
this Agreement and approve the Merger.



(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of Company
from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation in
favor of approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger
and the Board of Directors of Company may, in the case of a Superior Offer
that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to its stockholders,
recommend that its stockholders accept the tender or exchange offer (any of
the foregoing actions, a " _Company Change of Recommendation_ ") if, prior to
the Company Stockholders Meeting, (i) a Superior Offer is made to Company
and is not withdrawn, (ii) Company shall have provided written notice to
Parent no later than twenty-four hours after receiving such Superior Offer (a
" _Notice of Superior Offer_ ") advising Parent that Company has received
a Superior Offer and that it intends (or may intend) to change its
recommendation and the manner and timing in which it intends (or may intend)
to do so, specifying all of the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Offer and identifying the person or entity making such Superior Offer, (iii)
Company shall have provided to Parent a copy of all written materials
delivered to the person or group making the Superior Offer and made available
to Parent all other materials and information made available to the person or
group making the Superior Offer together with a complete list identifying all
such materials and information, (iv) Parent shall not have, within three
business days of Parents receipt of the Notice of Superior Offer, made an
offer that Companys Board of Directors by a majority vote determines in its
good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of national
standing) to be at least as favorable to Companys stockholders as
such Superior Offer (it being agreed that the Board of Directors of Company
shall convene a meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly
following the receipt thereof), (v) the Board of Directors of Company
concludes in good faith, after receipt of advice of its outside counsel,
that, in light of such Superior Offer, the failure of the Board of Directors
of Company to effect a Company Change of Recommendation would reasonably be
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to Companys
stockholders under applicable law and (vi) Company shall not have breached any
of the restrictions set forth in Section 5.4(a), 5.4(b) or this Section 5.2.
Company shall provide Parent with the same amount of prior notice provided
to the members of Companys Board of Directors (but in no event less than
twenty-four hours) of any meeting of Companys Board of Directors at which
Companys Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider any
Acquisition Proposal to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal is a  



 

37  Superior Offer. Nothing contained in this Section 5.2(c) shall limit
Companys obligation to hold and convene the Company Stockholders
Meeting (regardless of whether there shall have been a Company Change of
Recommendation).



For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Offer_ " shall mean, with respect
to a particular company, an unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a
third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination, all or
substantially all of the assets of such party or a majority of the total
outstanding voting securities of such party and as a result of which the
stockholders of such party immediately preceding such transaction would hold
less than 50% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of
such transaction or any direct or indirect parent or subsidiary thereof, on
terms that the Board of Directors of such party has in good faith concluded
(following the receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor), taking into account, among other things, all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the offer and the person making
the offer, to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to such
partys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of
the Merger and is reasonably capable of being consummated.



(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Company or its Board
of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided, however,_ that the Board of Directors of Company shall comply with
Sections 5.2(c) and 5.2(d) prior to taking and disclosing such position.
Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the members of the Board of Directors
of Company from exercising their duties of disclosure and candor under
Delaware Law.



5.3   _Meeting of Parent Stockholders; Board Recommendation_.



(a) Promptly after the date hereof, Parent will take all action necessary in
accordance with Delaware Law and its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
to convene and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting to be held as promptly
as practicable, and in any event (to the extent permissible under applicable
law) within 45 days after the declaration of effectiveness of the Registration
Statement, for the purpose of voting upon the approval and adoption of this
Agreement, the approval of the Merger and approval of the issuance of Parent
Common Stock in connection with the Merger. Subject to Section 5.3(c), Parent
will use all reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies
in favor of the approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger
and will take all other action necessary or advisable to obtain such approvals
and to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of
the Nasdaq Stock Market, Delaware Law and its Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent may adjourn or postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting to
the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to Parents stockholders in advance
of a vote on the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the
Merger and approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with
the Merger or, if as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there
are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Parent Stockholders Meeting. Parent shall ensure that the Parent
Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and
that all proxies solicited by Parent in connection with the Parent
Stockholders Meeting are solicited, in compliance with Delaware Law, its
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market
and all other applicable legal requirements. Parents obligation to call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting in
accordance with this Section 5.3(a) shall not be limited to or otherwise
affected by any withholding, withdrawal, amendment or modification of the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent with respect to the Parent
Stockholder Approvals.



(b) Subject to Section 5.3(c): (i) the Board of Directors of Parent shall
recommend that Parents stockholders vote in favor of the approval and
adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the Merger and approval of the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting; (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include
a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of Parent has
recommended that Parents stockholders vote in favor of the approval and
adoption of this Agreement,  



 

38  the approval of the Merger and approval of the issuance of Parent Common
Stock in connection with the Merger at the Parent Stockholders Meeting;
and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of Parent nor any committee thereof
shall withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Company, the recommendation
of the Board of Directors of Parent that Parents stockholders vote in favor
of and approve and adopt this Agreement, approve of the Merger and approve the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger.



(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of Parent
from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation in
favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the approval of the
Merger and approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with
the Merger and the Board of Directors of Parent may, in the case of a
Superior Offer that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to its
stockholders, may recommend that its stockholders accept the tender or
exchange offer (any of the foregoing actions, a " _Parent Change of
Recommendation_ ") if, prior to the Parent stockholder meeting, (i) a Superior
Offer is made to Parent and is not withdrawn, (ii) the Board of Directors of
Parent concludes in good faith, after receipt of advice of its outside
counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer, the failure of the Board of
Directors of Parent to effect a Parent Change of Recommendation would
reasonably be likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations
to Parents stockholders under applicable law and (iii) Parent shall not have
breached any of the restrictions set forth in Section 5.4(c) or this Section
5.3. Nothing contained in this Section 5.3(c) shall limit Parents obligation
to hold and convene the Parent Stockholders Meeting (regardless of whether
there shall have been a Parent Change of Recommendation).



(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or its Board of
Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided, however,_ that the Board of Directors of Parent shall comply with
Section 5.3(c) prior to taking or disclosing such position. Nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit the members of the Board of Directors of Parent
from exercising their duties of disclosure and candor under Delaware Law.



5.4   _No Solicitation_.



(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, Company and its
subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of their
respective officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any investment
banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by any of them
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, seek, entertain, encourage,
intentionally facilitate, support or induce the making, submission or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or deliver or make
available to any person any non-public information with respect to, or take
any other action to knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions with any person with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, except as to the existence of these
provisions, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v)
enter into any letter of intent or any other Contract contemplating or
otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however,_ that
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approvals, this Section 5.4(a)
shall not prohibit Company from delivering or making available nonpublic
information regarding Company and its subsidiaries to, or entering into
discussions with, any person or group who has submitted (and not withdrawn) to
Company an unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal that the Board
of Directors of Company concludes in good faith (after receipt of advice of
its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of national standing) that
doing so is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Offer if (1) neither
Company nor any representative of Company and its subsidiaries shall
have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4(a) or
5.4(b), (2) the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith, after
receipt of advice of its outside counsel, that the failure of the Board of
Directors of Company to take such action would reasonably be likely to result
in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to Companys stockholders under
applicable law, (3) Company gives Parent written notice no later than twenty-
four hours after receiving such Acquisition Proposal of the identity of such
person or group and all of the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition  



 

39  Proposal and of Companys intention to deliver or make available nonpublic
information to, or enter into discussions with, such person or group,
(4) prior to delivering or making available any such non-public information
to, or entering into any such discussions with, such person or group, Company
receives from such person or group an executed confidentiality agreement
containing terms at least as restrictive with regard to Companys
confidential information as the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in
Section 5.1) and (5) contemporaneously with delivering or making available any
such nonpublic information to such person or group, Company delivers such
non-public information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has
not been previously delivered by Company to Parent and, to the extent
previously delivered, Company delivers a complete list identifying all such
non-public information). The Company and its subsidiaries will immediately
cease any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding two sentences by any officer, director
or employee of Company or any of its subsidiaries or any investment banker,
attorney or other advisor or representative of Company or any of its
subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.4(a) by Company.



For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, with
respect to a particular company, any offer or proposal (other than an offer
or proposal by Parent) relating to, or involving: (A) any acquisition or
purchase from such party by any person or "group" (as defined under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more
than a 10% interest in the total outstanding voting securities of such party
or any of its subsidiaries or any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person or "group" (as defined under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder)
beneficially owning 10% or more of the total outstanding voting securities of
such party or any of its subsidiaries or any merger, consolidation, business
combination or similar transaction involving such party pursuant to which the
stockholders of such party immediately preceding such transaction hold less
than 90% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction; (B) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of
business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of
business), acquisition, or disposition of any material portion of the assets
of such party and its subsidiaries; or (C) any liquidation or dissolution of
such party.



(b) In addition to the obligations of Company set forth in paragraph (a) of
this Section 5.4, Company shall as promptly as practicable and in any event
within twenty-four hours advise Parent orally and in writing of any request
for non-public information which Company reasonably believes may lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with
respect to or which Company reasonably believes may lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the person or group making any such
request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Company will (i) keep Parent
informed as promptly as practicable in all material respects of the status
and details (including any amendments, modifications or proposed amendments
or modifications) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and
(ii) provide to Parent as promptly as practicable a copy of all written and
other materials and information provided to Company in connection with any
such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.



(c) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, without the prior
written consent of Company (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), Parent
and its subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of their
respective officers, directors, affiliates or employees or any investment
banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by any of them
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, seek, entertain, encourage,
intentionally facilitate, support or induce the making, submission or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or deliver or make available to any person any non-
public information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in discussions
with any person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, except as to the
existence of these provisions, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or any other
Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal;
_provided, however_ , that prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder  



 

40  Approval, this Section 5.4(c) shall not prohibit Parent from delivering or
making available non-public information regarding Parent and its subsidiaries
to, or entering into discussions with, any person or group who has submitted
(and not withdrawn) to Parent an unsolicited, written, bona fide Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of Parent concludes in good faith (after
receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national standing) that doing so is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Offer if (1) neither Parent nor any representative of Parent and its
subsidiaries shall have violated any of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.4(c), (2) the Board of Directors of Parent concludes in good faith,
after receipt of advice of its outside counsel, that the failure of the Board
of Directors of Parent to take such action would reasonably be likely to
result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to Parents stockholders under
applicable law and (3) Parent gives Company written notice no later than
twenty-four hours after receiving such Acquisition Proposal of the identity
of such person or group and all of the material terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal and of Parents intention to deliver or make available
nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such person or
group. Parent and its subsidiaries will immediately cease any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in the preceding two sentences by any officer, director or employee of Parent
or any of its subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor
or representative of Parent or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 5.4(c) by Parent.



(d) In addition to the obligations of Parent set forth in paragraph (c) of
this Section 5.4, Parent shall as promptly as practicable and in any event
within twenty-four hours advise Company orally and in writing of any
request for non-public information which Parent reasonably believes may lead
to an Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with
respect to or which Parent reasonably believes may lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the person or group making any such
request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Parent will keep Company informed as
promptly as practicable in all material respects of the status and details
(including any amendments, modifications or proposed amendments or
modifications) of any such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.



5.5   _Confidentiality; Access to Information_.



(a) _Confidentiality Agreement_. The parties acknowledge that Company and
Parent have previously executed the Confidentiality Agreement, which will
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.



(b) _Access to Information_. Company will afford Parent and its
accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours to the properties, books, records and personnel of Company
during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information
concerning the business, properties, results of operations and personnel of
Company, as Parent may reasonably request; _provided, however,_ that Company
may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any law, treaty, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to Company requires Company
to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information. No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this
Section 5.5 will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger.



5.6   _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Company and Parent
will give prompt notice to the other of (i) any notice or other communication
from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be
required in connection with the Merger, (ii) any notice or other communication
from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, (iii) any material
litigation relating to, involving or otherwise affecting Company, Parent or
their respective subsidiaries. Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of
any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of Company to comply with or satisfy in
any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it under this Agreement, _provided, however,_ that no such
notification shall affect the representations,  



 

41  warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement. Parent shall give prompt
notice to Company of any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of
Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement, _provided, however,_ that no such notification shall affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.



5.7   _Public Disclosure_. Parent and Company will consult with each
other, and to the extent reasonably practicable, agree, before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the

national securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market. The parties have
agreed to the text of the joint press release announcing the signing of this
Agreement.



5.8   _Reasonable Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts
necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be
satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and
filings (including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental
Entities, if any) and the taking of all commercially reasonable steps as may
be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by
any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) the defending of any suits,
claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the

temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed and (v) the execution or delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates shall
be under any obligation to effect an Action of Divestiture. 



" _Action of Divestiture_ " means (i) making proposals, executing or carrying
out agreements or submit to Legal Requirements providing for the license, sale
or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust
or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets that are material to
Parent, Company or any of their respective subsidiaries or the holding
separate of Company capital stock, stock of Merger Sub or stock of the
Surviving Corporation, or imposing or seeking to impose any limitation on the
ability of Parent, Company or any of their respective subsidiaries to conduct

stock (or shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation) or (ii) otherwise
taking any step to avoid or eliminate any impediment which may be asserted
under any Legal Requirement governing competition, monopolies or restrictive
trade practices.



5.9   _Third Party Consents_. Parent and Company will each use all
reasonable efforts to obtain, as soon as practicable following the date
hereof, any consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its
subsidiaries respective Contracts required to be obtained in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.



 

42 5.10   _Stock Options; ESPP and Employee Benefits_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, whether or not
then exercisable, will be converted into an option to purchase Parent Common
Stock. Each Company Option so converted will continue to have, and be subject
to, substantially the same terms and conditions, except that (i) each
converted Company Option shall be exercisable (or will become exercisable in
accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii)
the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such converted Company Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. Continuous employment or service with Company or its subsidiaries shall
be credited to the optionee for all purposes, including for purposes of
determining the vesting of all converted Company Options after the Effective
Time. " _Option Exchange Ratio_ " means the sum of (i) the Stock Exchange
Ratio and (ii) the fraction obtained by dividing (x) the Per Share Cash
Consideration by (y) the average closing price of a share of Parent Common
Stock for the five trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the
Closing Date. The conversion of Company Options provided for in this Section
5.10(a) with respect to any Company Options that are intended to be "incentive
stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) shall be effected in a
manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and otherwise in a manner
designed to preserve incentive stock option treatment.



(b) Following the Effective Time, except as set forth in Section 5.10(d),
employees who are continuing employees of Company or the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to participate in the employee
benefit arrangements in which similarly situated Parent employees are
participants. To the extent requested in writing by Parent no later than ten
business days prior to the Closing Date, Company shall take (or cause to be
taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later
than the date immediately preceding the Closing Date, any Company Employee
Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under
Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _401(k) Plans_ ") in accordance with the
provisions of the 401(k) Plans and applicable law. Upon the request of Parent,
Company and its subsidiaries agree that they shall terminate any and all
group severance, separation, retention and salary continuation plans,
programs, agreements or arrangements prior to the Closing Date other than
agreements that by their terms cannot be unilaterally terminated by Company.



(c) With respect to each employee benefit plan, program, practice or policy
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their affiliates (each, a "
_Parent Plan_ "), each continuing employee shall be given credit under such
Parent Plan for all service with Company or any predecessor employer for all
purposes, including for purposes of determining eligibility, participation,
vesting, benefit accrual, benefit levels, severance and vacation accrual and
for all other purposes for which such service is either taken into account
or recognized, except for purposes of benefit accrual under a defined benefit
pension plan or for purposes of new equity awards. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, except for purposes of tax qualified plans, in no event shall
credit be provided to the extent that similarly situated employees of Parent
would not receive such credit. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall give
continuing employees credit under those of its applicable Parent Plans that
are welfare benefit plans and in which continuing employees become eligible
to participate at or following the Effective Time, for all co-payments made,
amounts credited toward deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, and time
accrued against applicable waiting periods, by continuing employees
(including their eligible dependents), in respect of the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.10(c)
is not intended to provide continuing employees with a duplication of
benefits. 



(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company ESPP and each
purchase right then outstanding thereunder shall be converted into a right to
acquire Parent Common Stock with such adjustments as are appropriate to
satisfy the requirements of Section 423 of the Code and other applicable law,
and, to the extent  



 

43  consistent with the foregoing, to preserve the value inherent in such
purchase right with no material detrimental effects on the holders
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company ESPP and all Purchase
Dates under the Company ESPP shall terminate on January 31, 2004 or such later
date as mutually agreed between Parent and Company, at which time continuing
employees shall be eligible to participate in Parents Section 423 plan. With
respect to matters described in this Section 5.10(d), Company will consult
with Parent (and consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending
any material notices or other communication materials to its employees.



5.11   _Form S-8_. Parent agrees to file a registration statement on
Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to
converted Company Options as soon as is reasonably practicable, but in no
event later than ten business days after the Effective Time and shall maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as any of such
converted Company Options remain outstanding.



5.12   _Indemnification_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Company
pursuant to any indemnification Contracts between Company and its directors
and officers as of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") and any
indemnification provisions under Companys Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, in each case, subject to
applicable law. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and
indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Company as
in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees
or agents of Company, unless such modification is required by law.



(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, if available, directors and
officers liability insurance coverage for those persons who are currently
covered by Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy on
terms substantially similar to those applicable to the current directors and
officers of Company; _provided, however_ , that in no event will Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend on an annual basis in excess of
150% of the annual premium currently paid by Company for such coverage (or
such coverage as is available for such 150% of such annual premium).



(c) This Section 5.12 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be
enforceable by the Indemnified Parties.



5.13   _Nasdaq Listing_. Parent agrees to authorize for listing on the
Nasdaq Stock Market the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable, and those
required to be reserved for issuance (including in connection with assumed
Company Options), in connection with the Merger, effective upon official
notice of issuance.



5.14   _Takeover Statutes_.



(a) No party hereto shall take any action that would cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to any Takeover Statute. If any
Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and Company
and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take
such lawful actions as are necessary to ensure that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute and any regulations promulgated thereunder on such transactions.



 

44 5.15   _Section 16 Matters_. Company shall and, provided that Company
delivers to Parent the Section 16 Information (as defined below) in advance of
the meeting of Parents Board of Directors where such matters are scheduled
to be discussed, Parent shall use all reasonable efforts (to the extent
permitted under applicable law) to cause any disposition of Company Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each Company Insider to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act. " _Section 16 Information_ " shall mean
information regarding the Company Insiders, the number of shares of Company
capital stock held by each such Company Insider and expected to be exchanged
for Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger, and the number and
description of the Company Options held by each such Company Insider and

with the Merger. " _Company Insiders_ " shall mean those individuals who are
or will be subject to the reporting requirement of Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act with respect to Parent or Company.



5.16   _Parent Board of Directors_. The Board of Directors of Parent
shall take all actions reasonably necessary, including increasing the size of
the Board of Directors of Parent, such that effective immediately upon the
Closing, Mahmood M. Panjwani and one designee of Company, who is an
independent member of the Board of Directors of Company, acceptable to the
Board of Directors of Parent (each, a " _Company Designee_ ") shall become
members of the Board of Directors of Parent.



5.17   _Tax Treatment as Reorganization_. Neither Parent, Merger Sub
nor Company shall, and they shall not permit any of their respective
subsidiaries to, take any action or cause any action to be taken prior to or
following the Closing that would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to
fail to qualify as a reorganization with the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify.
Parent, Merger Sub and Company shall, and shall cause their respective
subsidiaries to, take the position for all purposes that the Merger qualifies
as a reorganization under that Section of the Code. Parent, Merger Sub and
Company shall, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to, cooperate
and use all reasonable efforts in obtaining the opinions described in Sections
6.2(e) and 6.3(d). Parent, Merger Sub and Company shall, and shall cause their
respective subsidiaries to use all reasonable efforts to provide Skadden,

counsel to render the opinions referred to in the preceding sentences.

obligations) or guarantees by Company or any of its subsidiaries of any third
party indebtedness to be paid in full or otherwise settled, (ii) cause all
agreements relating to such indebtedness (including security agreements) to
be terminated, and (iii) cause all security interests, liens or other
encumbrances securing such indebtedness to be released and shall file all UCC
termination statements necessary to perfect or give notice of the release of
such security interests.

reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, as promptly
as practicable on or following the date hereof, from each person listed on
Part 2.21 of the Company Disclosure Letter, an executed affiliate agreement
pursuant to which such affiliate shall agree to be bound by the provisions of
Rule 145 in a form provided by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company.
Parent will give stop transfer instructions to its transfer agent with respect
to any Parent Common Stock received pursuant to the Merger by any such Company
affiliate, and there will be placed on the certificates representing such
Parent Common Stock, or any substitutions therefor, an appropriate
restrictive legend stating in substance that such shares were issued in a
transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act applies and
that the transferability of such shares is therefore restricted but that such
legend shall be removed by Parent upon receipt of an opinion of counsel that
such legend may be removed.
