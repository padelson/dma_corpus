proposed: (i) that Merger Sub make a cash tender offer to acquire all of the
issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at a price of $11.25 per
share net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon and subject to any
required Tax withholding (such dollar amount, or any greater dollar amount per
share paid pursuant to such cash tender offer, subject to adjustment pursuant

conditions set forth in this Agreement (such cash tender offer, as it may be
amended from time to time in accordance with this Agreement, the "Offer"), and
(ii) that, after acquiring shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer, Merger Sub merge with and into the Company, with the Company being the
surviving corporation, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the Company Board has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and
the Merger, are fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and

Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and, if required by applicable Laws,
approve this Agreement and the Merger; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent has (i) determined that the Merger
is advisable and in the best interests of Parent and its stockholders, and
(ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger; and

  

  

WHEREAS, (i) the board of directors of Merger Sub has determined that the
Merger is advisable and in the best interests of Merger Sub and its sole

and approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger; and

  

  

WHEREAS, immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub
to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (i) certain shareholders of the Company are executing and delivering
to Parent and Merger Sub tender and support agreements (the "Support
Agreements") and (ii) the individuals set forth on Annex II are executing and
delivering to Parent and Merger Sub amended and restated employment
agreements, effective upon the Closing, to, among other things, assist Parent
with transitional matters following the Closing (the "Employment Agreements").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

THE OFFER

  

  

Section 1.1 The Offer.

  

  

(a) Subject to the provisions contained in the following sentence, Merger Sub
shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the
Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement.
If the Company: (i) shall have fully cooperated with Parent in connection with
the Offer and the preparation of the Offer Documents, including by promptly
providing to Parent any comments regarding the Offer Documents from the
Company and its advisors, and (ii) shall be prepared to file with the SEC, and
to disseminate to holders of Company Common Stock, the Schedule 14D-9 on the
date Parent files the Offer Documents with the SEC, then Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, commence the Offer within seven (7)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that Merger
Sub shall not be required to commence the Offer if (w) any of the conditions
set forth in clauses (a), (b), (c), (g), (h), (j), (k), (l) and (n) of Annex I
shall not be satisfied, or (x) the Company shall not be prepared to file
immediately with the SEC, and to disseminate to holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, the Schedule 14D-9 (the date on which Merger Sub commences the
Offer, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Offer Commencement Date"). The obligation of Merger
Sub (and the obligation of Parent to cause Merger Sub) to accept for payment,
and pay for, any shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to
the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction of or (if permitted) waiver of
(y) the condition that there shall be validly tendered (not including any
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to procedures for
guaranteed delivery) and not withdrawn a number of shares of Company Common
Stock that, together with any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent
or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, represents more than
50% of the Adjusted Outstanding Share Number (the "Minimum Condition"), and
(z) the other conditions set forth in Annex I hereto (the Minimum Condition
and the other conditions set forth in Annex I are referred to collectively as
the "Offer Conditions"). For purposes of this Agreement, the "Adjusted
Outstanding Share Number" shall be the sum of: (A) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time, plus (B) an additional number of shares up to (but not
exceeding) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable
upon the conversion, exchange or exercise, as applicable, of all options,
warrants and other rights to acquire, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior
to the Acceptance Time (other than potential (but not actual) dilution
attributable to the Top-Up Option). Subject to the Offer Conditions and the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, and
Merger Sub shall, (1) accept for payment all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer as soon as
practicable after Merger Sub is permitted to do so under applicable Legal
Requirements, and (2) pay the Offer Price in exchange for each share of
Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i)
increase the Offer Price, and (ii) waive any Offer Condition or make any other
changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that
without the prior written consent of the Company, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub may (A) waive or amend the Minimum Condition, (B) change the form of
consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer, (C) decrease the Offer Price or the number of shares of Company
Common Stock sought to be purchased by Merger Sub in the Offer, (D) impose
conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions, or (E) except as
provided in Section 1.1(c), extend the expiration date of the Offer.

  

  

(c) The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire twenty (20) Business Days
following the Offer Commencement Date (determined pursuant to Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) (the "Initial Expiration Date"; such
date or such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the "Expiration Date").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the parties' respective termination rights under Section 8.1: (i)
if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied
and has not been waived, Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion (and without
the consent of the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer on one or
more occasions, for an additional period of up to twenty (20) Business Days
per extension (but no later than the Outside Date), to permit such Offer
Condition to be satisfied, (ii) Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion (and
without the consent of the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer from
time to time for any period required by any Regulation of the SEC applicable
to the Offer, and (iii) Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion (and without
the consent of the Company or any other Person), elect to provide for a
"subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act (unless Parent has become
the owner, directly or indirectly, of 80% or more of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock). Subject to the parties' respective termination rights
under Section 8.1, (A) if: (1) each of the Offer Conditions set forth in
clauses (a), (b), (c), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (m), and (n) of
Annex I is satisfied or has been waived as of the scheduled Expiration Date,
or Merger Sub reasonably determines that all of such Offer Conditions are
likely to be satisfied within fifteen (15) Business Days after such date, and
(2) any of the other Offer Conditions is not satisfied and has not been waived
on such date, then, to the extent requested in writing by the Company no less
than two (2) Business Days prior to such date, Merger Sub shall extend the
Offer beyond such date for an additional period of up to twenty (20) Business
Days, and (B) if each of the Offer Conditions set forth in Annex I is
satisfied or has been waived as of the scheduled Expiration Date, other than
the condition set forth in clause (m), then if such scheduled Expiration Date
is a date prior to the Designated Date, to the extent requested in writing by
the Company no less than two (2) Business Days prior to such scheduled
Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer to the Designated Date or
to such later date as may be required under applicable securities Laws (as
determined by Merger Sub in its reasonable discretion); provided that in the
case of either (A) or (B) in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend
the Offer to a date later than the Outside Date.

(d) On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) cause to
be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (the "Schedule
TO") with respect to the Offer, which will contain or incorporate by reference
(A) Merger Sub's offer to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer (the "Offer to Purchase") and (B) the forms of the related letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO, the Offer to Purchase, and all exhibits, amendments and supplements
thereto, the "Offer Documents"), and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and
related documents to be disseminated to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock. Parent and Merger Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company and its legal counsel
shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents (including all amendments and supplements thereto) prior to filing
thereof with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide the Company
and its legal counsel with a copy of any written comments and a description of
any oral comments received by Parent, Merger Sub or their legal counsel from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company: (1) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents or the Offer and (2) to the extent required by the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents
if and to the extent that such information shall be or shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Sub shall take
all steps reasonably necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as supplemented
or amended to correct such information, to be filed with the SEC, to the
extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, and to be disseminated to
holders of shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall promptly furnish
to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the Company's shareholders that may be required or reasonably
requested by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with any action contemplated
by this Section 1.1(d).

  

  

(e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the date on which any
particular share of Company Common Stock is accepted for payment pursuant to
the Offer, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if
a record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such period,
then the Offer Price shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted.

  

  

Section 1.2 Company Actions.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby approves and consents to the Offer. The Company Board,
at a meeting duly called and held, has unanimously by a vote of all the
directors, (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair,

Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the
requirements of the FBCA, (iii) resolved to recommend that the shareholders of
the Company accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and, if required by applicable Laws, approve this
Agreement and the Merger (such unanimous recommendation, the "Company Board
Recommendation"), and (iv) taken all other actions necessary to exempt the
Offer, the Support Agreements and, to the extent required, this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, from any "fair price," "moratorium,"
"control share acquisition," "interested shareholder," "business combination,"
"affiliated transaction" or other similar Legal Requirement, including
Sections 607.0901 and 607.0902 of the FBCA. Subject to Section 5.3, the

(b) Contemporaneously with the filing by Parent and Merger Sub of the Schedule
TO, the Company shall file with the SEC and (following or contemporaneously
with the dissemination of the Offer to Purchase and related documents)
disseminate to holders of shares of Company Common Stock a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that shall reflect
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the information required by
Section 1.3(c) and, subject only to Section 5.3, shall include the Company
Board Recommendation. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to
the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that may be
required or reasonably requested by the Company in connection with any action
contemplated by this Section 1.2(b). The Company shall cause the Schedule
14D-9 and the filings and dissemination thereof to comply in all material
respects with the Exchange Act and with all applicable Legal Requirements. To
the extent required by the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or by
other Legal Requirements: (i) each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly correct any information
provided by it or on its behalf for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that such information shall be or shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect, and (ii) the Company shall take all steps reasonably
necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as supplemented or amended to correct
such information, to be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Legal Requirements, to be disseminated to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock. Parent and its legal counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any
amendments or supplements thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.
The Company shall promptly provide Parent and its legal counsel with a copy of
any written comments and a description of any oral comments received by the
Company or its legal counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9, and the Company shall respond promptly to such comments.

  

  

(c) The Company shall promptly provide to Parent: (i) a list of the Company's
shareholders, non-objecting beneficial owners, mailing labels and any
available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of shares of Company Common Stock and lists of securities
positions of shares of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, in
each case accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date, and
(ii) such additional information (including updated lists of shareholders,
non-objecting beneficial owners, mailing labels and lists of securities
positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in
connection with the Offer or the Merger.

  

  

Section 1.3 Directors.

  

  

(a) Effective upon the Acceptance Time and from time to time thereafter,
Parent shall be entitled to designate, to serve on the Company Board, the
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, determined by
multiplying: (i) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving
effect to any increase in the size of the Company Board pursuant to this
Section 1.3(a)), by (ii) a fraction having a numerator equal to the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock then beneficially owned by Parent or
Merger Sub (including all shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer), and having a denominator equal to the total number of
shares of Company Common Stock then issued and outstanding (provided that, in
no event shall Parent's director designees constitute less than a majority of
the entire Company Board). The Company shall take all action (including, to
the extent necessary, seeking and accepting the resignations of one or more
incumbent directors and increasing the size of the Company Board) necessary to
cause Parent's designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board (the
date on which a majority of the Company's directors are designees of Parent
that have been effectively appointed to the Company Board in accordance
herewith, the "Board Appointment Date").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) From and after the Acceptance Time, to the extent requested by Parent, the
Company shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) obtain and
deliver to Parent the resignation of each individual who is an officer of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and (ii) cause individuals
designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the
next whole number, on: (A) each committee of the Company Board, and (B) the
board of directors of each Company Subsidiary (and each committee thereof)
that represents at least the same percentage as individuals designated by
Parent represent on the Company Board. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 1.3, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at all
times prior to the Effective Time, to cause at least two of the members of the
Company Board to be individuals who were directors of the Company on the date
of this Agreement ("Continuing Directors"); provided, however, that: (x) if at
any time prior to the Effective Time there shall be only one Continuing
Director serving as a director of the Company for any reason, then the Company
Board shall cause an individual selected by the remaining Continuing Director
to be appointed to serve on the Company Board (and such individual shall be
deemed to be a Continuing Director for all purposes under this Agreement), and
(y) if at any time prior to the Effective Time no Continuing Directors remain
on the Company Board, then the Company Board shall appoint two individuals who
are not officers, employees or Affiliates of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub
to serve on the Company Board (and such individuals shall be deemed to be
Continuing Directors for all purposes under this Agreement).

  

  

(c) In connection with the performance of its obligations to cause Parent's
designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board, the Company shall
promptly take all actions, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors, as
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder require in order
to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3, subject to the Company's
receipt of the information with respect to Parent and its nominees, officers,
directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in addition to,
and shall not limit, any right that Merger Sub, Parent or any Affiliate of
Merger Sub or Parent may have (with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise) under applicable Legal Requirements as a holder or beneficial owner
of shares of Company Common Stock.

  

  

(d) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees to the Company
Board pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of
a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize any of
the following actions of the Company (each, an "Adverse Action"), to the
extent the action in question could reasonably be expected to affect adversely
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or Merger
Sub): (i) any action by the Company with respect to any amendment or waiver of
any term or condition of this Agreement, the Merger or the Company Articles or
Company Bylaws, (ii) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, or
(iii) any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub, or any waiver or
assertion of any of the Company's rights under this Agreement. The approval of
any Adverse Action by a majority of the Continuing Directors shall constitute
the valid authorization of the Company Board with respect to such Adverse
Action, and no other action on the part of the Company or by any other
director of the Company shall be required to authorize such Adverse Action.

Section 1.4 Top-Up Option.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby grants to Parent and Merger Sub an assignable (provided
that any such assignment is in compliance with Section 9.8) and irrevocable
option (the "Top-Up Option") to purchase from the Company the number of newly-
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-
Up Shares") equal to the lesser of: (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned
by Parent or Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option,
constitutes 80% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be
outstanding on a fully-diluted basis immediately after the issuance of all
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option, or (ii) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is
authorized to issue under the Company Articles but that are not issued and
outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued or
reserved for issuance) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option.

  

  

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Merger Sub, in whole or in
part, at any time at or after the Acceptance Time. The aggregate purchase
price payable for the shares of Company Common Stock being purchased by Parent
or Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying
the number of such shares by the Offer Price. Such purchase price may be paid
by Parent or Merger Sub, at its election, either entirely in cash or by
executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal
amount equal to such purchase price, or by any combination of the foregoing.
Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of 3% per annum,
shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of
such promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty.

  

  

(c) In the event Parent or Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Parent or Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth: (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that Parent or Merger Sub intends
to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which the Parent
or Merger Sub intends to pay the applicable purchase price, and (iii) the
place and time at which the closing of the purchase of such shares of Company
Common Stock by Parent or Merger Sub is to take place. The Company shall, as
soon as practicable following receipt of such notice, notify Merger Sub of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis and
the number of Top-Up Shares. At the closing of the purchase of such shares of
Company Common Stock, Parent or Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the
Company the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such
shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Parent or Merger Sub (as
the case may be) a certificate representing such shares. The parties shall
cooperate to cause the issuance of the Top-Up Shares to be effected pursuant
to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

  

  

ARTICLE II

Section 2.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the FBCA, Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease (the "Merger"). The Company shall be the
surviving corporation (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the Laws of the State of
Florida, and the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue
unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Section 2.7 and Section 2.8.
The effect of the Merger will be as provided in the applicable provisions of
the FBCA and the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.2 Effective Time.

  

  

(a) The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices
of Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P., 2200 Ross Avenue, Suite 2800, Dallas, Texas,

and the Offer, shall take place at the offices of Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P.,
2200 Ross Avenue, Suite 2800, Dallas, Texas, 75201 or at such other place as

(b) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause articles of merger
(the "Articles of Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Florida in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the FBCA and other applicable Florida Law. The Merger will
become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Florida on the Closing Date, or at such
subsequent date or time as the Company and Parent agree in writing and specify
in the Articles of Merger. The date and time the Merger becomes effective is
hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time."

  

  

Section 2.3 Conversion or Cancellation of Company Common Stock.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company or the holder of any of the following
securities:

  

  

(i) each share of the Company's $0.01 par value common stock (the "Company
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (A) shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or
any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, (B) Dissenting Shares
held by Dissenting Shareholders and (C) shares of Company Common Stock held in
the Company's treasury or held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company),
shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash per share equal
to the Offer Price, without interest (the "Merger Consideration");

  

  

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and held in the Company's
treasury or held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall (A) cease
to be outstanding, (B) be canceled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor, and (C) cease to exist; and

  

  

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or any
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub shall (A) cease to be
outstanding, (B) be canceled and retired without payment of any consideration
therefor, and (C) cease to exist.

  

  

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock converted into Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 2.3 (collectively, the "Shares"), shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously representing any such
Shares and non-certificated Shares represented by a book entry (the "Book
Entry Shares") shall thereafter represent the right to receive, with respect
to each underlying Share, the Merger Consideration.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any
stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, recapitalization or other similar transaction,
or if a record date with respect to any such event shall occur during such
period, then an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the
Merger Consideration.

  

  

Section 2.4 Merger Sub Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, be converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (which shares shall not be
deemed to be shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time for purposes of this Agreement).

  

  

Section 2.5 Dissenting Shares. The provisions of this Section 2.5 shall not
apply unless the shareholders of the Company are determined to have the right
to dissent from the Merger, and receive the fair value of their shares of
Company Common Stock, pursuant to Sections 607.1301-607.1333 of the FBCA. In
such event, and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a shareholder who did not
vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to,
and who complies in all respects with, the applicable provisions of the FBCA
(the "Dissenting Shareholders"), shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the
"Dissenting Shares"), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of
the appraised value of such shares in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the FBCA (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the applicable provisions of the FBCA), unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the FBCA. If any Dissenting
Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right, such holder's shares shall thereupon become Shares and be
treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the
right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each
such share of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3(a)(i),
without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the FBCA and received by the Company relating to shareholders'
rights of appraisal, and (b) the opportunity to participate in negotiations
and Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the FBCA. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such
demand for payment.

  

  

Section 2.6 Company Options and Other Equity Interests.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock issued pursuant to a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each such option, a "Company Option") whether or
not then vested, shall be converted into the right to receive, at the
Effective Time, a cash payment from the Surviving Corporation equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option, and (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration
over (y) the exercise price per share under such Company Option (such product,
the "Option Consideration").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock
unit issued pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (a "Company Restricted Stock
Unit") that has not otherwise vested shall become fully vested and shall be
converted into the right to receive a cash payment from the Surviving
Corporation equal to the Merger Consideration, and each such Company
Restricted Stock Unit shall thereupon be cancelled.

  

  

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted share
of Company Common Stock issued pursuant to a Company Stock Plan (each such
share, a "Company Restricted Share") that has not otherwise vested shall
become fully vested and shall be converted into the right to receive a cash
payment from the Surviving Corporation equal to the Merger Consideration, and
each such Company Restricted Stock Unit shall thereupon be cancelled.

  

  

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Options, the
holders of Company Restricted Stock Units, and the holders of Company
Restricted Shares the cash payments described in this Section 2.6 on or as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within
ten (10) Business Days following the Closing Date.

  

  

(e) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Compensation Committee of the Company
Board (the "Compensation Committee") or the Company Board, as applicable,
shall make such adjustments and amendments to or make such determinations with
respect to Company Options, Company Restricted Stock Units, and Company
Restricted Shares to implement the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.6.

  

  

Section 2.7 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time, the Company Articles shall be amended so as to read
in their entirety as is set forth in Exhibit A annexed hereto, and, as so
amended, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and as provided by
Law.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the Company Bylaws shall be amended so as to read in
their entirety in the form as is set forth in Exhibit B annexed hereto, and,
as so amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by Law.

  

  

Section 2.8 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of
the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time, each to
serve as a director or officer in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 2.9 Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate a bank or trust company (the "Paying Agent") to receive the
aggregate Merger Consideration that holders of Shares shall be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(i) (the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 2.10 Exchange of Shares.

  

  

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will instruct the
Paying Agent to mail to the Persons who, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, were record holders of certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock ("Certificates") whose Shares are being converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.3: (i) a letter of transmittal (in
customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify, including a provision confirming that delivery of Certificates shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent), and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate
or Book Entry Shares for exchange and cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent or Parent: (A) the holder
of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of Merger Consideration provided in Section 2.3
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book Entry Shares, and (B)
the Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any cash or on any unpaid
dividends or distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Book Entry
Shares pursuant to the provisions of Article II.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, holders of Certificates and Book Entry Shares that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights as shareholders of the Company, other than with respect to
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 2.5, and the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company
of the shares of Company Common Stock which were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book Entry Shares representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Paying Agent, each such share shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.10. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock which are not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a Person other than the holder in whose name the
Certificate is so surrendered is registered, if any such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and such holder
shall pay any fiduciary or surety bonds or any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person
other than such holder or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.10, each Certificate and Book Entry Share shall
be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent solely the right to
receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly evidenced by such Certificate or book entry. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its sole discretion and as
a condition to the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.3(a)(i), require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to
provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in customary form and

the Company Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited
statements to the absence of footnotes to the extent permitted by Regulation
S-X that would not differ materially from the footnotes to the financial
statements included in audited financial statements and recurring year-end
audit adjustments normal in nature and amount, the effect of which is not,

their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published Regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP

of access thereto and therefrom). The Company (x) has implemented and

adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that

Company's internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were

to believe that the Company's outside auditors, chief executive officer and
chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the Regulations adopted pursuant to Section

Section 3.10 Property.

  

  

(a) Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter identifies all real
property and interests in real property owned in fee by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries. The Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
has good, valid and marketable title to the Owned Real Property, free and
clear of any Lien, other than Permitted Encumbrances. There are no outstanding
options or rights of first refusal to purchase the Owned Real Property, or any
portion of the Owned Real Property or interest therein. The major structural
elements of the improvements comprising each parcel of Owned Real Property,
including mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilation, air conditioning or
plumbing systems, elevators or parking elements, are in sufficiently good
condition in all material respects to allow the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries to be operated in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice.

  

  

(b) Section 3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the
date hereof, a true, correct and complete list of the Company's real property
which is leased, subleased or licensed to the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (the "Leased Real Property" and together with the Owned Real
Property, the "Real Property"). The lease, sublease or license for each such
Leased Real Property (each a "Lease") is valid, legally binding, enforceable
and in full force and effect in all material respects with respect to the
applicable Company or Company Subsidiary and, to the Company's Knowledge, the
applicable counterparty thereto. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is in breach of or default under, in any material respects, the
terms of any Lease (or has taken or failed to take any action which with
notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default thereunder).
Prior to the date hereof, the Company has provided or made available to Parent
true and complete copies of each Lease as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

  

  

(c) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Real Property is in material
compliance with all applicable zoning Laws and building codes, and the
buildings and improvements located on the Real Property are in good operating
condition and in a state of good working order, in all material respects.
There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
Proceedings with respect to or otherwise affecting the Real Property. The
Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable health and safety related Legal Requirements for
the Real Property, including those under the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990 and the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970. The Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, individually or together, own, lease or have the right
to use all of their properties and assets reflected in the Company Balance
Sheet or otherwise used by them in connection with the conduct of their
businesses, other than any properties or assets that have been sold or
otherwise disposed of since the Company Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice (all such properties and
assets, excluding the Owned Real Property, the Leased Real Property, and the
Company IP (which is solely covered by the representation included in Section
3.17), are referred to as "Assets"). Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries has good title to, or in the case of leased or subleased Assets,
valid and subsisting leasehold interests in, all of the Assets free and clear
of Liens of any nature whatsoever, other than Permitted Encumbrances.

or prior to the date hereof.

  

  

(b) (i) Each Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company or the
applicable Company Subsidiary, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms and is in full force and effect, (ii) the Company and each of the
Company Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company, each other party
thereto has duly performed all obligations required to be performed by it
under each Material Contract, and (iii) no event or condition exists that
constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a
breach, violation or default on the part of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto,
under any such Material Contract. There are no disputes pending or to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Material Contract.

(a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with all applicable Laws, and are not in default or violation of, and
have not received any notices of violation with respect to, any Laws in
connection with the conduct of their respective businesses or the ownership or
operation of their respective businesses, assets and properties.

  

  

(b) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have obtained and hold all
Permits that are necessary to own, lease or otherwise hold, use and operate
their properties, rights and other assets and are necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses, including all Permits to operate end-
stage renal disease facilities or dialysis facilities, under and pursuant to
each, and have complied in all material respects with, and are not in default
or in violation in any material respect of, any Laws or legal requirements
applicable to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Such Permits are
in full force and effect and there are no Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened that seek the revocation, cancellation,
suspension or adverse modification thereof. The consummation of the Offer or
the Merger, in and of itself, would not cause any revocation, modification or
cancellation of any such Permit.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) The Company has been and is in compliance with the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

  

  

Section 3.13 Health Law Matters. Without limiting the scope or application of
representations or warranties of general application set forth elsewhere in
this Article III:

  

  

(a) Each of the Centers operated by the Company or a Company Subsidiary is
certified under the conditions of coverage and participation of the federal
Medicare program as a Medicare provider, specifically an end-stage renal
disease facility and each Center is certified or otherwise qualified as a
state Medicaid provider in the applicable State of operation. The Company has
provided copies of all surveys, reports or deficiency notices concerning the
Centers by the Medicare program, any state survey agency, and the applicable
state Medicaid programs for the five (5) year period prior to the date hereof.
The Medicare certification and applicable Medicaid certifications of each of
the Centers is in full force and effect, and each applicable Company
Subsidiary is under no suspension or plan of correction. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no violation of the Medicare conditions of coverage or Medicaid
certification conditions or qualifications exists and no event or
circumstances exists that with the giving of notice or passage of time, or
both, would constitute a violation. Neither CMS nor any state agency has
conducted or has given the Company or any Company Subsidiary any notice that
it intends to conduct any audit or other review of the Company's or any
Company Subsidiaries' participation in any governmental healthcare program,
including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, no such audit or review would result in any material liability by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary for any repayment, reimbursement, penalty or
interest with respect to payments received by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary thereunder or the suspension or exclusion of the Company or a
Company Subsidiary from participation in the applicable governmental health
program. There is not pending or threatened any Proceeding under a program by
a Governmental Entity involving the Company, a Company Subsidiary or any
Center. To the Knowledge of the Company, each Center medical director is
qualified in accordance with the Medicare conditions of coverage and
applicable Law to serve as the medical director of such Center. Except as set
forth in Section 3.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no
certificate of need requirements in the states in which the Company and each
Company Subsidiary operates or has operated since December 31, 2006.

  

  

(b) Section 3.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete list
of all Company Subsidiaries owned in part (directly or indirectly) by
physicians, Immediate Family Members of physicians or other Persons who are in
a position to make or influence referrals to or otherwise generate business
for the Company or any Company Subsidiary, the names of each physician or
other such owner and the percentage interest of each owner of the Company
Subsidiary ("Joint Venture Subsidiaries"). The terms upon which physicians,
Immediate Family Members of physicians and other Third Party investors in a
position to make or influence referrals to or otherwise generate business for
the applicable Company Subsidiary were offered investment interests in the
Joint Ventures Subsidiaries were no different than the terms offered to Third
Party investors not in a position to make referrals and were not related to
the previous or expected volume or value of referrals, items or services
furnished or the amount of business otherwise generated by the physician,
Immediate Family Member or Third Party investors to the applicable Company
Subsidiary. There is no requirement that physician owners or non-owners
attending patients of a Joint Venture Subsidiary make referrals to, furnish
items or services to, or otherwise generate business for the Joint Venture
Subsidiary in order to remain an owner of or to be eligible to provide
services at the Joint Venture Subsidiary. All Joint Venture Subsidiary
distributions or payments to owners are directly proportional to the owner's
capital investment in the Joint Venture Subsidiary. Except as set forth in
Section 3.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has loaned funds to, or guaranteed a loan for, any Third
Party investor for use by such Third Party investor in investing in a Joint
Venture Subsidiary.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

24  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Section 3.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete list
of all agreements between the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on one hand,
and any physician or Immediate Family Member of a physician on the other hand,
including all medical director agreements, equipment or space leases and
sublease agreements ("Physician Contracts"). True and complete copies of all
Physician Contracts in effect on the date hereof have been made available to
Parent on or prior to the date hereof. Except as set forth in Section 3.13(c)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, each Physician Contract is in full force and
effect, is on commercially reasonable terms, is in writing and is signed by
the parties thereto with an initial term of at least one year. The
compensation or rental charge of each Physician Contract was negotiated at
arms' length, is consistent with fair market value and was not determined in a
manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or
business otherwise generated between the parties or using a percentage-based
or per unit of service compensation formula. Except as set forth in Section
3.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each Physician Contract involving
the lease of equipment or space is for the full time use of the equipment or
space by the lessee. No Physician Contract for the lease of space or equipment
exceeds that which is reasonably necessary for the legitimate business
purposes of the lease or rental.

  

  

(d) Each Company Subsidiary is in compliance with the anti-kickback provisions
of the federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. Sections 1320a-7a and 7b (in all
material respects), and the federal anti-physician self referral Law commonly
known as the "Stark" law (42 U.S.C. Section 1395nn) (the "Stark Law"), and
equivalent state Laws, as those Laws relate to the ownership interests in the
Company and in Company Subsidiaries and any financial relationships or
compensation arrangements that the Company or any Company Subsidiary may have
with any partners, owners or Affiliates of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or with any health care facility or physician, including any
medical director. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary furnishes any
items or services considered "designated health services" under the Stark Law
or any item or service (including outpatient prescription drugs) not excluded
from Stark Law restrictions under applicable Regulations.

  

  

(e) The Company's and each of the Company Subsidiaries' billing practices are
in compliance in all material respects with all Laws and, where applicable, in
compliance with all contracts with insurance companies, health maintenance
organizations and other managed care and third-party payors. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, none
of the predecessors of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, in respect of
any dialysis or other business to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
succeeded, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no Person providing
professional, billing, management or marketing services to or on behalf of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, has engaged in any activities that are
prohibited under 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7b, 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7, 42
U.S.C. Section 1395nn or 31 U.S.C. Section 3729-3733, inclusive of the federal
False Claims Act (or any other federal or state statute related to false or
fraudulent claims) or the Regulations promulgated under such statutes
including the following: (i) making or causing to be made a false statement or
representation of a fact in any application for any benefit or payment from

on behalf of another, and (iv) soliciting, offering, paying or receiving any

indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind or offering to pay or
receive such remuneration (A) in return for referring an individual to a
Person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or
service for which payment may be made in whole or in part by any federal or
state health care program, including Medicare and Medicaid, or (B) in return
for purchasing, leasing or ordering or arranging for or recommending
purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service or item for which
payment may be made in whole or in part by any federal or state health care
program, including Medicare and Medicaid.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

25  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(f) (i) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any of their respective predecessors in respect of any dialysis
or other business to which any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have succeeded, has engaged in activities that are prohibited under the
applicable administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, including the criminal provisions
thereunder related to federal health care offenses, or any Regulations
promulgated thereunder (collectively, "HIPAA"), and (ii) the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects with HIPAA,
including applicable HIPAA administrative simplification provisions and the
standards and regulations regarding privacy, security and transaction and code
set standards, as well as applicable state Laws and Regulations respecting
privacy and data security. Except as set forth in Section 3.13(f) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, there are no current and since December 31, 2006
there have not been, any breaches of HIPAA, or the Regulations promulgated
thereunder, including any breach of the privacy standards or an unauthorized
disclosure of protected health information, and no notifications or reports
have been issued by or required to be filed by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to patients of the Centers or with any Governmental Entity with
respect to a breach of HIPAA or applicable state Laws and Regulations
respecting privacy and security.

  

  

(g) The Company currently maintains in respect of the operations of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary a compliance program designed to promote
compliance with applicable Laws and ethical standards (including those Laws
described in Section 3.13(d) and (e) hereof and Laws requiring written
identity theft prevention programs (e.g., the FTC "Red Flag" rules)), to
improve the quality and performance of operations, and to detect, prevent, and
address violations of legal or ethical standards applicable to the operations
of its business (the "Compliance Program"). To the Company's Knowledge, the
Compliance Program incorporates any applicable guideline issued by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services and other federal and state agencies.
The Company has conducted its operations in accordance with all material
requirements of its Compliance Program. The Company has not received any
notice that (i) any Person providing services under the Contracts, including
the Physician Contracts, or (ii) any employee or contractor, in either case of
clause (i) or (ii), has been charged with, or has been convicted of, a
criminal offense related to the Medicare, Medicaid or TRICARE programs, or the
provision of health care items or services but has not yet been excluded,
debarred or otherwise declared ineligible to participate in such programs or
is proposed for exclusion therefrom. The Company is not in the process of
preparing and has not previously submitted or filed any voluntary disclosure
report to any Governmental Entity, including with the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Service's Office of Inspector General pursuant to its
provider self-disclosure protocol.

  

  

(h) Prior to the date hereof, the Company has delivered to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of Compliance Certificates executed by the persons

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered in
compliance with its terms and the provisions of applicable Laws. All equity

meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Title IV of ERISA, and neither
the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has ever incurred any liability
under Title IV of ERISA, and no condition exists that presents a material risk

or any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability under such Sections,
and no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any of
its ERISA Affiliates of incurring a liability under such Sections. No Company
Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (within the meaning of Section

meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA), and none of the Company or any of its
ERISA Affiliates has ever contributed to or had an obligation to contribute,

(e) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened

(f) No Company Benefit Plan subject to Title I or ERISA holds any "employer
security" or "employer real property" (each as defined in Section 407(d) of
ERISA).

  

  

(g) Each compensation arrangement between the Company and a service provider
and each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code
complies with Section 409A of the Code (and has so complied for the entire
period during which Section 409A of the Code has applied to such arrangement
or Company Benefit Plan). None of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will constitute or result in a deferral of compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code.

  

  

(h) Except as set forth on Section 3.15(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the

Section 5.3 Third Party Proposals

  

  

(a) The Company shall not (and shall not resolve or propose to), directly or
indirectly, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and each officer,
director, Employee, agent and representative of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary (including any accountant, attorney, investment banker, financial
advisor or other representatives of the Company) (collectively, the "Company
Representatives") to not (and to not resolve or propose to), directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, induce, facilitate (including by
way of furnishing information) or take any other action to facilitate the
making, submission or announcement of any inquiries or proposals regarding any
merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of
capital stock (including by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions
involving the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that, if consummated,
would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing, including
any inquiries, proposals or, including the indication of any intention to
propose any of the foregoing, being referred to herein as an "Alternative
Proposal"), (ii) furnish any information regarding the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with or in response to any
Alternative Proposal or Alternative Transaction, (iii) conduct, engage in or
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative
Proposal or Alternative Transaction, or (iv) enter into any agreement
regarding any Alternative Proposal or Alternative Transaction.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.3(a), prior to the
Acceptance Time, Section 5.3(a) shall not prohibit the Company Board from
furnishing non-public information regarding the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person
in response to (and in connection with) an unsolicited bona fide Alternative
Proposal that is submitted to the Company by such Person (and not withdrawn)
if: (i) neither the Company, the Company Subsidiaries nor Company
Representative shall have breached or taken any action inconsistent with any
of the provisions of Section 5.3, (ii) the Company Board reasonably
determines, after having taken into account the advice of the Company
Financial Advisor and the Company's outside legal counsel, that such
Alternative Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a
Superior Proposal, (iii) the Company Board reasonably determines, after having
taken into account the advice of the Company's outside legal counsel, that
such action is required in order for the Company Board to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law, (iv)
at least two (2) Business Days prior to furnishing any such non-public
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, the Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of such Person
and of the Company's intention to furnish non-public information to, or enter
into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, and the Company receives
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary
limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public written and oral
information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company, a
customary "standstill" provision, and such additional customary provisions no
less favorable to the Company than the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, and (v) prior to or concurrently with furnishing any such non-
public information to such Person, the Company furnishes such non-public
information to Parent (to the extent such non-public information has not been
previously furnished by the Company to Parent). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that any
action inconsistent with any of the provisions set forth in the preceding
sentence taken by any Company Representative, whether or not such Company
Representative is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, shall be deemed to constitute a breach of Section 5.3(a) by the
Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative
receives an Alternative Proposal or any request for non-public information
prior to the Effective Time, then the Company shall promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt of such Alternative Proposal or request)
advise Parent orally and in writing of such Alternative Proposal or request.
Such notice shall set forth the identity of the Third Party making or
submitting the Alternative Proposal or request, the material terms and
conditions thereof, and, if available, any written documentation received from
or on behalf of such Third Party setting forth such terms and conditions. The
Company shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of any changes
in the status of, and modification to, the terms of any such Alternative
Proposal or request, and provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and in any
event within 24 hours) after receipt or delivery copies of all correspondence
and other written material sent or provided to the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries from any Third Party with respect thereto, and notify
Parent orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing information
or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Alternative Proposal
pursuant to Section 5.3. The Company shall also provide Parent at least 48
hours prior written notice of any meeting of the Company Board at which the
Company Board is reasonably expected to consider an Alternative Proposal. The
Company shall not enter into any confidentiality or other agreement that would
impede its ability to comply with its obligations under this Section 5.3(c).

  

  

(d) The Company shall, and shall ensure that the Company Subsidiaries, and
cause all Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, and shall not authorize or permit any of the Company
Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities, encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with any Third Party with respect to any of the
foregoing, and shall (i) immediately direct all Third Parties who have been
furnished confidential information regarding the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries in consideration of or discussions with respect to an Alternative
Proposal, Alternative Transaction or equity investment to promptly return or
destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such information and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to enforce its remedies under the applicable Contracts
with such Third Party (or such Third Party's Representative) and (ii) prohibit
any Third Party from having access to any physical or electronic data rooms
relating to a possible Alternative Proposal or Alternative Transaction. The
Company further agrees not to, and to cause the Company Subsidiaries not to,
waive, terminate, amend, modify or release any Third Party from, or permit the
waiver, termination, amendment, modification or release of, or fail to enforce
the confidentiality, "standstill" or similar provisions of any agreement to
which the Company or the Company Subsidiaries is or may become a party or
under which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has or acquires any
rights. The Company shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate
any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions
authorizing any Third Party to make an Alternative Proposal. Neither the
Company nor the Company Board shall approve or take any action to render
inapplicable to any Alternative Proposal or Alternative Transaction Sections
607.0901 or 607.0902 of the FBCA or any similar Takeover Statutes or any
restrictive provision or any applicable anti-takeover provision in the Company
Articles or the Company Bylaws.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Except as permitted by Section 5.3(f) or Section 5.3(g), neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make, withdraw,
amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify,
in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the unanimous Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, or cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement constituting or relating to, or that is intended to, contemplates or
is reasonably likely to result in, an Alternative Transaction, other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.3(b) (an "Acquisition
Agreement") or resolve, agree or propose to take any such action, (iii)
approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse,
adopt or recommend, any Alternative Proposal or Superior Proposal, (iv) fail
to recommend to the shareholders of the Company that they reject any tender
offer or exchange offer for the Company Common Stock and reaffirm the
unanimous Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement of such offer (or, if earlier, prior to the Acceptance Time), (v)
make any public statement inconsistent with the Company Board Recommendation,
or (vi) resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing actions (any of the
foregoing, an "Adverse Recommendation Change").

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(e), the
Company Board may, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change and thereafter may cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(h) and concurrently with such
termination cause the Company to enter into a Superior Proposal Definitive
Agreement in accordance and subject to compliance with the provisions of
Section 8.1(h), if: (i) an unsolicited bona fide, written Alternative Proposal
that did not otherwise result from a breach of the provisions of this Section
5.3 is made to the Company and is not withdrawn, (ii) the Company Board
reasonably determines, after having taken into account the advice of the
Company Financial Advisor, that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (iii) the Company Board reasonably determines, after having
taken into account the advice of the Company's outside legal counsel, that in
light of such Superior Proposal, an Adverse Recommendation Change is required
in order for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the
Company's shareholders under applicable Legal Requirements, (iv) prior to
effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change the Company Board shall have
given Parent at least five (5) Business Days' written notice: (A) that it has
received a Superior Proposal not in violation of the provisions of this
Section 5.3, (B) that it intends to make an Adverse Recommendation Change, and
(C) specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal,
including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal (and
attaching the most current and complete version of any written agreement or
other document relating thereto) (it being understood and agreed that any
modification thereto shall require a new five (5) Business Days' advance
written notice by the Company), (v) during any such five (5) Business Day
notice period(s), if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith
negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that no
Adverse Recommendation Change is legally required as a result of such Superior
Proposal, and (vi) at the end of any such five (5) Business Day notice period,
the Company Board reasonably determines that the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change would still constitute a breach of the fiduciary
obligations of the Company Board to the Company's shareholders under
applicable Legal Requirements in light of such Superior Proposal (taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a
result of the negotiations required by clause (v) or otherwise).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.3(e), the
Company Board may, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, if: (i) there shall occur or arise after the date of
this Agreement a material event, material development or material change in
circumstances that relates to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (but
does not relate to any Alternative Proposal) that was not known to, or
reasonably foreseeable by, any of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries on
or prior to the date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of which
are not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof), which event, development or change in
circumstance, or any material consequences thereof, becomes known to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Acceptance Time (any such
material event, material development or material change in circumstances
unrelated to an Alternative Proposal being referred to as an "Intervening
Event"), (ii) none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company
Representative had knowledge, as of the date of this Agreement, that there was
a reasonable possibility that such Intervening Event could occur or arise
after the date of this Agreement, (iii) the Company provides Parent, at least
five (5) Business Days prior to any meeting of the Company Board at which the
Company Board will consider and determine whether such Intervening Event may
require the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to
clause (i) of the definition of Adverse Recommendation Change, with a written
notice specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding
such meeting and a reasonably detailed description of such Intervening Event,
(iv) the Company Board reasonably determines, after having taken into account
the advice of the Company's outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Intervening Event, an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to clause (i) of
the definition of Adverse Recommendation Change is required in order for the
Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company's
Shareholders under applicable Legal Requirements, (v) no Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of Adverse
Recommendation Change has been made for five (5) Business Days after receipt
by Parent of a written notice from the Company confirming that the Company
Board has determined that the failure to make such an Adverse Recommendation
Change in light of such Intervening Event would constitute a breach of its
fiduciary obligations to the Company's shareholders under applicable Legal
Requirements, (vi) during such five (5) Business Day notice period, if
requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with
Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that no such Adverse
Recommendation Change is legally required as a result of such Intervening
Event, and (vii) at the end of such five (5) Business Day notice period, the
Company Board reasonably determines that the failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change would still constitute a breach of the fiduciary
obligations of the Company Board to the Company's Shareholders under
applicable Legal Requirements in light of such Intervening Event (taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as a
result of the negotiations required by clause (vi) or otherwise).

  

  

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 5.3 shall prevent the Company Board from
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with regard
to an Alternative Proposal; provided that this Section 5.3(h) shall not be
deemed to permit the Company Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
take any of the actions referred to in clause (ii) of Section 5.3(e) except,
in each case, to the extent permitted by Section 5.3(f) and Section 5.3(g).

  

  

(i) The Company shall ensure that the Company Subsidiaries are aware of, and
shall cause the Company Representatives to be aware of, the restrictions
described in this Section 5.3.

Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent shall own, by virtue of

Parent a reasonable opportunity to comment on the Proxy Statement, any
correspondence with the SEC or its staff (including any staff comments on the
Proxy Statement) or any proposed material to be included in or with the Proxy
Statement prior to transmission to the SEC or its staff and shall not, except
as may be required under the Exchange Act, transmit any such document or
material to which Parent reasonably objects. The Company shall respond
promptly to any comments received from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement, and shall correct promptly any information in the Proxy
Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect. If the solicitation of the Company's
shareholders is required, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit, from the holders of Company Common Stock, proxies in favor
of this Agreement and the Merger. If at any time prior to the Shareholders
Meeting there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare such
an amendment or supplement and, after obtaining the consent of Parent to such
amendment or supplement (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), shall promptly transmit such amendment or supplement

contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
consents or waivers from Third Parties, including the Company Consents, (ii)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or no-actions, waivers, consents,
authorization, Permits, Orders and approvals from, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary
to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by
any Governmental Entity, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that
they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all Permits
and consents of all Third Parties and Governmental Entities, and the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act
and under any other Antitrust Law necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any objections that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement, the
Offer and the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and the Company shall keep Parent apprised of the status of matters relating
to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, each of
Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, in
connection with the efforts referenced in Section 6.4(a) to obtain all
requisite actions, no-actions, waivers, consents, authorizations, Permits,
Orders, approvals, exemptions, and expirations or terminations of applicable
waiting periods for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, (i) cooperate in all respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) keep the other party and its counsel informed of any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice (the "DOJ") or any other Governmental Entity and of any
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (iii) permit the other party and its counsel to review in
advance any written communication intended to be given by it to, and consult
with each other in advance of any meeting, discussion, telephone call or
conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and
to the extent not prohibited by the FTC, the DOJ or other Governmental Entity
or other Person, give the other party and its counsel the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meeting, discussion, telephone call and
conference. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to stay, hold or
extend any applicable working period under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Law
without the prior written consent of the other. Parent and the Company may, as
each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 6.4(b) as
"Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express written permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company as
the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 6.4(b), materials provided to the other party or its
outside counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation
of the Company Common Stock or the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, "Antitrust Law" means the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all Laws, Orders and judicial doctrines
that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having
the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition.

  

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 6.4, the parties hereto shall (i) provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as practicable to Governmental Entities with regulatory jurisdiction
over enforcement of any Antitrust Laws (each such Governmental Entity, a
"Governmental Antitrust Authority") information and documents requested by any
Governmental Antitrust Authority or necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
preparing and filing any notification and report form and related material
required under the HSR Act and any additional consents and filings under any
Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement
(but in no event more than fifteen (15) Business Days from the date hereof
except by mutual consent confirmed in writing) and thereafter to respond as
promptly as practicable to any request for additional information or
documentary material that may be made under the HSR Act and any additional
consents and filings under any Antitrust Laws, (ii) use their reasonable best
efforts to take such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt
approval of consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
any Governmental Entity, and (iii) use their commercially reasonable efforts
to contest on the merits, through litigation in United States District Court
and through administrative procedures in relation to other Governmental
Entities, any objections or opposition raised by any Governmental Entity;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.4(c) shall require Parent to
appeal any Order from a Governmental Entity.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.4(b) with respect to Antitrust
Counsel Only Material, Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish
each other with all information concerning themselves, their respective
Subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees and shareholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any
statement, filing, notice, application or other document made by or on behalf
of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(f) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall give (or shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to Third Parties, and use,
and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts
to obtain any Third-Party consents, including the Company Consents. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense of any Proceeding against the
Company and its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and will obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to
settling or satisfying any such Proceeding.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in connection
with the receipt of any necessary governmental approvals or clearances
(including under any Antitrust Law), Parent shall not be required to sell,
hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its business in a specified
manner, or permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any
assets or business of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or the conduct of their business in a specified manner prior to
or following the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 6.5 Public Disclosure. Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement regarding the terms of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and neither shall issue any such press release
or make any such statement without the prior approval of the other (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except
as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public statement or
disclosure shall consult with the other party about, and allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on, such press release or announcement in advance
of such disclosure, and the party will consider such comments in good faith;
provided, however, that any subsequent public statement or disclosure that is
consistent with a public statement or disclosure previously approved by the
other party shall not require a further prior approval of such other party.

  

  

Section 6.6 Cooperation. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein
provided, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement (including Section
6.4), each of the parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take or cause to be taken all action, to do or cause to be done and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including: (a) the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligations
of the Company (in the case of Parent) or Parent and Merger Sub (in the case
of the Company) to the Offer and the Merger, (b) the obtaining of applicable
consents, waivers or approvals of any Third Party required under the terms of
Material Contracts, (c) the defending of any proceeding challenging this
Agreement or the performance of the obligations hereunder, and (d) the
execution and delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other
actions, as any other party may reasonably request in order to carry out this
Agreement.

Section 6.7 Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) From the Effective Time through at least December 31, 2010, Parent shall
maintain or cause to be maintained employee benefit plans and compensation
opportunities for the benefit of employees (as a group) who are actively
employed by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (the
"Closing Date Employees") that provide employee benefits and compensation
opportunities which, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to the
employee benefits and compensation opportunities (other than equity-based
compensation) that were provided to such Closing Date Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) To the extent that a Closing Date Employee becomes eligible to participate
in an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
Parent shall (i) cause such employee benefit plan to recognize the service of
such Closing Date Employee with the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (or
their predecessor entities) for purposes of eligibility, participation,
vesting, and benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (excluding the Company Stock Plans which shall be
terminated by the Company without liability to Parent or the Company
contemporaneously with the Effective Time), to the same extent such service
was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Closing Date Employee was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that such
recognition of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefits of a
Closing Date Employee with respect to the same period of service, and (ii)
with respect to any health, dental, vision or other welfare plan of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries)
in which any Closing Date Employee is eligible to participate for the plan
year in which such Closing Date Employee is first eligible to participate, use
its reasonable best efforts (subject to applicable plan limitations) to (x)
cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods
under such Parent or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Closing
Date Employee, to the extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Closing Date Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) recognize any
health, dental or vision expenses incurred by such Closing Date Employee in
the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such
Closing Date Employee is first eligible to participate) for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such health, dental or vision plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.
Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take any action to deny COBRA benefits to
any Closing Date Employee who is otherwise eligible for such benefits.

  

  

(c) The Company shall take all actions that may be requested by Parent in
writing prior to the Acceptance Time with respect to (i) causing one or more
Company Benefit Plans or arrangements with any payroll, benefits or human
resources services provider to the Company to terminate or be amended as of
the Closing Date, (ii) causing benefit accrual or entitlement under any
Company Benefit Plan to cease as of the Closing Date, (iii) causing the
continuation on and after the Closing Date of any insurance policy or
arrangement relating to any Company Benefit Plan, and (iv) facilitating the
merger of any Company Benefit Plan into any employee benefit plan maintained
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Nothing in this Section 6.7 shall be construed to limit the right of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to amend or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment or
termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, nor shall
anything in this Section 6.7 be construed to prohibit the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) from terminating the employment of any particular
Closing Date Employee following the Closing Date.

  

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.9, the provisions of this
Section 6.7 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee, director or independent contractor or any other
individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as
an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan for
any purpose.

  

  

Section 6.8 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

  

  

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain officers' and directors' liability insurance
in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering
each such person currently covered by the Company's officers' and directors'
liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no
less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof, if any;
provided that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.8(a), neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual premiums
in excess of 225% of the annual premium payable by the Company for such policy
(the "Current Premium"), which amount is set forth in Section 6.8(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, and if such premiums for such insurance would at
any time exceed 225% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving
Corporation's judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual
premium equal to 225% of the Current Premium. The Company shall be permitted
to purchase a prepaid "tail" or runoff policy under the Company's officers'
and directors' liability insurance policy prior to the Closing; provided that
the cost of such "tail" or runoff policy does not exceed 225% of the Current
Premium, which policy may provide such directors and officers with coverage
for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from
facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that the
amount paid for such prepaid policy does not exceed 225% of the Current
Premium. The provisions of the first sentence of this Section 6.8(a) shall be
deemed to have been satisfied if a prepaid "tail" or runoff policy has been
obtained prior to the Effective Time. If such a prepaid "tail" or runoff
policy has been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect for their
full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries pursuant
to: (i) each indemnification agreement in effect between the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries and any person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties"), and (ii) any indemnification provision and any
exculpation provision set forth in the Company Articles or the Company Bylaws
as in effect on the date of this Agreement. From the Effective Time through
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation
and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Parent shall
cause the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former
directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries than are
presently set forth in the Company Articles and the Company Bylaws and such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed, or otherwise modified in any manner
that could adversely affect the rights thereunder of any person benefited by
such provisions. If, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as applicable, a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification under any of the provisions set forth in clauses (i) or (ii)
above, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved.

  

  

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.8.

  

  

Section 6.9 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may
approve, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act and in accordance with the Interpretative Letter dated
January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC relating to Rule 16b-3, any dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities with respect
to equity securities of the Company) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director of the Company who
is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to equity securities
of the Company.

  

  

Section 6.10 Shareholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any shareholder
litigation against the Company or its officers or directors relating to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall
be agreed to without Parent's prior written consent.

  

  

Section 6.11 State Takeover Laws. If any "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover statute becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent, or Merger Sub, with respect to the Offer,
the Merger, the Support Agreements or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement (other than any Alternative Transaction), then each of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective board of directors shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such statute
inapplicable to the foregoing. The Company and the Company Board shall not
take any action to approve any Alternative Proposal made by a Third Party for
purposes of any state anti-takeover Law or to cause any state anti-takeover
Law that would otherwise apply to any such Alternative Proposal to become
inapplicable thereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 6.12 Financing.

  

  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing
Commitment, including using their reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect thereto and (ii) to satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Parent in such definitive agreements that
are within its control. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing
Commitment, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources on comparable terms or terms
not materially less favorable (as determined in the reasonable judgment of
Parent) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. In
connection with its obligations under this Section 6.12, Parent shall be
permitted to amend, modify or replace the Debt Financing Commitment, provided
that Parent shall not make, agree to or allow any modification to or
replacement of the conditions precedent to the funding set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment in a manner more favorable to the parties providing the
Debt Financing without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Parent shall give
the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the Debt
Financing Commitment of which Parent becomes aware or any termination of the
Debt Financing Commitment. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing.

  

  

(b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective officers, employees, Company Representatives and
advisors, including legal and accounting advisors, to provide, all reasonable
assistance and cooperation (including with respect to timeliness) in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, including (i) participation in meetings, presentations
(including management presentations), drafting sessions and due diligence
sessions, (ii) no later than the Offer Commencement Date, furnishing Parent
and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including
projections, pro forma statements, all financial statements and other
financial data and other pertinent information of the type required by
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, (iii) assisting in
the preparation of (A) an offering document and other customary marketing
materials for any of the Debt Financing and (B) materials for rating agency
presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the consummation of the Debt
Financing and the syndication and marketing efforts for any of the Debt
Financing, including obtaining any rating agency confirmations or approvals
for the Debt Financing, (v) providing and executing documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, including a certificate of the chief financial
officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to solvency
matters, and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials
relating to the Debt Financing, (vi) reasonably facilitating the pledging of
collateral, (vii) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain accountants'
comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance, as reasonably
requested by Parent, and (viii) taking all actions reasonably necessary for
the Company or any Subsidiary to become the borrower or a guarantor under the
Debt Financing prior to or simultaneously with the Closing; provided, however,
in each case, that none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time;
and provided further, that Parent shall reimburse the Company for reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such
assistance and cooperation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
obtained by Parent or the Parent Representatives pursuant to Section 6.12(b)
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement;
provided, however, that Parent and Merger Sub and its Representatives shall be
permitted to disclose information as necessary and consistent with customary
practices in connection with the Debt Financing upon the prior written consent
of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

  

  

Section 6.13 Notification.

  

  

(a) From and after the date hereof until the Closing Date, each party hereto
will promptly notify the other party hereto of (i) the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would be
likely to cause any condition to the Offer and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, and (ii) the
failure of such party to comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied
with by it pursuant to this Agreement which would be likely to result in any
condition to the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not to be satisfied. No delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 6.13(a) will cure any breach of any representation or warranty of
such party contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall promptly advise each
other of any change or event having a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

  

  

(b) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date, the Company will
provide to Parent copies of all surveys, reports or deficiency notices
concerning the Centers by the Medicare program, any state survey agency, and
the applicable state Medicaid programs for the period commencing on the date
hereof through the Closing Date.

  

  

Section 6.14 Resignation of Directors and Officers. To the extent requested by
Parent in writing prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing, to be
effective as of the Closing, duly signed resignations of each officer and
director of the Company designated by Parent.

  

  

Section 6.15 NASDAQ Compliance; Delisting. From the date of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier of the Board Appointment Date or the termination
of this Agreement, the Company (a) shall remain in compliance with all
applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ,
and (b) agrees not to take or permit to be taken on its behalf any action
which would result in the shares of Company Common Stock no longer being
listed on NASDAQ. From the Acceptance Time to the Closing Date, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things,
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law
(including the Regulations of NASDAQ) to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ and the deregistration of
the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 6.16 Payment of Company Expenses Upon Acceptance Time. Promptly
following the Acceptance Time, but in any event within three (3) Business Days
of the Acceptance Time, Parent will cause the Company to pay all fees, costs
and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the fees, costs and
expenses of its advisers, brokers, finders, agents, accountants, bankers and
legal counsel and the transaction expenses set forth in Section 6.16 of the
Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with the provisions set forth
thereon).

enforced which makes illegal, prevents or otherwise prohibits the consummation
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger; and

TERMINATION

  

  

Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and
the Merger may be abandoned;

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, in a written instrument authorized by their
respective boards of directors (notwithstanding receipt of the Required
Company Shareholder Vote);

  

  

(b) by either Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, at any time prior to the
Effective Time (notwithstanding receipt of the Required Company Shareholder
Vote), if any Governmental Entity shall have issued a final and non-appealable
Order, decree or ruling or takes any other action having the effect of (i)
permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting (A) the
acquisition or acceptance for payment of, or payment for, the shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer, or (B) the consummation of the
Merger, or (ii) making the acquisition or acceptance for payment of, or
payment for, the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or the
consummation of the Merger, illegal; provided, however, that a party shall not
be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b) if
the issuance of such Order, decree or ruling or the taking of such action is

54

shall not have occurred on or prior to 11:59 p.m., Dallas, Texas time on
January 31, 2011 (the "Outside Date"), provided, however, that: (i) a party
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(c) if: (A) the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur on or prior to the
Outside Date is attributable to the failure of an Offer Condition to be
satisfied, and (B) the failure of such Offer Condition to be satisfied is
attributable to a failure on the part of such party to perform any covenant in
this Agreement required to be performed by such party at or prior to the
Acceptance Time, and (ii) the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) unless the Company shall have made
any payment required to be made to Parent pursuant to Section 8.3(a);

  

  

(d) by the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if: (i) any of
Parent's representations or warranties contained in this Agreement shall be
inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement or shall have become inaccurate as
of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such
subsequent date) (it being understood that, for purposes of determining the
accuracy of such representations and warranties as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any subsequent date, all materiality qualifications
limiting the scope of such representations and warranties shall be
disregarded) and such inaccuracy has a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or (ii)

(e) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges and agrees that

(f) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(i),
the Parent shall pay to the Company in cash, within two (2) Business Days

in this Agreement, if this Agreement is terminated as set forth in Section
8.1(i), the Company's right to receive the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to

respective Affiliates do not) seek to recover any money damages or losses, or
seek to pursue any other recovery, judgment, damages or remedy (including any
equitable remedy) of any kind, in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties agree that the
Reverse Termination Fee and the agreements contained in this Section 8.3(f)
are an integral part of the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that the Reverse Termination Fee
constitutes liquidated damages and not a penalty. In addition, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, regardless of whether or
not this Agreement is terminated, except for Parent's obligation to pay the
Company the Reverse Termination Fee if and when such Reverse Termination Fee
becomes payable by Parent to the Company pursuant to this Section 8.3(f):

money damages or losses, or seek to pursue any other recovery, judgment,
damages or remedy (including any equitable remedy) of any kind, in connection
with any inaccuracy or breach of the type referred to in the preceding
sentence or in connection with any Financing Failure (except that the Company
may seek to recover the Reverse Termination Fee if and when such Reverse
Termination Fee becomes payable by Parent to the Company pursuant to this
Section 8.3(f). For purposes of this Section 8.3(f), "Related Persons" shall
include: (i) the former, current and future directors, officers, employees,
agents, stockholders, Parent Representatives, Subsidiaries, Affiliates and

the Expiration Date with the same effect as though such representations and

extent that any of such representations and warranties expressly speaks only
as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be
true and correct as of such earlier date);

  

  

(ii) the representations and warranties in Section 3.3 shall be true and
correct in all respects (except for any de minimis inaccuracy), with the same
effect as though such representations and warranties had been made on and as

the Company contained in Section 3.13 of this Agreement shall have been true

true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Expiration Date
with the same effect as though such representations and warranties had been
made on and as of the Expiration Date (except for representations and
warranties that expressly speak only as of a specific date or time which need
only be true and correct in all material respects as of such date or time);

contemplated by this Agreement or the Support Agreements, illegal;
