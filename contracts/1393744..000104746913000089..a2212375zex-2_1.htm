otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, subject to the other provisions in this </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;9.5</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in

do not adequately compensate for, the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and

without duplication, if applicable, any Capped Damages which are awarded, such right to seek (or receive) specific enforcement shall be immediately terminated and extinguished, and (iii)&nbsp;the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. </FONT></P>
