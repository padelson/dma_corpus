The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed 

        

with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as
is agreed by the Parties and specified as the Effective Time in the
Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

 Section 2.4 _ Effect of the Merger._ From and after the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, Liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, Liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 2.5 _ Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws_. 

  

  

 (a) Subject to _Section 6.12_, at the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws. 

  

 (b) Subject to _Section 6.12_, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in their entirety to contain the provisions set forth in the bylaws of Merger Sub until thereafter duly amended as provided therein, in the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or by applicable Laws. 

  

  

 Section 2.6 _ Directors and Officers_. 

  

  

 (a) Subject to applicable Law, each of the Parties hereto shall take all necessary action to ensure that the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation effective as of, and immediately following, the Effective Time shall consist of the members of the board of directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and with applicable Law. 

  

 

    
ARTICLE III 
_CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES 
_

  

 Section 3.1 _ Conversion of Securities._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the stockholders of the Company or Merger Sub, the following shall occur: 

  

  

 (a) _ Conversion Generally._ Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (i) any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_, and (ii) any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted, subject to _Section 3.2(d)_, into the right to receive $3.75 in cash, payable to the holder thereof, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares shall thereafter represent only the right, upon surrender of such Certificates in accordance with _Section 3.2_, to receive the Merger Consideration without interest therefor. 

  

      

  

 (b) _ Cancellation and Recapitalization of Certain Shares._ Each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof. Each share of Company Common Stock owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent, Merger Sub, any Affiliates of Parent, or any Company Subsidiary shall remain outstanding and shall become that number of shares of the Surviving Corporation that bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation as the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent, Merger Sub or such Subsidiary, as applicable, bore to the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) _ Merger Sub._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (d) _ Adjustments._ If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, solely by reason of any stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination, exchange or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period or any other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such change and to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action. 

  

  

 Section 3.2 _ Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

  

 (a) _ Paying Agent._ At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent, the identity and the terms of engagement of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _ARTICLE III_ , through the Paying Agent, cash in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration payable in connection with the Merger pursuant to _Section 3.1_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ are referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Paying Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.1_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this _ARTICLE III_ , (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 3.1(a)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.1_, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. 

  

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures._ Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail 

  

      

  

to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Certificates_ ," it being understood that any references herein
to "Certificates" shall be deemed to include references to book-entry
account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock) and whose shares of Company Common Stock have been converted into the
right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1 _(i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, in each case, in
customary form and with such other provisions as the Company and Parent may
reasonably agree. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions (or, if
such shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the
entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on
a book-entry account statement), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, subject
to deduction for any required withholding Tax, which such holder has the
right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate, to be mailed, made available for collection
by hand or delivered by wire transfer, as elected by the surrendering holder,
within five (5) Business Days following the later to occur of (i) the
Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agent\'s receipt of such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof), and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration payable to holders of Certificates. The Paying Agent shall
accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. In the event that the Merger Consideration is to be paid
to a Person other than the Person in whose name any certificate is issued,
the Merger Consideration may be issued to such other Person if the Certificate
representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration or, subject to compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL, the
right to demand to be paid the "fair value" of the shares represented thereby
as contemplated by _Section 3.3_.

  

 (c) _ Further Rights in Company Common Stock._ All Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. 

  

 (d) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation as the general creditor therefor for payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. 

  

 (e) _ No Liability._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any share of Company Common Stock shall not have been surrendered or transferred immediately prior to the date on which any Merger Consideration in respect thereof 

  

      

  

would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such Merger Consideration in respect of such share of Company Common Stock
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such share of Company Common Stock
who has not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE III_ with respect thereto
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of such
holder\'s claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof.

  

 (f) _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. 

  

 (g) _ No Further Dividends._ No dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates. 

  

 (h) _ Withholding._ Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold or cause to be deducted and withheld from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, including _Section 3.5_, such amounts as Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold taxes pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code unless the Company shall have delivered to Parent and Merger Sub a Certification by the Company that meets the requirements of Treasury Regulation 1.897-2(h)(1)(i). 

  

  

 Section 3.3 _ Dissenters\' Rights._ Notwithstanding _Section 3.1(a)_, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. Any payments required to be made with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be made by Parent (and not the Company or Merger Sub). The Company will give Parent (i) prompt written notice of any demand for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawals of such demands, and any other communications received by the Company in respect of the demand, withdrawal, or perfection of appraisal rights and (ii) the opportunity to conduct jointly all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock under the DGCL. The Company will not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any Dissenting Shares or settle or offer to settle any such demands. 

       

                                     

    

 Section 3.4 _ Stock Transfer Books._ After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. If Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided for in _Section 3.1(a)_, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates. 

  

 Section 3.5 _ Company Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company Performance Share Units and Company Phantom Share Awards._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Company Action._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions (including through an action of the Company Board or a duly authorized committee thereof) as are required to give effect to the treatment of the Company Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company Performance Share Units and Company Phantom Share Awards as contemplated by this _Section 3.5_. 

  

 (b) _ Company Options._ At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be cancelled and terminated, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Option, and converted into the right at the Effective Time to receive, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock previously subject to such Company Option, less any required withholding Taxes in accordance with _Section 3.2(h)_ (the " _Option Cash Payment_ ,"); provided that if the exercise price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the per share Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled and terminated without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. As of the Effective Time, all Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment, if any. 

   

 (c) _ Company Restricted Stock._ As of the Effective Time each share of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested and all restrictions thereon shall lapse (except that such Company Restricted Stock that is earned based on the achievement of performance goals (as opposed to based on the passage of time) (the " _Performance-Based Company Restricted Stock_ ") shall instead become earned and vested in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements) and shall be cancelled and terminated, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any share of Company Restricted Stock, and converted into the right at the Effective Time to receive, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Restricted Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes in accordance with _Section 3.2(h) _(the " _Restricted Stock Payment_ "), payable pursuant to Section 3.5(e) (except that with respect to such Performance-Based Company Restricted Stock, unless the Company and the holder thereof otherwise agree, the Restricted Stock Payment in respect thereof shall instead become payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreements), subject, however, to any rights of such holder pursuant to _Section 3.3_. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Restricted Stock (including the Performance-Based Company Restricted Stock) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of 

  

      

  

shares of Company Restricted Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Restricted Stock Payment
pursuant to this _Section 3.5(c)_.

   

 (d) _ Company Performance Share Units and Company Phantom Share Awards._ At the Effective Time, each of the Company Performance Share Units and Company Phantom Share Awards that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including but not limited to any time-based performance share units awarded to any individual employed full-time by the Company as of the date of this Agreement as a result of the vesting of performance-based performance share units, shall vest in full (to the extent unvested, except that such Company Performance Share Units or Company Phantom Share Awards that is earned based on the achievement of performance goals (as opposed to based on the passage of time) (each such performance-based Company Phantom Share Award shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Performance-Based Company Phantom Share Award_ ") shall instead become earned and vested in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements) and shall be cancelled and terminated, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any such Company Performance Share Unit or Company Phantom Share Award, respectively, and converted into the right at the Effective Time to receive, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Share Unit award or Company Phantom Share Award, respectively, and (ii) the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes in accordance with _Section 3.2(h) _(the " _Stock-Based Awards Payment_ "), payable pursuant to _Section 3.5(e) _(except that with respect to such Performance-Based Company Phantom Share Awards, unless the Company and the holder thereof otherwise agree, and except as set forth on _Section 3.5(d) _of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Stock-Based Awards Payment in respect thereof shall instead become payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreements). As of the Effective Time, all Company Performance Share Units and Company Phantom Share Awards (including the Performance-Based Company Phantom Share Awards) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of such Company Performance Share Unit and Company Phantom Share Award shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Stock-Based Awards Payment pursuant to this _Section 3.5(d)_. 

   

 (e) Unless a later time for payment is expressly provided in this _Section 3.5_, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company Performance Share Units and Company Phantom Share Awards the cash payments described in this _Section 3.5_, less any required withholding Taxes in accordance with _Section 3.2(h)_, promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Effective Time.

_

  

 With respect to any Section of this _ARTICLE IV_ , except (i) as disclosed in the Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 or in any Company SEC Filings filed subsequent to such Form 10-K but prior to the date of this Agreement, but excluding any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section and any general statements which, in each case, are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature (it being understood that any matter disclosed in such Company SEC Filings shall be deemed to be disclosed in a section of the Company Disclosure Letter only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure in such Company SEC Filings that such disclosure is applicable to such section of the Company Disclosure Letter) or (ii) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company\'s representations and warranties with respect to any Company Joint Venture or Magnox Company shall 

        

be deemed made only to the Knowledge of the Company (except that the
representations and warranties with respect to Magnox Companies in _Section
4.7_ shall not be deemed made only to the Knowledge of the Company):

With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has provided to Parent a true and complete copy of (i) such Company Benefit Plan including any amendments thereto (or, if not written, a written summary of its material terms), (ii) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) and all schedules thereto filed with the IRS or other Governmental Entity, if applicable, (iii) the most recent actuarial report or valuation, schedule of contributions or other financial statement, if applicable, (iv) the most recent determination or opinion letter, if any, issued by the IRS or other Governmental Entity and any pending request for such a letter, and, in respect of the UK DB Plans only, any material correspondence with the UK pensions regulator, (v) the most recent nondiscrimination tests performed under the Code, if applicable, (vi) each trust deed or agreement, group annuity contract, summary plan description, in respect of the UK DB Plans only, set of plan rules, if any, and any updates or amendments to the same, and (vii) all guarantees, letters of credit, funding agreements or other similar support arrangements which apply to that Company Benefit Plan. 

  

 (b) Save in respect of the UK DB Plans, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is or has at any time in the last six years been the employer or connected or associated with the employer (as those terms are used in the UK Pensions Act 2004) of a UK defined benefit pension plan. 

  

 (c) The Liabilities (actual and contingent) of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Magnox Companies in respect of the UK Magnox Plans are indemnified by a Governmental Entity, and in the event that the Magnox Parent Body Agreement is terminated, none of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries will have any Liability (actual or contingent) in respect of the UK Magnox Plans at that time and the new provider and successful bidder and the Magnox Companies will be responsible for any such Liability. No contribution notice or financial support direction has been issued (or has been threatened to be issued) by the UK Pensions 

  

      

  

Regulator against the Company or any Company Subsidiary in relation to any of
the UK DB Plans and, to the Company\'s Knowledge, no circumstances exist or
have existed at any time which could give rise to the issue of such a
contribution notice or financial support direction. None of the principal
employer, the trustees or the UK Pensions Regulator have notified the Company
or any Company Subsidiary that it/they intend to wind up any of the UK DB
Plans in whole or in part without the consent of the Company or the relevant
Company Subsidiary and, to the Company\'s Knowledge, no act, event
or omission has occurred which may lead to the winding up of any of the UK DB
Plans.

  

 (d) Each Company Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable Law, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code. There are no pending, or to the Company\'s Knowledge, threatened investigations by any Governmental Entity, termination proceedings, legal actions or other claims (except routine claims for benefits payable under the Company Benefit Plans) against or involving any Company Benefit Plan, the assets of any of the trusts under such Company Benefit Plans or the sponsor or administrator of any of the Company Benefit Plans, or against any fiduciary of the Company Benefit Plans, or asserting any rights to or claims for benefits under any Company Benefit Plan, other than any such investigations, proceedings, legal actions or claims that would give rise to any material Liability of the Company, and, to the Company\'s Knowledge, there are no facts that could give rise to any material Liability of the Company in the event of any such action. 

  

 (e) Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) no Company Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan, a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of ERISA and the Code), or other pension plan subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and (ii) none of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains, contributes to or has an obligation (contingent or otherwise) to contribute to, or has sponsored, maintained, contributed to or had an obligation (contingent or otherwise) to contribute to a Multiemployer Plan, multiple employer plan or other pension plan subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such Liability, including, without limitation, any Liability to a Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal therefrom. Except as stated in the immediately preceding sentence, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to incur any Liability to a Multiemployer Plan in the event of a complete withdrawal therefrom on the Closing Date. 

  

 (f) Where the Code is applicable, each Company Benefit Plan (excluding the UK DB Plans) intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, and the trust (if any) forming a part thereof, has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS as to its qualification under the Code and to the effect that each such trust is exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code. In respect of each Company Benefit Plan that is otherwise intended to be tax qualified, the relevant Governmental Entity has confirmed this tax status. In the case of all Company Benefit Plans covered by this section, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of such determination, opinion letter or registration that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such qualification or tax-exempt status. 

   

 (g) No prohibited transaction (as described in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, other than a transaction that is exempt under a statutory or administrative exemption) has occurred with respect to any Company Benefit Plan which would reasonably be expected to result in any material Liability to the Company. To the Company\'s Knowledge, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any other fiduciary for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any indemnity obligation has any material Liability for breach of fiduciary duty 

  

      

  

where one exists or any other failure to act or comply in contravention to a
contractual or legislative duty in connection with the administration or
investment of the assets of any Company Benefit Plan.

  

 (h) All contributions (including all employer contributions and employee salary reduction contributions) required to have been made under any of the Company Benefit Plans as of the date of this Agreement have been made in all material respects by the due date thereof (including any valid extension), or, if not yet due, have been properly reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company Financial Statements. 

  

 (i) None of the Company Benefit Plans provide for post-employment life or health insurance, or other welfare benefits coverage for any current or former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as may be required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_ ") or other applicable Law. Each of the Company, any Company Subsidiary and any ERISA Affiliate which maintains a "group health plan" within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code has complied in all material respects with the notice and continuation requirements of Section 4980B of the Code, COBRA, Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA. 

  

 (j) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has a Contract, plan or commitment to create any additional Company Benefit Plan or to modify any existing Company Benefit Plan, except to the extent required by applicable Law. No employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has a contractual right to a defined benefit pension benefit in respect of service following the Effective Time. 

  

 (k) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have withheld and paid all amounts required by Law or by agreement to be withheld from the wages, salaries, and other payments to employees, officers, director or consultants thereof, and are not liable for any arrears of wages or any Taxes or any penalty for failure to withhold or pay such amounts, except for any failure which would not be reasonably expected to result in material Liability to the Company. 

  

 (l) Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(l)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) will, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (i) entitle any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enhanced severance or termination pay, change in control or similar payments or benefits, (ii) result in, cause the accelerated vesting or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any such employee, officer, director or consultant, (iii) trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, or increase the cost of, any Company Benefit Plan or (iv) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any Company Benefit Plan. 

  

 (m) Other than payments or benefits that may be made to the persons listed in _Section 4.10(m)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby (alone or in combination with any other event) by any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Company Benefit Plan or other compensation arrangement could be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). 

  

 (n) Each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained and operated in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code or an available exemption therefrom. All 

  

      

  

Company Options have been granted at per share exercise price that is at
least equal to the fair market value of a share of the underlying Company
Common Stock as of the date the Company Option was granted, as determined in
accordance with applicable Law, including Section 409A of the Code.

  

 (o) The assets of each Company Benefit Plan are sufficient to satisfy its Liabilities (current and contingent), or the benefits provided by the Company Benefit Plan are fully insured. 

  

 (p) Except for the UK DB Plans, no UK employee benefit trust has been established for the benefit of the employees, former employees, or dependents of employees or former employees, of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

The Guarantee is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms (subject to the Enforcement Exceptions), and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under such Guarantee. 

  

 Section 5.9 _ Ownership of Company Common Stock._ None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their "affiliates" or "associates" (each, as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) is, or at any time during the last three (3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. 

  

 Section 5.10 _ Information Supplied._ None of the written information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. 

  

 Section 5.11 _ Solvency._ No transfer of property is being made, and no obligation is being incurred, by Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries. Assuming (a) the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article IV, disregarding any references to "Knowledge," "Material Adverse Effect," "materiality" or similar qualifications contained in such representations and warranties, (b) compliance by the Company of its covenants set forth in this Agreement, (c) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_, and (d) the most recent financial forecasts and business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries made available to Parent prior to the date hereof have been prepared in good faith on assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable, the Surviving Corporation will, after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, any alternative financing and the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and all amounts required to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.5_, any payment or refinancing of any outstanding Indebtedness of the Company contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing Commitments, the repayment of the Financing Commitment, the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the payment of all related fees and expenses, be Solvent at the Effective Time. As used in this _Section 5.11_, the term " _Solvent_ " means, at the Effective Time, (a) the Present Fair Salable Value of the assets of the Surviving Corporation exceeds all of its Liabilities, contingent or otherwise, as of such date, (b) the Surviving Corporation will be able to pay 

        

its debts as they become absolute and mature, in the ordinary course of
business, taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be received by
it and the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or in respect of its
indebtedness and (c) the Surviving Corporation does not have, or have access
to, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the business
in which it is engaged, in each case after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this _Section 5.11_, "debt"
means Liability on a claim, and "claim" means (a) any right to payment,
whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal,
equitable, secured or unsecured, and (b) any right to an equitable remedy for
breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to
payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to
judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured
or unsecured. " _Present Fair Salable Value_ " means the amount that may be
realized if the aggregate assets of the Surviving Corporation (including
goodwill) are sold as an entirety with reasonable promptness in an arm\'s
length transaction under then prevailing conditions for the sale of comparable
business enterprises.

  

 Section 5.12 _ Foreign Ownership._ Parent and Merger Sub or, if applicable, the Guarantor, are in compliance with Sections 103d and 104d of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, as applicable, and the NRC\'s regulations in 10 C.F.R. § 50.38, including the foreign ownership, control and domination provisions of such sections of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the NRC\'s regulations, and Parent and Merger Sub have no reason to believe that they are owned, controlled or dominated by foreign persons or entities (as such terms are interpreted and applied by the NRC), in contravention of the standards set forth in 103d and 104d of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the NRC\'s regulations in 10 C.F.R. § 50.38, as applicable to Part 50 licensees. 

  

 Section 5.13 _ Parent Ownership of Company Securities._ Parent, the Guarantor and their respective Subsidiaries do not beneficially own (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) any shares of Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire Company Common Stock or other securities of, or any other economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Company. 

   

 Section 5.14 _ No Other Representations or Warranties._ Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that it has, to its own satisfaction, conducted its own independent review and analysis of the business, assets, condition and operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. In connection with entering into this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub has relied upon the results of its own investigation and analysis. Each of Parent and Merger Sub also acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has relied upon any representations or warranties of any nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to the Company. In connection with the due diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and Merger Sub have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its business and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business plans, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or business plans).

 (ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect to such bona fide written Acquisition Proposal; 

    

 _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to taking any action described in

 (i) (A) publicly withhold or withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to withhold or withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Recommendation or otherwise publicly repudiate the adoption, approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Company Board or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) adopt, approve, publicly declare advisable or recommend or publicly propose to adopt, approve, declare advisable or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, (C) allow the Company Recommendation to be excluded from the Proxy Statement, (D) fail to reject (or, if requested by Parent, fail to publicly recommend against) any Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business Days after such Acquisition Proposal is publicly announced, or (E) if a tender or exchange offer relating to equity securities of the Company is commenced by a Person unaffiliated with Parent, fail to send to the Company\'s security holders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Act, within ten (10) Business Days after such tender or exchange offer is first published, a statement disclosing that the Company Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer (any action described in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D) or (E), a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or 

  

 (ii) adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to execute or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

this _Section 6.4(e)_ or (2) an Intervening Event occurs and is continuing,
and (B) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, it is necessary to take such action in order to comply
with the directors\' fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company

 (iii) following the end of the five (5) Business Day period described above in _Section 6.4(e)(ii)_, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel and taking into account the Tender Offer, any receipt of the Loan Amendments, changes to this Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the Guarantee proposed in writing by Parent and Merger Sub in response to the Change of Recommendation Notice or otherwise, that (A) such Company Adverse Recommendation Change in light of such Intervening Event is necessary to comply with the Company Board\'s fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law or (B)(1) such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (2) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that it is necessary to take such action in order to comply with the directors\' fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. 

    

If (x) there is any material change in the circumstances of such Intervening
Event or another Intervening Event occurs, or (y) any amendment to the
financial terms or any other amendment of such Superior Proposal is made, the
Company shall deliver a new Change of Recommendation Notice to Parent and
Merger Sub, and the Company shall be required to comply again with the
requirements of this _Section 6.4(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that references to the five (5) Business Day period above shall be deemed to
be references to a three (3) Business Day period.

  

 (f) From and after the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours), advise Parent and Merger Sub of receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, the terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or request (including the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal), and shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent and Merger Sub of any amendments to any such Acquisition Proposal or request, (ii) keep Parent fully and promptly informed of the status and material details (including

or request, and (iii) provide to Parent promptly after receipt or delivery
thereof copies of all material correspondence and other written material sent
or provided to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any Company
Representative from any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions

of the foregoing, the Company shall promptly notify Parent if the Company
determines to begin providing information to any Third Party related to an
Acquisition Proposal or determines to begin discussions with a Third Party
related to an Acquisition Proposal.

  

 (g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.4_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly through the Company Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, in each case if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel, failure to so disclose would violate applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that all actions taken or agreed to be taken by the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof shall comply with the provisions of this _Section 6.4_ (including the provisions related to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change).

 (i) Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.4_ by any Company Representative or Affiliate of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.4_ by the Company. 

  

  

 Section 6.5 _ Reasonable Best Efforts._ 

  

  

 (a) Subject to _Section 6.4_, the Parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ to be satisfied, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, consents and approvals (including those specified below) from Governmental Entities or other persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity or other persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions, including the Merger, to be performed or consummated by such Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining Order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and any other transactions to be performed or consummated by such Party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and to carry out fully the purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing in _Section 6.5(a)_, each of the Parties hereto shall promptly (and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the date that this Agreement is executed) (i) make and not withdraw (except with the prior written consent of 

  

      

  

the other Party) its respective filings under the HSR Act, and the Parties
shall request early termination of the statutory waiting period with respect
thereto, and (ii) make in good faith such joint filings with CFIUS as shall
be appropriate pursuant to Exon-Florio, with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and thereafter use their
reasonable best efforts to make any other required submissions and
substantially comply with any additional requests for information by any
antitrust authority or CFIUS, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable
make all filings or notifications to any other foreign or multijurisdictional
body that are required under any applicable Antitrust Laws, or that are
otherwise agreed by the Parties to be advisable in connection with the
completion of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub agree to take promptly any and all
steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain
all consents under any Antitrust Laws that may be required by any foreign or
U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Entity, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the Parties to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, as promptly as
practicable, including committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, trust, or otherwise, the sale or disposition of such assets
or businesses as are required to be divested in order to avoid the entry of,
or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Order, that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, Parent will take any and
all actions necessary in order to ensure that (x) no requirement for any non-
action by or consent or approval of the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission or other foreign or U.S. Governmental
Entity with respect to any Antitrust Laws, (y) no decree, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or any other Order in any suit or
proceeding with respect to any Antitrust Laws, and (z) no other matter
relating to any Antitrust Laws would preclude consummation of the Merger by
the End Date. Each Party will bear its own costs for the preparation and
filing of any notification and report required by any Antitrust Law or
response to any request for additional information.

  

 (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing in _Section 6.5(a)_, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent, as applicable, shall make the filings necessary to obtain the Required Regulatory Approvals, other than the NRC Consents required to be obtained with respect to the NRC Licenses and the NDA Consent.

The Parties shall use, their reasonable best efforts to obtain such consents as promptly as practicable. Each Party will bear its own costs of the preparation of any such filings and NRC fees shall be equally shared by the Parties. Thereafter, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another to facilitate NRC review of the application by providing the NRC staff with such documents or information that the NRC staff may require any of the Parties to provide or generate. Notwithstanding anything to the 

  

      

  

contrary contained in this Agreement, with respect to the NRC Consents
required to be obtained with respect to the NRC Licenses, no Party nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall agree to, or be required to agree to, any
conditions, provisions, amendments, agreements, Liabilities, or terms to which
any of paragraphs (i) through (iii) of _Section 7.1(e)_ apply, taken
individually or in the aggregate.

The Company shall use, and shall cause ES EU to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain the NDA Consent within sixty (60) days after the date of this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the following in _Section 6.5(h)_, the Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt by the Company or ES EU of any comments from the NDA (or the staff of the NDA) or any request of the NDA (or the staff of the NDA) with respect to the NDA Consent, and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company, ES EU and the Company Representatives, on the one hand, and the NDA (or the staff of the NDA), on the other hand.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, with respect to the NDA Consent, no Party nor any of their respective Affiliates shall agree to, or be required to agree to, any conditions, provisions, amendments, agreements, Liabilities, or terms to which any of paragraphs (i) through (iii) of _Section 7.1(e)_ apply, taken individually or in the aggregate. 

  

 (f) Each of Parent and the Company shall give (or shall cause its respective Subsidiaries (as well as, in the case of the Company, the Magnox Companies) to give) any notices to Third Parties, and Parent shall use, and cause each of its Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in its efforts, and the Company shall use, and cause each of its Subsidiaries and the Magnox Companies to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any Third Party consents not covered by _Section 6.5(a)_ through _Section 6.5(e)_ above that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger or to avoid the loss as the result of the Merger of any material Permit, Company Material Contract or Government Bid to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any Magnox Company is a party and for which an award has not been issued prior to the date of this Agreement. Each Party will bear its own costs incurred in connection with this _Section 6.5(f)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than a Governmental Entity) with respect to the Merger, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Magnox Companies shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such Person and (ii) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation. 

  

      

                                     

   

  

 (g) Each of Parent and the Company shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its Affiliates, and its or its Affiliates\' directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to any Third Party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information and advice of counsel, each of Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective Representatives, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Third Party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or any of its other Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. 

  

  

 Section 6.6 _ Financing._ 

  

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing, so long as the Loan Amendments are not in full force or effect, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things that are necessary or advisable to: 

    

 (i) maintain in full force and effect the Financing Commitments in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof (subject to the approval right of the Company in clause (a)(v) below, and further, subject to clause (b) below); provided that Parent may (A) replace or amend the Debt Commitment Letters so long as such replacement or amendment would not adversely impact or delay in any material respect the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger or the Financing, and (B) amend (including pursuant to a joinder agreement or an amendment and restatement) the Debt Commitment Letters to add Debt Financing Sources that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof;

efforts to seek to enforce its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters in

 (v) not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or consent to any waiver of any condition, provision or remedy under, or replacement of (except as provided in _Section 6.6(b)_), any of the Financing Commitments or any related fee letters, without the prior written consent of the Company, if such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement; 

    

 (A) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing from that contemplated in the Financing Commitments;

As long as the Loan Amendments are not in full force or effect, Parent shall
not release or consent to the termination of the obligations of the Debt
Financing Sources, except for assignments and replacements of an individual
lender under the terms of or in connection with the syndication of the Debt
Commitment Letters or as otherwise contemplated by _Section 6.6(a)(i)_ or
_Section 6.6(b)_. Any reference in this Agreement to (x) " _Financing_ "

amended or modified in compliance with this _Section 6.6(a)_, and (y) "
_Financing Commitments_ ," " _Debt Commitment Letters_ " or " _Equity
Commitment Letter_ " shall include such documents as amended or modified in
compliance with this _Section 6.6(a)_.

  

 (b) If the Loan Amendments are not in full force or effect and any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated in the Financing Commitments, Parent shall promptly so notify the Company and shall, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, use reasonable best efforts to arrange and to obtain alternative financing commitments from alternative sources on terms not less favorable taken as a whole than those contained in the Financing Commitments to Parent and Merger Sub and in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (the " _Alternative Financing_ "), and to obtain a new financing commitment letter with respect to such Alternative Financing (an " _Alternative Financing Commitment_ ") which shall replace the existing Financing Commitments or such unavailable portion thereof. Parent shall promptly provide a true and complete copy of each Alternative Financing Commitment (and any fee letters or engagement letters redacted in a manner consistent with _Section 5.6(a)_) to the Company.

notice or other communication from any party to a Financing Commitment
regarding the existence of a material dispute or disagreement between or among
any parties to any Financing Commitment that could reasonably cause a
condition to the Financing Commitments not to be satisfied; and (iii) if for
any reason Parent or Merger Sub has reasonably determined in good faith that
it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Financing
Commitments (including the flex provisions).

  

 (d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the Loan Amendments, the Financing or any Alternative Financing, nor the completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by the Financing or any Alternative Financing, is a condition to the Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the receipt of the Loan Amendments or the availability of the Financing or any Alternative Financing, or the completion of any such issuance, subject to the applicable conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_, _Section 7.2_ and _Section 9.5_.

In addition, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change or event having a Company Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.8 _shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to any Party.

 Section 6.9 _ Publicity._ The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company.

 Section 6.10 _ Employee Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) During the one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to Continuing Employees a base salary or wage rate at least equal to the Continuing Employees\' base salary or wage rate in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation and benefits being provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject always to any powers to amend, terminate or renegotiate a collective bargaining agreement, with respect to Continuing Employees whose terms and conditions of employment are governed by a collective bargaining agreement, Parent will honor such terms and conditions of employment and continue benefits as set forth therein. 

  

 (b) Without limiting paragraph _(a)_ of this _Section 6.10_, (i) during the one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to Continuing Employees who experience a termination of employment severance benefits that are no less than the severance benefits that would have been provided under a Company Benefit Plan to such employees upon such a termination of employment immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

      

  

 (c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, and determination of level of benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under the compensation and benefit plans, programs, agreements and arrangements of Parent or its Affiliates, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary and Affiliate thereof providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), including for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits under New Plans, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Closing, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under a corresponding Company Benefit Plan; provided, however, that no such service shall be recognized to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan that constitutes a group health plan made available to any Continuing Employee after the Effective Time, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such exclusions or requirements would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year that includes the Effective Time to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year to the extent such amounts would have been taken into account under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (d) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any current or former employee, director or other service provider of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including rights in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company Benefit Plan or any New Plan or rights to continued employment or service with Parent or its Affiliates, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary and Affiliate thereof, (ii) be construed as an amendment, waiver or creation of or limitation on the ability to terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any New Plan, or (iii) limit the ability of Parent or its Affiliates, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary and Affiliate thereof to terminate the employment of any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. 

  

  

 Section 6.11 _ Resignation of Directors._ At the Closing, except as otherwise may be agreed by Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent the contingent resignation of all of the members of the Company Board who are in office immediately prior to the Effective Time (and to the extent requested by Parent, from any member of the board of directors (or any equivalent) of each Company Subsidiary), which resignations shall be effective at the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 6.12 _ Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification and Insurance._

required by: (x) the Company Certificate of Incorporation or the Company By-
laws (or equivalent organizational or governing documents of any Company
Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement) and (y) any indemnification agreement of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or other applicable contract as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions referenced in subsections (i)(x) and (y) above in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Parties.

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors\' and officers\' liability coverage of the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' insurance policies and the Company\'s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company\'s existing policies, for an aggregate amount not to exceed eighteen times the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement for the DandO Insurance. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Company\'s current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company\'s existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Indemnified Parties who are insured under the Company\'s DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company\'s current insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for any such insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement for the DandO Insurance. 

  

 (c) The Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 6.12_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.12_. The provisions of this  _Section 6.12_ are intended to be for the benefit of and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Party and his or her successors, heirs or representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.12_. 

  

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 6.12_ shall be in addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of Company Subsidiary, or under any applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the Company or any Company Subsidiary. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.7_ to the contrary, this _Section 6.12_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or 

  

      

  

representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.12_.

  

  

 Section 6.13 _ Section 16 Matters._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such further actions, if any, as may be necessary or appropriate to ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 6.14 _ Merger Sub._ Parent will take all actions necessary to (a) cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or make any investments or incur or guarantee any Liabilities other than as contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE VIII 
_TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER 
_

 (a) by mutual written consent of each of Parent and the Company; 

  

 (b) by either Parent or the Company: 

    

 (i) if the Merger shall not have been consummated by 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on October 7, 2013 (such date, as it may be extended as provided below, the " _End Date_ "); provided, however, that (A) the End Date may be extended by Parent (by written notice thereof to the other Parties), from time to time, for an additional aggregate period of time not to exceed three (3) months if all other conditions to consummation of the Merger are satisfied or capable of then being satisfied and the sole reason that the Merger has not been consummated by the then-current End Date is that one or more conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_, _Section 7.1(c) _, _Section 7.1(d)_, or _Section 7.1(e)_, in each case relating to the NRC Consents or the NDA Consent, has not been satisfied, and (B) the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any Party if the failure of such Party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, the failure to act 

   

      

   

in good faith or the failure to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement has been
a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the Merger to be
consummated on or before such date;

  

 (ii) if any Order or other action of any Governmental Entity having competent jurisdiction is entered permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order or other action has become final and nonappealable; provided, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to a Party if the issuance of such final, non-appealable Order was primarily due to the failure of such Party, and in the case of Parent, including the failure of Merger Sub, to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or 

  

 (iii) if the Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof at which the Merger has been voted upon; 

    

 (c) by the Company: 

    

 (i) if (A) there exists a breach of any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement such that the closing condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ would not be satisfied or (B) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement to be complied with by Parent or Merger Sub such that the closing condition set forth in _Section 7.3(b)_ would not be satisfied, and, in the case of either (A) or (B), such breach is incapable of being cured on or before the End Date or is not cured by Parent within thirty (30) calendar days after Parent receives written notice of such breach from the Company; provided that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ if, at the time of such termination, there exists a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement that would result in the closing conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_, as applicable, not being satisfied; 

  

 (ii) if all of the conditions in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions, which by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing) and Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within two (2) Business Days after the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that during such period of two (2) Business Days following the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_ and for twenty-four (24) hours thereafter, no Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_; or 

  

 (iii) if prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, (A) the Company Board has determined to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.4(e)_ and (B) the Company has complied in all material respects with _Section 6.4_; provided, that prior to or concurrently with termination pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_, the Company pays the Company Termination Fee to Energy Capital Partners Management II, LP or its designee in accordance with _Section 8.2(b)(i)_.

Company within thirty (30) calendar days after the Company receives written
notice of such breach from Parent or Merger Sub; provided that Parent shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(d)(i)_ if, at the time of such termination, there exists a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement that would result in the closing conditions set
forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b) _, as applicable, not being
satisfied;

  

 (ii) if (A) the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) the Company Board shall have failed to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting or to use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and to obtain the Stockholder Approval, and such failure shall have been a material breach of _Section 6.2(d)_, or (C) the Company Board fails to reaffirm publicly the Company Recommendation to the Company\'s stockholders to vote in favor of the Merger within ten (10) days of Parent\'s written request for such reaffirmation (or if the End Date is less than ten (10) days from the receipt of such request from Parent, by the close of business on the penultimate Business Day preceding the End Date); 

  

 (iii) if the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement; or 

  

 (iv) if the Company shall have materially breached any provision of _Section 6.4_. 

   

  

 Section 8.2 _ Effect of Termination; Termination Fee._ 

  

  

 (a) _ Effect of Termination Generally._ In the event that this Agreement is terminated and the Merger abandoned pursuant to _Section 8.1_, written notice thereof shall be given to the other Party or Parties, specifying the provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and of no effect without liability on the part of any Party hereto (or any of its Representatives), and all rights and obligations of any Party hereto shall cease, except for the rights and obligations contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, the Guarantee and the provisions of _Section 6.3(b)_, this _Section 8.2(a), Section 8.2(b), Section 8.2(c), Section 8.2(d), ARTICLE I _and _ARTICLE IX_ , which shall survive any termination of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that if (i) such termination results from an Intentional Breach committed prior to such termination and (ii) all of the conditions to Closing contained in _Section 7.1 _and, in the case of a termination by the Company, _Section 7.2 _and, in the case of a termination by Parent, _Section 7.3_, have been satisfied (other than those conditions, which by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), then (A) no such termination shall relieve the Party who committed such Intentional Breach of any liability for actual damages incurred by the other Parties in an amount not to exceed Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000), which damages resulted from such Intentional Breach (such actual resulting capped damages are referred to herein as the " _Capped Damages_ "), and (B) the other Parties shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in equity to seek to recover damages in an amount not to exceed the Capped Damages; _provided, further_ , that if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii) _and the reason that Parent and Merger Sub failed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is that the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters is not available (other than as a result of breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub), then the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Group against the Parent Group shall be to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(i) _and any related costs, expense and interest pursuant to _Section 8.2(d)_. 

  

 (b) _ Company Termination Fee and Expenses._ 

    

 (i) (A) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_, the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Energy Capital 

   

      

   

Partners Management II, LP or its designee prior to or concurrently with such
termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts
designated by Parent or its designee (or by check if Parent fails to
designate an account), and (B) in the event that this Agreement is terminated
by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, _Section 8.1(d)(iii) _ or
_Section 8.1(d)(iv)_, the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to
Energy Capital Partners Management II, LP or its designee promptly, but in
any event within one (1) Business Day after the date of such termination, by
wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent
or its designee (or by check if Parent fails to designate an account).

  

 (ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (A) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or (B) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i) _, and subject to the delivery by Parent of an invoice and reasonable documentation thereof, the Company shall reimburse all of Parent\'s Reimbursable Expenses to Energy Capital Partners Management II, LP or its designee promptly, but in any event within one (1) Business Day after the date of such termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent or its designee (or by check if Parent fails to designate an account); _provided_ , that in the event the Company has paid or caused to be paid Parent\'s Reimbursable Expenses, and a Company Termination Fee is thereafter payable, the Company Termination Fee otherwise payable shall be reduced by the amount of such Parent\'s Reimbursable Expenses which are actually reimbursed. 

  

 (iii) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, (B) the Company receives or has received an Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party after the date hereof, which Acquisition Proposal is publicly disclosed either (I) in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_, before the End Date, (II) in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, before the Company Stockholders Meeting (or such later date as such meeting is postponed or adjourned), or (III) in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_, before such termination, and (C) within twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal with any Person other than Parent or its Affiliates, then the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Energy Capital Partners Management II, LP or its designee promptly, but in any event within one (1) Business Day following the date on which the Company enters into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent or its designee; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_, the references to "ten percent (10%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)." 

  

 (iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion or to pay Parent\'s Reimbursable Expenses on more than one occasion. 

  

 (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but subject to _Section 9.5_ either (but not both) (A) Parent and Merger Sub\'s right to seek to recover damages in an amount not to exceed the Capped Damages pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ or (B) Energy Capital Partners Management II,  LP\'s right to receive payment from the Company of the Parent\'s Reimbursable Expenses and/or Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees agents, affiliates or assignees (collectively, the " _Company Group_ ") for all losses and 

   

      

   

damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of either the Company Termination
Fee or any Capped Damages which are awarded, the Company Group shall not have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby (except that the Company
shall also be obligated with respect to _Section 8.2(d)_ and, in the event
that Parent\'s Reimbursable Expenses are paid by the Company but not the
Company Termination Fee, _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_).

    

 (c) _ Parent Termination Fee._ 

    

 (i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the Parent Termination Fee to the Company promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business Days following such termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts designated by the Company. 

  

 (ii) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent and Guarantor be obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether pursuant to this Agreement or the Guarantee. 

  

 (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but subject to _Section 8.2(a)_ and _Section 9.5_, the Company\'s right to receive payment from Parent of the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(i)_ shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub, the Guarantor, the Debt Financing Sources or any of their respective former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees (excluding the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Magnox Companies and any Company Joint Ventures, collectively, the " _Parent Group_ ") for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, the Parent Group shall not have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , (A) that Parent shall also be obligated with respect to _Section 8.2(d)_ and (B) if the proceeds of the Debt Financing are available to be drawn down at the Closing pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters or if the failure of the proceeds of the Debt Financing to be available to be drawn down at the Closing pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters is the result of a breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, and all the conditions under _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) and the Closing does not occur, then (x) Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee not later than the second (2nd) Business Day after the Company terminates the Agreement; and (y) the Company shall be entitled to payment from Parent of an amount equal to the Company\'s aggregate losses, if any, in excess of the Parent Termination Fee resulting from Parent or Merger Sub\'s Intentional Breach of this Agreement (but, together with the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee, subject to the Capped Damages). In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek or obtain any recovery or judgment in excess of the Parent Termination Fee against the Debt Financing Sources, including for any type of damage relating to this Agreement; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall in any way limit or modify any Debt Financing Source\'s obligations to Parent or Merger Sub under the Debt Commitment Letters. 

   

      

   

 (iv) If any payment of the Parent Termination Fee is made pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(i)_, unless payments are owed pursuant to clause (y) of _Section 8.2(c)(iii)_(B), than such payment (A) shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim which the Company would be entitled to assert against Parent, any member of the Parent Group (and such payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy) or any of their respective assets with respect to any such termination of this Agreement, and (B) shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any such termination of this Agreement based upon any breach or misrepresentation of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, the failure to obtain Debt Financing or the failure by Parent to effect the Closing regardless of whether the Debt Financing is available. For the avoidance of doubt, Company is entitled to make a claim for both the Parent Termination Fee and for liabilities or damages arising from any breach or misrepresentation of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, the failure to obtain Debt Financing or the failure by Parent to effect the Closing regardless of whether the Debt Financing is available. 

    

 (d) _ Acknowledgement._ Each Party acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee, Parent\'s Reimbursable Expenses, or Parent Termination Fee are payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.2(c)_ are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) without the agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ and, in order to obtain such payment, either Parent, Energy Capital Partners Management II, LP or the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a judgment against any Party for the payment of any amount set forth in this _Section 8.2_, such paying Party shall pay the prevailing Party\'s costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law. 

  

 (e) _ Fees and Expenses._ Subject to _Section 6.5_ and except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.2_, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such Expenses. If the Closing occurs, except as provided in _Section 3.2(b)_, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, all documentary, sales, use, real property transfer, registration, value added, transfer, stamp, recording and similar Taxes, fees, and costs together with any interest thereon, penalties, fines, costs, fees, additions to tax or additional amounts with respect thereto incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall file all Tax Returns related thereto, regardless of who may be liable therefor under applicable Law. 

  

 (f) In no event shall either Party be entitled to seek or obtain any recovery or judgment in excess of the Capped Damages which are awarded against the Party or any of their respective assets, and in no event shall either Party be entitled to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind against the other Party, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby and 

  

      

  

thereby (including, any breach by either Party), the termination of this
Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any
such breach, termination or failure; provided, however, this _Section 8.2(f)_
shall not limit the right of the Parties to seek specific performance of this
Agreement pursuant to, and subject to the limitations in, _Section 9.5_ prior
to the termination of this Agreement; and provided, further, in no event will
either Party be entitled to receive more than one of the following
remedies: (i) a grant of specific performance as provided in _Section 9.5_,
(ii) the payment of all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee, in the
case of termination by the Parent, or the Parent Termination Fee, in the case
of termination by the Company, under _Section 8.2_, and (iii) a recovery of
damages in an amount not to exceed the Capped Damages.

  

  

 Section 8.3 _ Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and, subject to the proviso in _Section 8.4_, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. 

  

 Section 8.4 _ Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that after approval of the Agreement by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment that, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such stockholders may be made without further stockholder approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section 8.2(c)(iii)_, this _Section 8.4_, _Section 9.5_, _Section 9.6_ and _Section 9.7_ (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the substance of such Sections) may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that adversely affects the rights of the Debt Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Debt Financing Sources. 

  

    
ARTICLE IX 
_GENERAL PROVISIONS 
_

  

 Section 9.1 _ Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties._ The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement and any certificate delivered pursuant hereto by any Person shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as provided in _Section 8.2_, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, as the case may be, except that this _Section 9.1 _shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time or after termination of this Agreement, including those contained in _Section 6.10 _and _Section 6.12_. 

   

 Section 9.2 _ Notices._ Any notices or other communications required or permitted under, or otherwise given in connection with this Agreement, shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) when delivered, if delivered in person, (b) upon confirmation of receipt, when transmitted by facsimile transmission or by electronic mail, (c) on receipt, after dispatch by registered

 Section 9.3 _ Severability._ If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible. 

  

 Section 9.4 _ Entire Agreement._ This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent Disclosure Letter, Company Disclosure Letter and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto), the Financing Commitments, the Guarantee and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the Parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. 

        

 Section 9.5 _ Specific Performance._ 

  

  

 (a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, subject to the other provisions in this _Section 9.5_, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Subject to the other provisions in this _Section 9.5_, each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that, (i) each Party shall be entitled to seek to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, notwithstanding the potential availability of any monetary remedy set forth in _Section 8.2_, (ii) the provisions set forth in _Section 8.2_ (A) are not intended to, and do not adequately compensate for, the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any Party\'s right to seek specific enforcement, but that upon the payment of either the Parent Termination Fee and, without duplication, if applicable, any Capped Damages which are awarded, such right to seek (or receive) specific enforcement shall be immediately terminated and extinguished, and (iii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing in _Section 9.5(a)_, the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, in each case, solely with respect to causing the Parent and the Merger Sub to, or to directly, cause the Equity Financing to be funded shall be subject to the requirements that: (A) all conditions in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_  (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but each of which shall be capable of being satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied, and remain satisfied, at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, and Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_, (B) either (i) the Loan Amendments shall be in full force and effect, (ii) the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing has been funded, or (iii) the full proceeds of the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing would be available to be drawn down by the Parent at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are funded, then it would take all actions that are within its control to cause the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2_ to occur. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding _Section 9.5(a)_, the right of the Company to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable relief, in each case, solely with respect to causing Parent and Merger Sub to use reasonable best efforts to enforce the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters, which may include a demand that the Merger Sub and Parent file one or more lawsuits against the sources of Debt Financing to fully enforce such sources\' obligations thereunder and the Parent\'s and the Merger Sub\'s rights thereunder, shall be subject to the requirements that: (A) all conditions in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but each of which shall be capable of being satisfied on the Closing Date) have been satisfied, and remain satisfied, at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Debt Financing to be funded, and Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.2_, (B) all conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters (other than the receipt of the Equity Financing, 

  

      

  

any conditions that are within the control of Parent or Merger Sub, and those
conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date,
but each of which shall be capable of being satisfied on the Closing Date)
have been satisfied and remain satisfied, (C) the Loan Amendments shall not be
in full force and effect and (D) the Company has irrevocably confirmed
in writing that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing
and the Debt Financing are funded, then it would take all actions that are
within its control to cause the Closing pursuant to _Section 2.2_ to occur.

  

 (d) Each of the Parties hereby further waives (i) any defense in any action for specific performance in accordance with this _Section 9.5_ that a remedy at law would be adequate or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. 

  

 (e) For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue (i) a grant of specific performance as provided in this _Section 9.5_, (ii) the payment of all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee under _Section 8.2(c)_, and/or (iii) a recovery of damages in an amount not to exceed the Capped Damages, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive more than one of the remedies described in clause (i), (ii) and (iii). 

  

  

 Section 9.6 _ GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ 

  

  

 (a) This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties hereto acknowledge and irrevocably agree that any claim, suit, controversy, dispute, action or proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, in which any Debt Financing Source is a party arising out of, or in any way relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. 

  

 (b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if (but only if) the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) for the purpose of any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, and each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to such action or proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware state or federal court. 

  

 (c) Each of the Parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself or its property, in the manner provided for in _Section 9.2(a)_, _(c)_ and  _(d)_ , and nothing in this _Section 9.6_ shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law, (ii) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if (but only if) the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat

such Debt Financing Source without its prior written consent). The
