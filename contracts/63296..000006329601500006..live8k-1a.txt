connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby for
which any of the Subsidiaries, Empire or Matthews will be responsible.

2.21	Contingencies.  Except for:
(a) liabilities which are disclosed and fully provided for in the most recent
balance sheet referred to in Section 2.05,

(b) liabilities incurred in the usual and ordinary course of business of the
Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of such balance sheet and on or prior to
the Closing Date,

(c) liabilities disclosed in Schedule 2.21 to this Agreement, and

(d) liabilities relating to Environmental Laws,

none of the Subsidiaries has any material liabilities or obligations (absolute
or contingent, known or unknown, asserted or unasserted), including without
limitation contingent liability for the performance of any obligation by any
other Person.



<PAGE> 21
2.22	Condition of Tangible Assets.  To the knowledge of York, no tangible
assets of the Subsidiaries which are material to the operations of the
Subsidiaries are reasonably likely to be unavailable for use (except to the
extent scheduled to be repaired or replaced) in the ordinary course of
business during  the next three months succeeding the date of this Agreement
or except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect.  Subject to the
previous sentence and the representations and warranties set forth elsewhere
in this Agreement, the assets of each of the Subsidiaries shall be accepted by
Empire and Matthews in its "AS IS" "WHERE IS" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS" condition,
with any and all faults, defects and conditions, without representation or
warranty of any kind, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including,
without limitation, any warranty as to habitability, suitability,
merchantability, condition or fitness, fitness for a particular purpose or
fitness for any purpose.

2.23	Inventory.  The inventory of each of the Subsidiaries is taken and shall
be accepted by Empire and Matthews in its "AS IS" "WHERE IS" AND "WITH ALL
FAULTS" condition, with any and all faults, defects and conditions, without
representation or warranty of any kind, express, implied, statutory or
otherwise, including, without limitation, any warranty as to habitability,
suitability, merchantability, condition or fitness, fitness for a particular
purpose or fitness for any purpose.

2.24	Books and Records. Except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect,
the minute books and other similar records of each of the Subsidiaries contain
a true and complete record of all actions taken at all meetings and by all
written consents in lieu of meetings of such Subsidiary's stockholders, boards
of directors, and committees thereof.  Such books and records have been
maintained in accordance with good business and bookkeeping practices.

2.25	Warranties.  The accrual for warranty related expenses as of December
31, 2000 reported in York's audited financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2000, adequately reflects an amount required for satisfaction of
warranty claims due in respect of goods sold or services provided by each
Subsidiary prior to such date, except as would not have Material Adverse
Effect.  Such provision has been established in accordance with GAAP, except
as would not have Material Adverse Effect.  No Subsidiary has agreed to
provide any express product or service warranties other than standard
warranties, the terms of which York has made available to Empire and/or to
Matthews and identified as such Subsidiary's standard warranties.

2.26	Restrictions on Business Activities.  There is no agreement, commitment,
judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon any of the Subsidiaries or
to which any of the Subsidiaries is a party which has or could reasonably be
expected to have the effect of prohibiting or materially impairing any
business practice of such Subsidiary, any acquisition or transfer of property
by York or by such Subsidiary or the conduct of business by such Subsidiary,
as currently conducted.

                                   Covenants

4.01	Employees.  (a)  None of Matthews, Empire nor York intends this
Agreement to create any rights or interests, except as between Matthews,
Empire and York, and no present, former or future employee of Matthews, Empire
or York shall be treated as a third party beneficiary by, in or under this
Agreement.  Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the ability of Matthews or
Empire to hire or terminate the employment of employees.

(b)	York shall be liable for compliance with the WARN Acts insofar as they
relate to any facilities closing, mass layoff or similar event which occurs
before the Closing.  Matthews and Empire shall be liable for compliance with
the WARN Acts insofar as they relate to any facilities closing, mass layoff or
similar event which occurs upon or after the Closing.

(c)	For at least two (2) years following the Closing, Matthews or Empire, as
the case may be, agrees to provide employee benefits to the Subsidiaries'
employees which are in the aggregate, no less favorable than such benefits
that were provided by York and the Subsidiaries as of the Closing.  For these
purposes, the Subsidiaries' employees will be given credit for years of
service with York, its subsidiaries and their predecessors for all employee
benefit purposes, with the exception of the defined benefit pension plans of
Matthews.

4.02 Financial Statements. York will cause its auditors to provide to Matthews
and to Empire, on or prior to sixty five (65) days after the date hereof, the
audited financial statements of the Subsidiaries which are necessary for
Matthews to meet its reporting obligations under Items 2 and 7 of Form 8-K
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Matthews shall pay to
York one half of the fees of York's auditors in connection with the same.

4.03 Tax Matters.  Matthews and York agree to furnish or cause to be furnished
to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, access
to books and records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns, and making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for any
audit by any taxing authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any Tax Return.  Matthews and York will retain
all books and records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Subsidiaries for
a period of at least six (6) years following the Closing.  Matthews and York
will cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding
related to Taxes and each will execute and deliver such powers of attorney and
other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this Section 4.03.

4.04 Environmental Response.  (a)  Matthews and Empire acknowledge that the
York Bronze Real Property, the OMC Real Property and the Sub 1 Real Property
are subject to on-going environmental investigation, remediation, and/or other
corrective work and response actions undertaken pursuant to the Colonial Guild


<PAGE> 25
Merger Documents (as hereinafter defined) and the OMC Merger Documents (as
hereinafter defined) (collectively, "Environmental Response Activities").
Matthews and Empire consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
with the understanding that the Environmental Response Activities set forth on
Schedule 4.04 have been identified as needing to be completed after the date
of this Agreement by the Shareholder Representatives (as that term is defined
in the Colonial Guild Merger Documents) and the Shareholders (as that term is
defined in the OMC Merger Documents) in accordance with the terms of such
agreements and subject to the rights and remedies of York thereunder.

(b)	The Matthews Group (as defined below) grants the Shareholder
Representatives, the Shareholders and York and their respective contractors,
subcontractors, and representatives, such reasonable access to that portion of
the York Bronze Real Property, the OMC Real Property and the Sub 1 Real
Property as is necessary for the purpose of performing their respective
obligations with respect to Environmental Response Activities as described in
the Colonial Guild Merger Documents and OMC Merger Documents.  The parties
agree to reasonably cooperate with respect to the work to be completed on the
York Bronze Real Property, the OMC Real Property and the Sub 1 Real Property,
such that Matthews and Empire use reasonable efforts not to interfere with,
hinder or prevent the rights and obligations of York, the Shareholder
Representatives and the Shareholders to complete the Identified Environmental
Response Activities (defined below), and York uses reasonable efforts to
minimize the disruption of Matthews' operations.  Matthews and the
Subsidiaries agree to designate in writing to York the name and contact
information of its representative to participate in the process of consulting
and, if desired by York, approving any ongoing Environmental Response
Activities under the Colonial Guild Merger Documents and/or the OMC Merger
Documents at the York Bronze Real Property, the OMC Real Property and/or the
Sub 1 Real Property.  The Matthews Group agrees to promptly provide comments
to any work proposed by York, the Shareholder Representatives or the
Shareholders; provided, however, that any proposed changes by the Matthews
Group to the work to be performed at the York Bronze Real Property, the OMC
Real Property and/or the Sub 1 Real Property shall be in conformance with the
requirements of the Colonial Guild Merger Documents or OMC Merger Documents
and shall be reasonable in view of York's rights and remedies thereunder.  If
no comments are provided within ten business days of the Matthews Group's
receipt of such proposed Environmental Response Activities, it will be
presumed that the Matthews Group has agreed to the proposed Environmental
Response Activities.

(c)	York agrees to continue after the Closing to perform its obligations
under the Colonial Guild Merger Documents and the OMC Merger Documents with
respect to the Environmental Response Activities, consisting only of (i) any
claimed Shareholders' Environmental Escrow Obligations as that term is defined
in the Colonial Guild Merger Documents, (ii) the preparation of a storm water
pollution prevention plan and obtaining a storm water general permit from the
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission for the OMC Real Property and
(iii) the matters set forth in the Response Activities Agreement of the OMC
Merger Documents (collectively, the "Identified Environmental Response
Activities"), including the handling of any escrows or payments to
environmental consultants or attorneys and any arbitration or litigation, now
pending or hereafter commenced, arising from such Identified Environmental
Response Activities, until the conclusion thereof, except to the extent caused
by or attributable to any breaches by the Matthews Group of any of their
obligations hereunder.  York shall have the responsibility to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Shareholder Representatives and the
Shareholders to complete the Identified Environmental Response Activities but


<PAGE> 26
only to the extent it can avail itself of its rights under the Colonial Guild
Merger Documents and OMC Merger Documents and their related escrows to fund
the same.  As used herein, the standard for completion of any Identified
Environmental Response Activities shall be (i) the obtaining of any necessary
permits or other authorizations with respect to the storm water issue at
Bryan, Texas, or (ii) receipt of "Completion Evidence" as that term is defined
in the Colonial Guild Merger Documents or "Closure" as that term is defined in
the OMC Merger Documents.

(d)	If, but only if, the Matthews Group requests any Environmental Response
Activities other than or in addition to the Identified Environmental Response
Activities to be performed at the York Bronze Real Property, the OMC Real
Property or the Sub 1 Real Property, (i) the Matthews Group will contact York,
and the parties agree to reasonably cooperate to have York present the same to
and process the same with the Shareholder Representatives and the
Shareholders, with York having only the obligation to use commercially
reasonable efforts, at no cost or expense to York, to undertake the
responsibility for advocating the Matthews Group position to the Shareholder
Representatives or the Shareholders within, and participating in, the dispute
resolution procedures under such documents, (ii) the Matthews Group agrees to
be bound by any decision reached under the dispute resolution procedures of
the Colonial Guild Merger Documents or the OMC Merger Documents without any
recourse against York and (iii) the Matthews Group agrees to defend, hold
harmless, and indemnify York against all claims, demands, disputes, losses,
damages, costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys' and other
professionals' fees) associated with or arising from the assertion of the
Matthews Group's position at its or their request as described above and
resolution of disputes with respect to the same.

(e) Other than with respect to its agreement to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take the actions described above with respect to the
Identified Environmental Response Activities affecting the York Bronze Real
Property, the OMC Real Property, the Sub 1 Real Property or the Subsidiaries,
York shall bear no responsibility, liability, obligation or duty to the
Matthews Group or any other Person for (i) any particular results with respect
to such Environmental Response Activities, (ii) any disbursement from the
Escrow Deposit (as defined under the Colonial Guild Merger Documents)
authorized by York for any proposed Environmental Response Activities approved
or deemed approved by the Matthews Group hereunder, (iii) any reimbursement
from the Escrow Deposit to any party to the Colonial Guild Merger Documents,
or (iv) the amount of the Escrow Deposit and its sufficiency for any
Environmental Response Activities.

For purposes of this Agreement, the "Colonial Guild Merger Documents" shall
include the Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into as of February 17, 1998
by and among York, Colonial Acquisition Corp., and Colonial Guild, Ltd., and
all other documents and amendments associated with that transaction, including
without limitation the Escrow Agreement, Access Agreement, and Letter
Agreement and the "OMC Merger Documents" shall include the Agreement and Plan
of Merger entered into as of December 18, 1998 by and among The York Group,
Inc., York Acquisition Corp.  III, OMC Industries, Inc., and Ben Hardeman and
Nancy Hardeman, and all other documents and amendments associated with that
transaction, including without limitation, the Fixed Fee Remediation Contract
and the Response Activities Agreement and the Pollution Legal Liability Select
Policy issued to York by American International Specialty Lines Insurance
Company (the "OMC Insurance Policy").  York shall remain the named insured
under the OMC Insurance Policy.



<PAGE> 27
For purposes of this Section 4.04, the "Matthews Group" shall mean,
collectively, Matthews, Empire and (after the Closing) the Subsidiaries.

4.05 Post-Closing Corporate Governance of Subsidiaries.  Matthews, Empire and
York agree as follows with respect to corporate governance and related matters
applicable to each of the Subsidiaries after the Closing Date:

(a) The Board of Directors of each of the Subsidiaries shall consist of two
(2) persons, one (1) designated by Empire (the "Empire Designee") and one (1)
designated by York (the "York Designee" and, together with the Empire
Designee, the "Designees").  Either party may remove its Designee from time to
time, and any vacancy created by the removal, resignation, death or disability
of a director shall be filled by the party designating the applicable
Designee.  Thomas Crawford shall be the initial York Designee and David Kelly
shall be the initial Empire Designee.  Each of Empire and York shall, and York
shall cause York Bronze and OMC to, vote all shares of voting stock in the
Subsidiaries in favor of such Designees.

(b) Neither Empire nor York shall transfer any of its shares of York Bronze
Common Stock or OMC Common Stock without the prior written consent of the
other party.  Any purported transfer without such consent shall be null and
void.

(c) Neither Empire nor York shall permit or suffer to exist any Lien on or
affecting its shares of York Bronze Common Stock or OMC Common Stock.

(d) Effective as of the Closing Date, the officers of York Bronze, OMC and Sub

time to time by action of the Board of Directors of the respective
Subsidiaries.

(e) Effective as of the Closing Date, Matthews and Empire shall cause the
Subsidiaries to be covered by the insurance policies and programs of Matthews
and its Affiliates.

(f) The Boards of Directors of York Bronze and OMC shall, and York and Empire
as the shareholders of York Bronze and OMC shall, at the earliest time as
either such shareholder deems appropriate, take steps to liquidate and
dissolve York Bronze and OMC (the "Liquidation") and, in connection with such
Liquidation, to cause Empire to assume all Liabilities of York Bronze and OMC
(other than Liabilities relating to Excluded Assets), to distribute the Sub 1
Common Stock and the Sub 1 Preferred Stock to Empire and to distribute the
Excluded Assets and the $7,790,000 paid to York Bronze and the $1,100,000 paid
to OMC under the Asset Purchase Agreement, including any interest and
dividends earned or accrued thereon after the closing of the Asset Purchase
Agreement, to York.  Each party shall execute such documents and take such
actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the Liquidation in an
orderly fashion.

(g) In the event that the liquidating distributions to York upon the
Liquidation of York Bronze and OMC (the "Actual York Liquidation Proceeds") is
not greater than or equal to $8,890,000, plus any interest that would have
accrued thereon from the date of closing the Asset Purchase Agreement to the
date of receipt by York of such proceeds (the "Expected York Liquidation
Proceeds"), Matthews and Empire shall make a cash payment on the date of the
liquidating distributions to York in an amount equal to the Expected York
Liquidation Proceeds less the Actual York Liquidation Proceeds.  The parties
acknowledge that until the Liquidation occurs, the $8,890,000 paid to York


<PAGE> 28
Bronze and OMC under the Asset Purchase Agreement shall be invested at the
discretion of York.

4.06	Uses of Names. (a) Effective from and after the Closing and up to
December 31, 2001, York hereby grants the Matthews Group the nonexclusive,
royalty-free right to use (without right of sublicense) the name "York Bronze"
any derivative thereof and any corporate symbols or logos related thereto, but
only in connection with the conduct and operation of the businesses of the
Subsidiaries, provided, however, that the Matthews Group shall not represent
or hold itself out as representing York and provided further, however, that
the Matthews Group shall indemnify and hold harmless York from and Adverse
Consequences incurred by York as a result of the Matthews Group's use of such
names or symbols or logos.

(b) The Matthews Group acknowledges that, except for the limited right granted
by this Section, the Matthews Group has no right or interest in the name
"York" or any trade name, service name, trademark or service mark or logos
relating thereto.  Except as set forth in this Section, the Matthews Group
shall not use any name, trade name, service mark, trademark, service mark or
any related logos or symbols incorporating "York" in any manner whatsoever.
Prior to December 31, 2001, the Matthews Group shall take all such action as
is necessary to cause the Subsidiaries to make all filings as necessary to
change their corporate names to names that do not contain "York" or any
substantially or confusingly similar name or reference, and thereafter, the
Matthews Group shall take all such action as is necessary to cause the
Matthews Group and its Affiliates to cease using any name, trade name,
trademark or service mark or any related logos or symbols incorporating "York"
in any manner whatsoever.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article V, if there is any breach
or inaccuracy of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of York
contained herein, or if any third party alleges facts that, if true, would
mean that such a breach or inaccuracy existed, and provided that the Parent
Group delivers to York, pursuant to Section 5.04 hereof, a claim for
indemnification with respect to such alleged breach or inaccuracy, then York
shall indemnify the Parent Group, from and against all Adverse Consequences
that the Parent Group has suffered caused by, resulting from, arising out of
or relating to such breach or inaccuracy through and after the date of such
claim.  For purposes of this Agreement, the "Parent Group" shall mean either
or both of Matthews and Empire.

(b) York's obligations under Section 5.02(a) shall be subject to the following
limitations:
(i) York shall not have any liability to the Parent Group for Adverse
Consequences for any breach of the representations, warranties or covenants
under this Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement to the extent the
aggregate amount of all such Adverse Consequences for which York would
otherwise be liable under this Agreement and under Section 5.02(a) of the
Asset Purchase Agreement exceeds Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000);

(ii) York shall not have any liability to the Parent Group for Adverse
Consequences for any breach of the representations or warranties under this
Agreement or under the Asset Purchase Agreement unless and until the aggregate
amount of all such Adverse Consequences relating thereto for which York would,
but for this Section 5.02(b)(ii) or Section 5.02(b)(ii) of the Asset Purchase
Agreement, be required to indemnify the Parent Group exceeds on a cumulative
basis an amount (the "Basket Amount") equal to Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000), at which point York, subject to the further terms, conditions and
limitations of this Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement, shall
indemnify the Parent Group for all Adverse Consequences exceeding the Basket
Amount;

(iii) if a reserve (in the form of an accrued Liability or an offset to an
asset or similar item) was reflected in the Financial Statements relating to
any matter for which the Parent Group would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement, then the
calculation of the Parent Group's Adverse Consequences in respect of such
matter shall be reduced by the full amount of the reserve as reflected in
Financial Statements; and

(iv) the obligations to indemnify and hold the Parent Group harmless shall
terminate as to each representation, warranty and covenant when each such
representation, warranty or covenant terminates; provided, however, that such

<PAGE> 30
(c)	York's obligation to indemnify Parent Group under Section 5.02(a) shall
not be affected or limited by Parent Group's obligation to indemnify York and

5.03 Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of York.  (a)  Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Article V, Matthews and Empire shall have the
following indemnification obligations:
(i) 	If there is any breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Parent Group contained herein, or if any third
party alleges facts that, if true, would mean that such a breach or inaccuracy
existed, and provided that York deliver to the Parent Group pursuant to
Section 5.04 hereof a claim for indemnification with respect to such alleged
breach or inaccuracy, then Matthews and Empire, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify York from and against all Adverse Consequences that York has
suffered or may suffer caused by, resulting from, arising out of or relating
to such breach or inaccuracy through and after the date of such claim,

(ii)	Matthews and Empire, jointly and severally, shall indemnify York and its
Affiliates for any fines, penalties, and Adverse Consequences relating to any
recission (but not attorneys' fees) resulting from, arising out of or relating
to any violation of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement and
any other agreements among the parties or their Affiliates.

(iii)	Empire and Matthews, jointly and severally, shall indemnify York and its
Affiliates from and against any and all Liabilities and other Adverse
Consequences resulting from, arising out of or relating to (1) the Liquidation
of OMC and/or York Bronze, (2) any attempt by a third party to recover any
amount of the Actual York Liquidation Proceeds from York or its Affiliates,
and (3) any failure by Sub 1 or any of its Affiliates to fully pay, perform or
otherwise satisfy any of the Assumed Liabilities as defined in the
Contribution, Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of May 21, 2001;
provided, however, that Matthews and Empire shall not be required to indemnify
York and its Affiliates under this Section 5.03(a)(iii)(3) if and only to the
extent that (and only for so long as) Parent Group is entitled to
indemnification from York under Section 5.02(a).

(b) The Parent Group's obligations under Section 5.03(a)(i) shall be subject
to the following limitations:
(i) The Parent Group shall not have any liability for Adverse Consequences for
any breach of representations, warranties or covenants under Section
5.03(a)(i) of this Agreement or Section 5.03(a)(i) of the Asset Purchase
Agreement to the extent the aggregate amount of all such Adverse Consequences
for which the Parent Group would otherwise be liable under Section 5.03(a)(i)
of this Agreement and under Section 5.03(a)(i) of the Asset Purchase Agreement
exceeds Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000);

(ii) The Parent Group shall not have any liability for Adverse Consequences
for any breach of the representations or warranties under Section 5.03(a)(i)
of this Agreement and Section 5.03(a)(i) of the Asset Purchase Agreement
unless and until the aggregate amount of all such Adverse Consequences
relating thereto for which the Parent Group would, but for this Section
5.03(b)(ii) or Section 5.03(b)(ii) of the Asset Purchase Agreement, be
required to indemnify York exceeds on a cumulative basis a Basket Amount equal
to Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000), at which point, the Parent Group,
subject to the further terms, conditions and limitations of this Agreement and


<PAGE> 31
the Asset Purchase Agreement, shall indemnify York for all Adverse
Consequences exceeding the Basket Amount; and

(iii)	the obligations to indemnify and hold York harmless shall terminate as
to each representation, warranty and covenant when each such representation,
warranty or covenant terminates, provided, however, that such obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to
which York shall have, prior to the expiration of the applicable period,
previously made a claim by delivering an indemnification notice pursuant to
Section 5.04 and in compliance with the requirements therefor, but only with
respect to the content of, and on the basis set forth in, such indemnification
notice.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the Asset
Purchase Agreement, the limitations set forth in Sections 5.03(b)(i), (ii) and
(iii) above shall not apply to or otherwise limit in any manner the
obligations of Matthews and Empire under Sections 5.03(a)(ii) and (iii) above.
5.04 Notice of Claim for Indemnification.  No claim for indemnification
hereunder shall be valid unless notice of such claim is delivered to the
Parent Group (in the case of a claim by York) or to York (in the case of a
claim by the Parent Group) prior to or upon the date of expiration of the
representation, warranty or covenant pursuant to which such indemnification is
sought.  Any such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail, to the extent
known by the person giving such notice, the facts on which such claim is based
and the estimated amount of Adverse Consequences resulting therefrom.

5.05 Matters Involving Third Parties.  (a) If the Parent Group or York
receives notice or acquires knowledge of any matter which may give rise to a
claim by another Person and which may then result in a claim for
indemnification under this Article V, then (i) if such notice or knowledge is
received or acquired by the Parent Group, the Parent Group shall within twenty
(20) days notify York thereof, and (ii) if such notice or knowledge is
received or acquired by York, York shall within twenty (20) days notify the
Parent Group thereof; provided, however, that no delay in giving such notice
shall diminish any obligation under this Article V to provide indemnification
unless (and then solely to the extent that) the party from whom such
indemnification is sought is prejudiced.  Thereafter, the party seeking
indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall deliver to the party from whom
such indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party"), within five
business days after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all
notices, correspondence and documents (including, without limitation, court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend against such claim
by another Person (the "Third Party Claim") with counsel of the Indemnifying
Party's choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as
(within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the
Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party) the Indemnifying Party notifies
the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the
Indemnified Party from and against all Adverse Consequences the Indemnified
Party may suffer caused by, resulting from, arising out of or relating to such
Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third
Party Claim actively and diligently.  Notwithstanding any acknowledgement made
pursuant to Section 5.05(b)(i), York shall continue to be entitled to assert
any defense to or limitation on its indemnification responsibility contained
in Section 5.02.



<PAGE> 32
(c)	So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with Section 5.05(b) hereof, (i) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, it being understood,
however, that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense, and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior consent
of the Indemnifying Party.  If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any
Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control the
defense, compromise or settlement of such matter, and all the parties hereto
shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim.  Such
cooperation shall include the execution of documents necessary to effectuate
any reasonable institutional controls that are required as part of a remedial
action approved by a Governmental Authority, retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
Records that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not compromise or
settle any Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party,
unless such compromise or settlement by the Indemnifying Party involves only
the payment of monetary damages by the Indemnifying Party and includes a full
release of the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to such Third
Party Claim.  If the Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable time after
receipt of an Indemnification Notice relating to a Third Party Claim, chooses
not to assume defense of a Third Party Claim or fails to defend such Third
Party Claim actively and diligently, the Indemnified Party will (upon further
notice) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of
such Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to
such Third Party Claim, on behalf of, and for the account and risk of, the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall have no right to
challenge the Indemnified Party's defense, compromise, settlement or consent
to judgment, subject to the limitations on the Indemnifying Party's
obligations pursuant to Section 5.02.  The foregoing notwithstanding, in the
event that the Indemnifying Party chooses not to assume defense of a Third
Party Claim or fails to defend such Third Party Claim actively and diligently,
but later chooses to assume defense of such Third Party Claim and gives notice
to the Indemnified Party of such assumption, the Indemnifying Party shall,
effective concurrently with the notice, control such defense, and the
Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior consent
of the Indemnifying Party.

5.06	Exclusive Remedy.  From and after the date hereof, the indemnification
provisions of this Article V shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement
(or any related agreements, certificates and other documents, except to the
extent otherwise expressly set forth therein) and no other remedy shall be had
pursuant to any contract, misrepresentation, fraud or other tort theory or
otherwise by Matthews or York and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, Affiliates, attorneys, consultants, successors and assigns,
all such remedies being hereby expressly waived to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law.  Without limitation, the procedures set forth
in this Article V constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Matthews and
York and their Affiliates arising out of any breach or claimed breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article II and Article III made as
of the date of this Agreement relating to events occurring on or prior to the
date hereof that become known to Matthews or York on, prior to or subsequent


<PAGE> 33
to the date hereof.  In furtherance of the foregoing, except with respect to
the rights of Matthews under this Agreement, Matthews hereby waives, from and
after the date hereof, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
any and all other rights, claims and causes of action it may have against York
and its Affiliates relating to the subject matter of this Agreement arising
under or based upon any federal, state, local or foreign Law or otherwise,
including, without limitation, such rights, claims and causes of action
Matthews may have against York under any Environmental Law or Worker Safety
Law (Statutory, Regulatory Common Law or otherwise) or CERCLA.

Closing, such Persons shall not, anywhere in North America, engage, directly
or indirectly, whether as principal or as agent, consultant, shareholder
(other than as a shareholder of York Bronze and OMC until the Liquidation
occurs), or otherwise, alone or in association with any other Person,
corporation or other entity, in any Competing Business.  For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Competing Business" shall mean the business of
manufacturing bronze urns, bronze niche units, or bronze memorial or
architectural products.  Competing Business shall exclude the use, marketing,
distribution and sale of bronze urns, bronze niche units and bronze memorial
and architectural products.

(c)	Remedies. In the event of a breach by any of York or its Affiliates of
the terms of this Section 7.11, Matthews and/or Empire shall be entitled, if
it or they shall so elect, to institute legal proceedings to obtain damages
for any such breach, or to enforce the specific performance of this Agreement
by such Person and to enjoin such Person from any further violation of this
Agreement and to exercise such remedies cumulatively or in conjunction with
all other rights and remedies provided by law.  York acknowledges, however,
that the remedies at law for any breach by it of the provisions of this
Agreement may be inadequate and that Matthews and/or Empire shall be entitled
to injunctive relief against it in the event of any breach.

(d)	Authorization to Modify Restrictions.  It is the intention of the
parties that the provisions of Section 7.11 hereof shall be enforceable to the
fullest extent permissible under applicable law, but that the unenforceability
(or modification to conform to such law) of any provision or provisions hereof
shall not render unenforceable, or impair, the remainder thereof.  If any
provision or provisions hereof shall be deemed invalid or unenforceable,
either in whole or in part, this Agreement shall be deemed amended to delete
or modify, as necessary, the offending provision or provisions and to alter
the bounds thereof in order to render it valid and enforceable.
