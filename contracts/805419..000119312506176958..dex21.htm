SECTION 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of Article

Effective Time, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions),
or at such other place or at such other date as the Acquiror and the Company
may mutually agree. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is
hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date". At the Closing, the parties
hereto shall execute and cause the articles of merger ("Articles of Merger")

the Articles of Merger and as is agreed to by the parties hereto, being the
"Effective Time") and shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the MGCL in connection with the Merger.

SECTION 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. From and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the
MGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at
the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and

and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of
the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.4 _Charter; Bylaws_. From and after the Effective Time, the charter
of the Merger Sub shall be the charter of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and applicable law. From and
after the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Merger Sub shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with
their terms, the charter of the Surviving Corporation and applicable law.



 

2 SECTION 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualify, and the officers of the Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until the earlier of their resignation or

SECTION 1.6 _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights
shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, so long as the provisions of Section 3-202(c)(1)(ii) of
the MGCL are applicable to the Merger.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

OF THE COMPANY AND THE MERGER SUB

SECTION 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Acquiror, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holders of any of the stock of the Company:

(a) _Merger Consideration_.

(i) Each issued and outstanding share of Sizeler Common Stock, outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive from Acquiror $15.10 in cash (payable in U.S. dollars), without
interest (such sum, the "Merger Consideration").

(ii) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Sizeler Common Stock, including
the Restricted Shares (as defined herein), outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Sizeler Common Stock (each, a
"Common Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.2.

(iii) Each issued and outstanding share of Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock
(as defined herein) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into the right to receive from Acquiror the Series B Cash
Consideration (as defined herein) (payable in U.S. dollars); _provided_ ,
_however_ that if the Series B Preferred Merger Approval



 

3 (as defined herein) is not obtained prior to the Effective Time, then each
issued and outstanding share of Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Series B Cash Consideration and
instead shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of Series B Preferred Stock of the Surviving Corporation,
which shall have terms consistent with the Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock
until thereafter redeemed or cancelled, whether upon liquidation of the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise, in accordance with the
Surviving Corporations Articles of Incorporation, as amended and
supplemented. The term "Series B Cash Consideration" means the sum of (x)
$25.00 plus (y) any accrued and unpaid dividends on a share of Series B
Preferred Stock to the Effective Time plus (z) an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of dividends that would have accrued on each such share of
Series B Preferred Stock between the Effective Time and May 10, 2007 had such
share remained outstanding through May 10, 2007. The term "Series B Merger
Approval" means approval of the Merger by the holders of at least two-thirds
of the outstanding shares of Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock, given in person
or by proxy and in writing or at a meeting.

(iv) If the Series B Preferred Merger Approval is obtained then as of the
Effective Time all shares of Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Sizeler Series B
Preferred Stock (each, a "Preferred Certificate") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Series B Cash
Consideration upon surrender of such certificate. Each Common Certificate and
Preferred Certificate is sometimes referred to in this Agreement as a
"Certificate."

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Sizeler Common Stock or Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon
shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger
Consideration and Series B Cash Consideration, as applicable, and any other
relevant provisions of this Agreement shall be equitably adjusted.

(b) _Stock of Merger Sub_. All issued and outstanding shares of common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of Common Stock, of the Surviving Corporation.



 

4 SECTION 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing, Acquiror and the Company shall
select a bank or trust company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent")
for payment of the Merger Consideration and the Series B Cash Consideration
(if the Series B Merger Approval is obtained prior to the Effective Time) upon
surrender of Certificates. On or before the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
deposit by wire transfer of cash immediately available funds, with the Paying
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Sizeler Common Stock and
Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article
II, the amount of cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in
exchange for outstanding shares of Sizeler Common Stock and for outstanding
shares of Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock (if any). If the Series B Merger
Approval is not obtained prior to the Effective time, then Acquiror shall not
deposit the Series B Cash Consideration. The cash delivered pursuant to this
Section 2.2(a) is hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The
Exchange Fund may not be used for any purpose that is not provided for
herein.

(b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration or the Series B Cash Consideration as
applicable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) a letter of transmittal in a form
prepared prior to the Effective Time and reasonably acceptable to the Company
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration or the Series B Cash
Consideration as applicable. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefore (i) in the case of a Common Certificate, a cash payment representing
the Merger Consideration for each share of Sizeler Common Stock represented
thereby, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article
II and (ii) in the case of a Preferred Certificate, a cash payment
representing the Series B Cash Consideration for each share of Sizeler Series
B Preferred Stock represented thereby (if the Series B Merger Approval has
been obtained prior to the Effective Time), which such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to this Article II, and, in each case the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Sizeler Common Stock or Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company prior to the Effective
Time, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Common Certificate and (if the Series B Merger Approval has
been obtained prior



 

5 to the Effective Time) each Preferred Certificate shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
surrender of such Certificate, the consideration into which the shares
theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant
to Section 2.1(a) together with the dividends, if any, which may have been
declared by the Company on the Sizeler Common Stock or the Sizeler Series B
Preferred Stock, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. The Acquiror and the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent in
connection with the Exchange Fund and the distributions therefrom.

(c)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates __._ If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the appropriate amount of the consideration into which the shares theretofore
represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section
2.1(a).

(d) _Withholding of Tax._ Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Sizeler Common Stock and
Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock such amount as Acquiror, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign law related to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by the Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be paid over to the applicable Governmental
Entity in accordance with applicable law.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Sizeler Common Stock or Sizeler Series B
Preferred Stock_. The Merger Consideration and Series B Cash Consideration
paid (if the Series B Merger Approval has been obtained prior to the Effective
Time) in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any
shares of Sizeler Common Stock and Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock shall be
deemed to have been paid (or delivered) in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Sizeler Common Stock and Sizeler Series
B Preferred Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on such shares of Sizeler Common Stock or Sizeler Series B Preferred
Stock prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective
Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Sizeler Common Stock or Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Sizeler Common Stock
or Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled as provided in this
Article II.



 

6 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Acquiror and any holder of
Sizeler Common Stock and Sizeler Series B Preferred Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and other similar laws) for payment of its claim for consideration specified
in this Agreement.

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Acquiror, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

SECTION 2.3 _Treatment of Company Options_.

(a) Subject to paragraph (c) below, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each outstanding right to acquire Sizeler Common Stock ("Company Options")
granted pursuant to the Companys 1996 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the
"Company Option Plan") whether or not then exercisable, shall fully vest,
contingent on the Closing. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
effect such vesting. At the Effective Time, each of the Company Options shall
be cancelled by the Company, and in consideration of such cancellation, the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, as soon as practicable
thereafter, an amount of cash from the Surviving Corporation equal to the
product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise price thereof and (B) the total number of shares of Sizeler
Common Stock subject to the Company Options to the extent such Company Options
shall not theretofore have been exercised (the "Option Amount") (such payment
to be net of applicable withholding taxes). Immediately after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit in a bank account an amount of
cash equal to the Option Amount for each Company Option then outstanding
(subject to any applicable withholding tax), together with instructions that
such cash be promptly distributed following the Effective Time to the holders
of such Company Options in accordance with this Section 2.3(a). At the
Effective Time, each Company Option with an exercise price equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration shall terminate, in accordance with its terms,
without payment of any consideration.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Sizeler Common
Stock subject to a right of reacquisition by the Company granted under the
Company Option Plan or the Companys 1994 Directors Stock Ownership Plan, as
amended through January 15, 2002 (the "Restricted Shares"), shall fully vest,
contingent on the Closing. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
effect such vesting and issuance.



 

7 (c) The Companys Board, or, if appropriate, any committee administering the
Company Option Plan, shall adopt such resolutions or take such actions as are
necessary to carry out the terms of this Section 2.3.

ARTICLE III 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Acquiror and Merger Sub as of
the date of this Agreement (except in the case of any representation or
warranty that by its express terms is made as of another specified date)
that, except as set forth on the corresponding section of the disclosure
schedule delivered by the Company to Acquiror and Merger Sub prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"):

SECTION 3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation and has the
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where
any such failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have
such power or authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, use or leasing of its assets and
properties, or the conduct or nature of its business, makes such
qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except for such failures to
be so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good standing which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

The term "Subsidiary" means any corporation or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, (i) of which the Company or any other
Subsidiary of the Company is a general partner (excluding partnerships, the
general partnership interests of which held by the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company do not have a majority of the voting interests in such
partnership) or (ii) at least a majority of the securities or other interests
of which having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of
the board of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to
such corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly owned or
controlled by the Company or by any one or more of its Subsidiaries, or by the
Company and one or more of its Subsidiaries.

The term "Company Material Adverse Effect" with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries means any state of facts, change, development, event, effect or
set of circumstances that is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse
to the business, operations, properties, financial condition, or assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
none of the following shall be deemed in and of themselves, either alone or in
combination, to constitute, and none of



 

8 the following shall be taken into account in determining whether there has
been a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) general economic or other changes
or developments in or affecting the industries or markets in which the Company
and its Subsidiaries operate (excluding for the avoidance of doubt, changes or
developments caused by Acts of God) to the extent that such changes or
developments do not have a disproportionate impact on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) changes in any laws or regulations or accounting
regulations or principles applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries. An
"Act of God" shall mean any storm, flood, freeze, hurricane, earthquake, fire
or explosion that causes property damage or destruction to the Company and or
its Subsidiaries in an amount equal to or greater than $7,500,000. 

SECTION 3.2 _Charter and Bylaws_. The Company has previously delivered or made
available to the Acquiror complete and correct copies of the Companys
charter (the "Charter") and bylaws (the "Bylaws"), and the charter and bylaws
(or other comparable documents) of each of its Subsidiaries, as currently in
effect.

SECTION 3.3 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 51,484,000
shares of Sizeler Common Stock and (ii) 2,516,000 shares of preferred stock,

clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflict, violation, Lien, breach,
default, loss, right, change or other occurrence which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the
performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder, and the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, do not and will
not require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by,

franchises from governmental and regulatory agencies required to conduct

Subsidiaries.

SECTION 3.9 _Employee Benefit Plans; Labor_.

13 (d) Except as disclosed in Section 3.9(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
none of the execution and delivery of, the stockholder approval of, the
performance by the Company of its obligations under, or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement, will (either alone or upon
occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) (i) constitute an event
under any Company Plan or any trust or loan related to any of those plans or
agreements that will or may result in any material payment, acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) result in the triggering or imposition of (A) any
material restrictions or limitations on the right of the Company or any of

such actions are pending or threatened.

SECTION 3.10 _Tax Matters_.

(a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have (i)
timely filed (taking into account any extension of time within which to file)
all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them in the manner provided by
law and all such filed Tax Returns were complete and accurate in all material
respects and (ii) paid all Taxes shown on such Tax Returns to be due
and payable. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (A) since December 31, 2005, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for
Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business and (B) no audits have
begun or been threatened in writing and no deficiencies for material Taxes
have been asserted or assessed or threatened in writing by a governmental
authority against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
the Company has established in its books and records reserves or accrued
liabilities or expenses that are adequate for payment of all Taxes for which
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is liable but are not yet due and
payable. No event has occurred, and condition or circumstance exists, which
presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the preceding
sentence will be imposed on the Company.

(b) Except as set forth on Section 3.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
or as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company



 

14 Material Adverse Effect, (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any liability for the Taxes of any person other than the Company or its
Subsidiaries either (A) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law) or (B) as a transferee or
successor, and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to, is bound by, or has any obligation under, any Tax sharing,
allocation, indemnity or similar agreement or arrangement (whether or not in
writing) that obligates it to make any payment computed by reference to the
Taxes, taxable income or taxable losses of another person.

(c) During the five year period ending on the date hereof, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries was a distributing corporation or a
controlled corporation in a transaction intended to be governed by Section 355
of the Code.

(d) The Company, (i) for each taxable year beginning with its taxable year
ended on December 31, 2005, has been subject to taxation as a real estate
investment trust within the meaning of the Code ("REIT") and has satisfied
the requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii) has operated since
December 31, 2005, and intends to continue to operate, consistent with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT, and (iii) has not
taken any action or omitted to take any action which would reasonably be
expected to result in a successful challenge by the Internal Revenue Service
to the Companys status as a REIT, and no such challenge is pending, or to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened. Each Subsidiary which is a
partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other entity other
than a corporation (i) has been since its formation and continues to
be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership or as an entity
that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes and not as a corporation
or an association taxable as a corporation and (ii) has not since the later of
its formation or the acquisition by the Company of a direct or indirect
interest therein, owned any assets (including, without limitation, securities)
that would cause the Company to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. Each
Subsidiary which is a corporation or treated as an association taxable as a
corporation and any person in which the Company owns 10% or more, by vote or
by value, of such persons securities, is and has been since its formation or
acquisition by the Company a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i)
of the Code, or is and has been a "taxable REIT subsidiary" under Section
856(l) of the Code.

(e) The Company is a "domestically-controlled REIT" within the meaning of
Section 897(h) of the Code.

(f) As a result of the consummation of the Merger, (i) the Merger Sub shall
have an aggregate adjusted basis in the Companys assets for U.S. federal
income tax purposes immediately after the Effective Time equal to the sum of
(A) the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration, (B) the aggregate amount
of the Series B Cash Consideration, and (C) the aggregate amount of the
Companys liabilities at the Effective Time and (ii) the amount of gain
recognized by the Company for federal income tax purposes upon the transfer of
its assets pursuant to the Merger will not exceed



 

15 the dividends paid deduction of the Company under Part IV of Subchapter G of
Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code for the taxable year which includes the
Closing Date and therefore, the Company will not be subject to any corporate-
level income tax in connection with any such recognized gain.

As used in this Agreement, the term (i) "Taxes" shall mean all federal, state,
local and foreign income, profits, franchise, license, transfer, recording,
gross receipts, environmental, customs duty, capital stock, severances,
stamp, payroll, sales, employment, unemployment, disability, use, property,

duties or assessments of any nature whatsoever, together with all interest,
penalties and additions imposed with respect to such amounts and any interest
in respect of such penalties and additions, and (ii) "Tax Return" shall mean
all returns and reports (including elections, declarations, disclosures,

Proxy Statement is filed, or at any time it is supplemented or amended, or at
the time it is cleared by the SEC or sent to the stockholders of the Company,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Proxy Statement to be sent to the stockholders of the
Company in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting will, at the time
of the Company Stockholders Meeting, comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company makes no representations or warranties with respect to
information that has been or will be supplied by the Acquiror or Merger Sub,
or any of their respective representatives, specifically for use in the Proxy
Statement.

SECTION 3.12 _Fairness Opinion_. Wachovia Securities and Cohen and Steers have
each delivered to the Company Board their opinions dated as of the date of
this Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration
is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the Sizeler Common
Stock at the time of the execution of this Agreement.

SECTION 3.13 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker (other than
Wachovia Securities and Cohen and Steers) is entitled to any brokerage,
finders or other fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by and on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 3.14 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company has taken all necessary
corporate action so that no "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or
regulation enacted under the MGCL or the federal laws in the United States
applicable to the Company is applicable to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including any takeover or ownership
restriction provision in the Companys organizational documents.

from the shares of Sizeler Common Stock to which they are attached or to
become distributable, unredeemable or exercisable. 

SECTION 3.16 _Intellectual Property_. Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect: (a) the Company and
its Subsidiaries own or have the rights to use all patents, inventions,
copyrights, software, trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade dress,
trade secrets and all other intellectual property rights of any kind or
nature ("Intellectual Property") used in their business as currently
conducted, all of which shall survive the execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby;
and (b)(i) to the knowledge of the Company, nothing used in the Companys
business as currently conducted infringes the Intellectual Property of any
third party and no Intellectual Property of the Company is being infringed by
any third party; and (ii) there is no action pending and no claim has been
asserted or threatened alleging the same.

under any applicable Environmental Law; (iv) neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written notification alleging any violation

respective businesses only in the ordinary course consistent with past

transactions contemplated hereby (an "Acquiror Material Adverse Effect"). The
Acquiror and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
business, and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of
its properties owned, leased or operated by it or the management of

action and no other proceedings on the part of the Acquiror, Merger Sub or
Parent are necessary pursuant to their respective organizational documents,
the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Acquiror was formed, and the MGCL to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Acquiror and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each such entity enforceable against such entity in accordance

conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally, and general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The board of

Acquiror or Merger Sub, (ii) result in any breach or violation of or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) or result in the loss of a material benefit under, or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, material amendment or
material acceleration of, any Contract to which the Acquiror or Merger Sub is
a party or by which the Acquiror or Merger Sub or any of their respective
properties are bound, except, in the case of clause (ii) of this

takeover and "blue sky" laws, (ii) applicable requirements of Canadian
provincial securities laws and the rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange, (iii)
any approvals or authorizations required by Section 6.8(b) or (c), and (iv)

Acquisition Proposal in clause (B) of Section 8.2(b)(ii) and (iii) and the
definition of Company Superior Proposal, the percentage 50% shall be
substituted for the percentage 10%, (B) approve, agree to or recommend any
Company Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement with respect to a
Company Acquisition Proposal, (C) directly or indirectly, engage in any
negotiations or discussions concerning, or provide access to its properties,
books and records or any confidential information or data to any person
relating to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, or (D) otherwise knowingly
encourage or facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement a Company
Acquisition Proposal.

Subject to the rights of the Acquiror under Section 8.1(d)(ii), nothing
contained in this Agreement (including the preceding paragraph) shall prevent
the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any legally required disclosure
to stockholders with regard to a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) prior to
the approval of the Merger by the Companys stockholders in accordance with
this Agreement, providing access to its



 

31 properties, books and records and providing information or data in response to
a request therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Company Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board receives from the person so
requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement containing
confidentiality and other restrictions on terms at least as favorable to the
Company as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, (iii) prior to
the approval of the Merger by the Companys stockholders in accordance with
this Agreement, engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any person
who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal, or
(iv) prior to the approval of the Merger by the Companys stockholders in
accordance with this Agreement and following the receipt of a bona fide
written Company Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
Section 6.4(a), (A) withdrawing, modifying or changing in any adverse manner
the Company Recommendation or (B) recommending an unsolicited bona fide
written Company Acquisition Proposal; if and only to the extent that in
connection with the foregoing clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that, (1) in the case of clause
(iv) above only, such Company Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably
likely to be consummated, taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory, timing and similar aspects of the proposal and the person making
the proposal and would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable
to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger
(any such more favorable Company Acquisition Proposal being referred to in
this Agreement as a "Company Superior Proposal") and (2) in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii) above only, there is a reasonable likelihood that such
actions could lead to a Company Superior Proposal.

The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any persons
conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal (but the foregoing will not prevent further interaction
with any such persons to the extent permitted by the preceding paragraph).

After the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly notify the
Acquiror of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-
public information or inquiry that it reasonably believes will lead to a
Company Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.4 to the contrary, if, at any
time prior to the approval of the Merger by the Companys stockholders in
accordance with this Agreement, the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, in
response to a Company Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited, that such
proposal is a Company Superior Proposal, the Company or the Company Board may
terminate this Agreement; if (i) the Company Requisite Vote has not yet been
received, and (ii) the Company has first given the Acquiror at least five (5)
business days to respond to such Company Acquisition Proposal after the
Company has notified the Acquiror that, in the absence of any further action
by the Acquiror, the Company would consider such Company



 

32 Acquisition Proposal to be a Company Superior Proposal and would terminate
this Agreement, and given due consideration to any amendments or
modifications to this Agreement proposed by the Acquiror during such period;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this sentence, and any purported termination pursuant to this
sentence shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company prior to
or concurrently with such termination pursuant to this Section 6.4(b) pays to
the Acquiror the fee payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b).

SECTION 6.5 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall assume and honor, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and honor, the obligations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries under all existing Company Plans and the
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall perform the
obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under such Company Plans in
the same manner and to the same extent that the Company and its Subsidiaries
would have been required to perform hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
except as otherwise explicitly provided herein, nothing herein shall be
construed to prevent, on or following the Effective Time, (i) the termination
of employment of any individual who immediately prior to the Effective Time
was an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (such employees, the
"Company Employees") or (ii) the amendment or termination of any Company Plan
to the extent permitted by the terms thereof and applicable law.

(b) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Acquiror
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to arrange for each Company
Employee that was participating in any of the Plans of the Company immediately
before the Effective Time to receive employee benefits and compensation which
shall be no less favorable, in the aggregate, to the benefits that were
provided to the Company Employees prior to the Effective Time either by: (i)
continuing the compensation and employee benefit plans provided to the Company
Employees by the Company prior to the Effective Time (the "Existing Plans")
or (ii) enrolling the Company Employee in the Acquirors compensation and
benefit plans as provided for in this Section 6.5 (the "Counterpart Plans").
Such participants shall receive full credit for years of service with the
Company or any Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time for all purposes for
which such service was recognized under the Plans. If Company Employees
participate in Counterpart Plans for purposes of satisfying the obligations
under this Section 6.5, Acquiror shall, or shall cause one of its subsidiaries
to, waive all pre-existing conditions (to the extent waived under the
applicable employee welfare benefit plans of the Company) otherwise
applicable to employees of the Company under the Counterpart Plans. Acquiror
shall give credit under those of its Counterpart Plans that are welfare
benefit plans for all co-payments, waiting periods, deductibles and out-of-
pocket maximums satisfied by employees (and their eligible dependents) of the
Company and the Subsidiaries, in respect of the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs. Notwithstanding the forgoing, Acquiror may continue one
or more of the Plans, in which case Acquiror shall have satisfied its
obligations hereunder with respect to the benefits so provided if the terms of
the Plans which are continued are no less favorable, as a whole, than the
terms of the Counterpart Plans (as applicable). 



 

33 (c) The Acquiror acknowledges that a "change of control" or a "change in
control," as that term is used in any Company Plan that contains such term,
shall occur at the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Acquiror agrees that, under the agreements with the individuals
listed in Section 6.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Merger will
constitute a "change in control" (as such term is defined under such
agreements).

(d) For the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the Plan
Conversion Date (as hereinafter defined), the Acquiror shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain those Company Plans that provide medical,
prescription drug, dental, vision and disability benefits for active Company
Employees. For purposes of this Section 6.6(d), "Plan Conversion Date" shall
mean the first day of the first plan year following the Effective Time of the
health plans for the Acquirors similarly situated employees.

SECTION 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer or
employee may have under any Employment Agreement, indemnification agreement,
Company Plan or otherwise, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each individual who was (as of
the Effective Time) a present or former officer or director of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys fees and
disbursements (collectively, "Costs"), incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including, without limitation, arising out of or
pertaining to this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated
hereby). Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of reasonable
expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation from Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation within ten business
days of receipt by Acquiror from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor,
subject only to the provisions of undertakings required for such advancement
by the MGCL.

(b) The charter and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified Parties than are set forth in the
Charter and the Bylaws in effect immediately prior to the execution of this
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period ending on



 

34 the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time in any manner that would
materially adversely affect the rights hereunder as of the Effective Time of
any of the Indemnified Parties. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
have the option to obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a
claims period of up to six years from and after the Effective Time from its
current insurance carriers or one or more insurance carriers with the same or
better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carriers with respect
to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Company expend for such policies an aggregate
amount in excess of $750,000 (and to the extent the aggregate amount
thereof would be in excess of $750,000, the Company may acquire such amount
of insurance as may be obtained by such maximum amount or may acquire tail
insurance corresponding to a lesser number of years up to such maximum
amount). If the Company does not obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of
the Effective Time, then Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect until
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time the current policies of the
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(provided, that the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions which are not materially less advantageous to any beneficiary
thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Acquiror or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an aggregate
amount in excess of $750,000 (and to the extent the annual premium is in
excess thereof, Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation will acquire such amount
of insurance as may be obtained by such maximum premium amount). The Acquiror
agrees to honor and perform under, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to
honor and perform under, all indemnification agreements with the Indemnified
Parties entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
date of this Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against or involves any Indemnified Party, on or prior
to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section
6.6 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.



 

35 SECTION 6.7 _Tax Matters._

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries will duly and timely file all Tax Returns and
other documents required by it to be filed with federal, state and local Tax
authorities the failure to file of which could have a material negative
impact, financial or otherwise, subject to extensions permitted by law and
properly granted by the appropriate authority, _provided_ that the Company
notifies the Acquiror that it or any of its subsidiaries is availing itself of
such extensions, and _provided_ , _further_ , that such extensions do not
adversely affect the Companys status as a REIT under the Code. Any Tax
Return filed pursuant to this Section 6.7(a) shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall make or change any material Tax election, change any annual tax
accounting period, adopt or change any method of Tax accounting, file any
material amended Tax Returns or claims for material Tax refunds, enter into
any material closing agreement, surrender any material Tax claim, audit or
assessment, surrender any right to claim a material Tax refund, offset or
other reduction in Tax liability surrendered, consent to any extension or
waiver of the limitations period applicable to any material Tax claim or
material assessment of Tax or omit to take any other action, if any such
action or omission would have the effect of materially increasing the Tax
liability or materially reducing any Tax asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(b) Each party shall cooperate in the preparation, execution, and filing of
all returns, questionnaires, applications, or other documents regarding
any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock
transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees
and any similar taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.8 _Further Action and Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party shall
cooperate with the other and use its reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations to
satisfy the conditions to Closing set forth herein and to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the financing for the Merger. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each party hereto agrees, to the extent necessary, to make an
appropriate filing pursuant to any Antitrust Law (as defined below) with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to any Antitrust Law and to take all other actions necessary, proper or
advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under any Antitrust Law as soon as practicable.

(b) Each of Acquiror and Merger Sub on the one hand, and the Company on the
other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section
6.8(a) to obtain any requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law, use its
reasonable efforts to



 

36 (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any required
filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or other
inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the
other party informed of any communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or any other
United States or foreign governmental authority and of any communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in
each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii)
permit the other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult
with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the
DOJ or any such other governmental authority or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent
permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable governmental authority
or other person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and conferences. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Antitrust Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other federal,
state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in Sections 6.8(a) and 6.8(b), if any objections are asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law
or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the
DOJ or any other applicable governmental authority or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any
Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
each of the Acquiror, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable
efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 6.8 shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) so long as such party has up to then
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.8.

SECTION 6.9 _Public Announcements_. Schedule 6.9 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth the form of the initial public release concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby which shall be jointly issued by the parties
and thereafter each party shall use its reasonable efforts to allow each
other party reasonable time to comment on press releases or announcements
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in advance of
their issuance, it being understood that the final form and content of any
such release or announcement shall be at the final discretion of the
disclosing party.



 

37 SECTION 6.10 _Dividends_.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not declare
or pay any dividend or distribution to its stockholders except for (i)
distributions required by the Code for the Company to maintain its REIT status
or necessary to eliminate any federal Tax liability, (ii) quarterly
distributions at a rate not in excess of $0.10 per share (the
"Quarterly Rate") of Sizeler Common Stock to the holders thereof prior to the
Effective Time with record and payment dates in accordance with past practice
and (iii) quarterly distributions to the holders of the Sizeler Series B
Preferred Stock in accordance with and as required by the terms of such
security. In the event that a distribution with respect to the Sizeler Common
Stock permitted by this Section 6.10 (including pursuant to Section 6.10(b)
below) has (1) a record date prior to the Effective Time and (2) has not been
paid as of the Effective Time, the holders of Sizeler Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive such distribution from the Company at the time such shares
are exchanged pursuant to Article II of this Agreement.

(b) The Company shall declare a dividend (the "Closing Dividend") on the
outstanding Sizeler Common Stock, the record date for which shall be the
close of business on the last business day prior to the Effective Time. The
Closing Dividend shall be an amount equal to the last quarterly dividend
declared by the Company on a share of Sizeler Common Stock, multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed in the calendar
quarter in which the Effective Time occurs and the denominator of which is the
total number of days in the calendar quarter in which the Effective Time
occurs.

Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement

reason of this Agreement, other than with respect to the provisions of Section
6.5 and 6.6 which shall inure to the benefit of the persons or entities
benefiting therefrom, who are intended to be third-party beneficiaries
thereof.

SECTION 9.7 _Governing Law_. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND WITHOUT REGARD
TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PROVISIONS THEREOF. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT

CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND HEREBY WAIVE, AND AGREE NOT TO ASSERT, AS A DEFENSE
IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING FOR THE INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF OR OF ANY SUCH DOCUMENT, THAT IT IS NOT SUBJECT THERETO OR THAT SUCH
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING MAY NOT BE BROUGHT OR IS NOT MAINTAINABLE IN SAID
COURTS OR THAT THE VENUE THEREOF MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE OR THAT THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY SUCH DOCUMENT MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN OR BY SUCH COURTS, AND THE

TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND

48 SECTION 9.9 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.10  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

SECTION 9.11 _Acquiror Guarantee_. Acquiror agrees to take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to
perform all of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this
Agreement. Acquiror unconditionally guarantees to the Company the full and
complete performance by Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, of its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall be
liable for any breach of any covenant or obligation of Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this Agreement. Merger Sub shall
at all times be a direct or indirect Subsidiary of Acquiror. This is a
guarantee of payment and performance and not collectibility. Acquiror hereby
waives diligence, presentment, demand of performance, filing of any claim, any
right to require any proceeding first against Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in
connection with the performance of its obligations set forth in this Section
9.11. Acquiror further waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by law which limit
the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, except to the extent
that any such defense is available to Merger Sub, in connection with such
performance.

SECTION 9.12 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to
a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference purposes only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the
words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Whenever the
words "herein," "hereof," "hereto," or "hereunder" are used in this
Agreement, they will be deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any specific Section of this Agreement. Whenever used in this Agreement,
except as otherwise expressly provided or unless the context otherwise
requires, any noun or pronoun shall be deemed to include the plural as well as
the singular. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in the
Acquiror Disclosure Schedule or the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be
construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement. Such information shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the
term "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement. The
parties to this Agreement have participated jointly in the negotiating and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any provision of this Agreement.



 

49 SECTION 9.13 _Obligations of Acquiror and Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a subsidiary of Acquiror to take any action, such requirements shall
be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Acquiror to cause such
subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirements shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such subsidiary to
take such action.

SECTION 9.14 _Survival; No Amendment_. In the event that the Surviving
Corporation or Acquiror or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or the
Acquiror, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation or the Acquiror, as the case may be, under this
Agreement that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in
part after the Effective Time, including without limitation the applicable
provisions of Article II, VI, VIII and IX. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, from and after the Effective Time, this Agreement
shall not be amended, modified or terminated in any manner that adversely
affects the rights of any person (whether or not a party hereto) other than
the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation contained in the applicable
provisions of Articles II, VI, VIII and IX.
