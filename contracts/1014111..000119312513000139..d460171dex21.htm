(f) Buyer, the Company, and the Surviving Corporation may withhold from the
cash sum payable to any Selling Party who is an employee or former employee
of the Company, and pay to the appropriate taxing authorities, any amounts
which Buyer, the Company, or the Surviving Corporation may be required to
withhold from such Persons under the Code, or any provision of state, local
or foreign Law relating to Tax on income. Any sum which is withheld and paid
to a taxing authority as permitted by this Section will be deemed for purposes
of this Article 1 to have been paid to the Person with regard to whom it is
withheld.

(g) Any time a Non-Accredited Selling Party is entitled to a cash payment
pursuant to  _Section 1.5(e)(2)(ii)_, then, with respect to all such Non-
Accredited Selling Parties, Buyer and the Selling Parties Representative will
issue a joint written direction to the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, authorizing the Escrow Agent to release to Buyer that number of
shares of Buyer Stock which the applicable Non-Accredited Selling Parties
would have been entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 1.5(e)(3)(A)_ if
such Non-Accredited Selling Parties were Accredited Selling Parties, plus an
amount in cash equal to any Fractional Share Amount. No later than two
Business Days following such release of shares, Buyer will deposit into the
Escrow Account an amount of cash equal to that number of shares received from
the

 



5  Escrow Agent __multiplied by__ the average closing sale price per share of
Buyer Stock that is publically traded on the New York Stock Exchange for the
five (5) consecutive trading days ending with the trading day two days
preceding the date of such release of shares.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 1, (i) until the
release of the Buyer Stock to the Selling Parties on or about the date that is
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, the books and records of the
Selling Parties Representative will include (and the Selling Parties
Representative shall have the right to cause the Escrow Agents books and
records to include) each Selling Parties Pro-Rata Percentage of the Buyer
Stock in the Escrow Account, including fractional shares, and each Selling
Party shall have the right to all dividends or other distributions of Buyer
relating to whole shares and fractional shares of Buyer Stock allocated to
such party, and to vote and exercise all rights of a stockholder of Buyer
with respect to such whole shares and fractional shares of Buyer Stock
allocated to such party and (ii) upon the release of the Buyer Stock to the
Selling Parties on or about the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date and thereafter (if any shares of Buyer Stock remain after such
date), no certificates or scrips representing fractional shares of Buyer Stock
shall be issued, and in lieu of such fractional shares, Buyer shall pay an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
fractional share to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by (B) the
Buyer Stock Reference Price (or, in the case of _Section 1.5(e)(2)_ and 
_Section 1.5(g)_, the average closing sale price per share of Buyer Stock
determined pursuant to such Sections, such product being the " _Fractional
Share Amount_ ").

 

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 1, prior to the
release of any of the cash amounts allocable to the Initial Indemnification
Escrow Amount to the Selling Parties as provided above, any expenses of the
Selling Parties Representative that are, together with all other Selling
Parties Representative expenses, in excess of the Selling
Parties Representative Escrow Amount, and that have been approved in
accordance with the letter agreement among the Selling Parties Representative
and certain of the Selling Parties, shall be deducted from the remaining
Initial Indemnification Escrow Amount to be so released, and instead added to
the Selling Parties Representative Escrow Amount, and the remaining Initial
Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be paid to the Selling Parties as provided
above.

 

1.6 _Closing Escrow Payments_. At the Closing:

(a) Buyer will deposit into the Escrow Account established pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement contemplated by _Section 8.10_ the following
(the aggregate value of which is the " _Initial Indemnification Escrow
Amount_ "):

(1) Buyer will deposit into the Escrow Account $5,975,000 in cash (plus the
value of any Fractional Share Amount, determined pursuant to _Section
1.6(a)(2)_); and

(2) Buyer will deposit into the Escrow Account and register in the name of the
Escrow Agent 1,327,777 shares of Buyer Stock representing a value, as measured
at the Buyer Stock Reference Price of $5,975,000 (less the value of any
Fractional Share Amount, which Fractional Share Amount shall be deposited in
cash into the Escrow Account).

 



6 (b) Buyer will deposit into an escrow account established pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement contemplated by _Section 8.10_, the cash
amount of $200,000 (the " _Selling Parties  Representative Escrow Amount_").
The Selling Parties Representative Escrow Amount would otherwise be
distributed to the Escrow Recipients in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 1.5(e)_ ( _i.e.,_ allocated among the Escrow Recipients based on
their respective Pro Rata Percentage), however, the Selling Parties
Representative Escrow Amount __will not__ be distributed or made available to
the Escrow Recipients in accordance with the provisions of _Section 1.5(e)_
and the provisions of this _Section 1.6(b)_ and the Escrow Agreement will
control the release of the Selling Parties Representative Escrow Amount. The
Selling Parties Representative Escrow Amount will be deposited by Buyer with
the Escrow Agent in a sub-account segregated from the Escrow Account and under
the control of the Selling Parties Representative (the " _Selling Parties 
Representative Escrow Account_"). The Selling Parties Representative Escrow
Account will be used, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement, to fund the activities of the Selling Parties
Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The release of
the amounts in the Selling Parties Representative Escrow Account will occur
within ten Business Days of the last release by the Escrow Agent to the
Disbursing Agent of the balance of the Initial Indemnification Escrow Amount
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and of the Escrow Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Selling Parties Representative Escrow Amount will be
in addition to the amount deposited into escrow pursuant to _Sections
1.6(a)_, _(c)_ , and _(d)_ and will not be the property of Buyer.

 

(c) [**]

certifying that the amounts contained in the letters are true, accurate and
complete as of the Closing Date. The sum of the Indebtedness amounts listed
for the Closing Date as certified by the Companys Chief Financial Officer
will be the " _Closing Borrowed Money Debt Amount_." On the Closing Date,
Buyer will pay in cash to each counterparty to a Payoff Letter the amount of
Indebtedness indicated in such Payoff Letter in accordance with all of the
terms and conditions stated in the applicable Payoff Letter.

extent not already fully vested, shall vest in full, shall no longer be

_Vested RSU_ ") and shall be entitled to receive its allocable payment for
Common Share Equivalents as set forth in _Section 1.11(g)_. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay such amount to holders of Vested RSUs, after deduction
of applicable withholding taxes, on the Closing Date,

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Cancelled Option RSU then

9 (b) For each Company Warrant which is not exercised prior to the Effective
Time, the Company will obtain prior to the Effective Time, from each holder

of any redeemed shares of Exchangeable Stock or Vested RSU, evidence
reasonably satisfactory that all shares of Exchangeable Stock or each Vested
RSU have been converted into the right to receive shares of Common Stock on a

(a) The " _Net Book Value Deviation_ " is equal to the dollar amount
represented by the following: [**]

 

(b) Attached hereto as _Exhibit 1.13(b)_ is the Companys good faith estimate
of the balance sheet of the Company as at December 31, 2012 the (" _Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet_ "). The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Balance Sheet will reflect the adjustments described and defined in _Exhibit
1.13(b)_. [**]

 

(c) The " _Cash Deficiency_ " is equal to the excess, if any, of the Estimated
Excess Cash Amount over the Excess Cash Amount. If the arithmetic result of
the calculation described in the preceding sentence results in a negative
number, then the Cash Deficiency is equal to zero. The " _Cash Payment_ " is
equal to the excess, if any, of the Excess Cash Amount over the Estimated
Excess Cash Amount. If the arithmetic result of the calculation described in
the preceding sentence results in a negative number, then the Cash Payment is
equal to zero. The amount by which the cash amount as shown on the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet exceeds the Minimum Closing Cash Amount calculated based
on the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet is the " _Estimated Excess Cash
Amount_." The amount by which (a) the cash amount as shown on the Closing
Balance Sheet as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 1.13_ exceeds
(b) the Minimum Closing Cash Amount calculated based on the Closing Balance
Sheet as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 1.13_  _ _minus__ any
accrued but unpaid amounts funded to the Company under _Section 1.10_ with
respect to the amounts referenced in Sections 1.5(b)(5), 1.5(b)(7), 1.5(b)(8),
and 1.5(b)(9) is the " _Excess Cash Amount_." For the avoidance of doubt, any
calculations under this _Section 1.13(c)_ and any calculation of the Final
Net Book Value Amount shall result in a number that would have resulted if (i)
all deductions from the Aggregate Preliminary Cash Consideration Amount in
_Section 1.5(b)_ were paid to the designated payee of such amounts, any (ii)
and related reserves, cash or other entries in the Companys financial
statements were removed. 

(d) On or before the 60th day after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare, at
Buyers expense, a balance sheet of the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") without giving effect to any
of the Transactions; provided, however, that if the Effective Time shall occur
during the month of January, 2013, then such Closing Balance Sheet shall be
prepared as of December 31, 2012. The Closing Balance Sheet will set forth a
calculation of the Net Book Value Deviation and the Cash Deficiency or Cash
Payment, as applicable. Buyer will promptly deliver a copy of the Closing
Balance Sheet to the Selling Parties Representative. The Closing Balance
Sheet will (i) be prepared in accordance with GAAP as consistently applied in
the preparation of the Company Financial Statements as modified
as contemplated in _Section 1.13(b)_, and (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the financial position of the Company as of the Effective
Time (and without giving effect to any developments, events, actions or
omissions occurring after the Effective Time); provided, however, that the
Closing Balance Sheet will not reflect any adjustment due to the fact that any

customer of any Acquired Company. During the 30-day period immediately
following Buyers delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer will use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Selling Parties Representative
and the Selling Parties accountants who are acceptable to Buyer acting
reasonably (the " _Sellers  Accountant_") reasonable access to the Companys
financial books and records as the Selling Parties Representative or the
Sellers Accountant may reasonably request to enable them to review the
Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Net Book Value Deviation and
Cash Deficiency or Cash Payment, as applicable. To the extent not previously
paid at Closing as a Company Transaction Expense, all fees and expenses in
connection with the review of the Closing Balance Sheet, including the fees
of the Sellers Accountant, will be for the Selling Parties account. On or
prior to the 30th day following delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet by
Buyer, the Selling Parties Representative may give Buyer a written notice
stating either (i) that it accepts the Closing Balance Sheet (an " _Acceptance
Notice_ ") or (ii) the Selling Parties Representatives objections (an "
_Objection Notice_ ") to the Closing Balance Sheet. Any Objection Notice will
specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount of any objection and the basis
therefor. Any determination expressly set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet
which is not specifically objected to in an Objection Notice will be deemed
final and binding upon the parties upon delivery of the Objection Notice. If
the Selling Parties Representative does not give Buyer an Acceptance Notice
or an Objection Notice within such 30-day period, then the Closing Balance
Sheet will be conclusive and binding upon the parties and the Net Book Value
Deviation and Cash Deficiency or Cash Payment, as applicable, set forth in the
Closing Balance Sheet will constitute the final Net Book Value Deviation
and Cash Deficiency or Cash Payment, as applicable, for purposes of this
_Section 1.13_.

(e) If the Selling Parties Representative gives a timely Objection Notice as
described in _Section 1.13(d)_ above, then Buyer and the Selling Parties
Representative will negotiate in good faith to resolve their disputes
regarding the Closing Balance Sheet.

(f) If Buyer and the Selling Parties Representative are unable to resolve all
disputes regarding the Net Book Value Deviation and Cash Deficiency or Cash
Payment, as applicable, on or prior to the 45th day after the Objection Notice
is given or the expiration of the period for providing an Acceptance Notice or
Objection Notice, then Buyer and the Selling Parties Representative will
retain a firm of certified public accountants chosen randomly by lot from
among the "final four" accounting firms other than Sellers Accountant and
Buyers Accountant (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") to determine the
Net Book Value Deviation and Cash Deficiency or Cash Payment, as applicable,
as soon as practicable. The Independent Accounting Firm will only decide the
specific items under dispute and will be instructed to determine the Net Book
Value Deviation and Cash Deficiency or Cash Payment, as applicable, in
accordance with the principles set forth in this Agreement. The Net Book Value
Deviation and Cash Deficiency or Cash Payment, as applicable, determined by
the Independent Accounting Firm will be conclusive and binding upon the
parties and will constitute the Net Book Value Deviation and Cash Deficiency
or Cash Payment, as applicable, for purposes of this  _Section 1.13_. The
fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm in connection with its
determination of the Net Book Value Deviation and Cash Deficiency or Cash
Payment, as applicable, will be paid by Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Selling Parties, on the other hand, in equal proportion; provided that the
Selling Parties portion will be paid from and limited to the interest earned
by Buyer on the Escrow Funds, as provided in the Escrow Agreement, to the
maximum extent possible.

 



17 (g) The final determination date of Net Book Value Deviation and Cash
Deficiency or Cash Payment, as applicable, as described in this _Section
1.13_ will be the " _Determination Date_."

(h) If the Net Book Value Deviation is zero and there is a Cash Deficiency or
Cash Payment, as finally determined based on the Closing Balance Sheet, then
an adjustment will be made and the Aggregate Final Cash Consideration will be
equal to the Aggregate Preliminary Cash Consideration Amount plus the Cash
Payment or minus the Cash Deficiency, as applicable. In the event there is a
Cash Payment, Buyer will pay to the Disbursing Agent for further distribution
to the Selling Parties in full and in cash the Cash Payment amount, and the
Selling Parties Representative and Buyer will issue a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to the Disbursing Agent in full and
in cash for further distribution to the Escrow Recipients, the Initial
Reconciliation Escrow Amount __plus__ all accumulated interest in the Escrow
Account attributable thereto. In the event there is a Cash Deficiency, the
Selling Parties Representative and Buyer will issue a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to deduct from the Escrow Account the amount
of such Cash Deficiency and release to the Disbursing Agent in full and in
cash for further distribution to the Escrow Recipients, any remaining
Initial Reconciliation Escrow Amount __plus__ all accumulated interest in the
Escrow Account attributable thereto.

(i) If the Net Book Value Deviation is a positive number, then the following
will occur:

(1) Buyer will pay to the Selling Parties in full and in cash the Net Book
Value Deviation __minus__ the Cash Deficiency (if any) __plus__ the Cash
Payment (if any) and __plus__ interest on that resulting amount from the
Closing Date to the day preceding the date of payment at the prime rate as
published in the "Wall Street Journal" Midwest Edition as of the Determination
Date; and

(2) Selling Parties Representative and Buyer will issue a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to the Disbursing Agent in full and
in cash for further distribution to the Escrow Recipients, the Initial
Reconciliation Escrow Amount __plus__ all accumulated interest in the Escrow
Account attributable thereto.

(j) If the Net Book Value Deviation is a negative number, then the following
will occur:

(1) the Selling Parties Representative and Buyer will issue a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to pay to the Surviving Corporation out of the
Escrow Account in cash the Net Book Value Deviation amount __plus__ the Cash
Deficiency (if any) __minus__ the Cash Payment (if any) and __plus__ interest
on that resulting amount from the Closing Date to the day preceding the date
of payment at the prime rate as published in the "Wall Street Journal"
Midwest Edition as of the Determination Date, in full by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Surviving Corporation within ten days of the Determination Date; and

 



18 (2) the Selling Parties Representative and Buyer will issue a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent to release to the Disbursing Agent in full and
in cash for further distribution to the Escrow Recipients, any remaining
amount in the Initial Reconciliation Escrow Amount after the operation of
clause (1) immediately above __plus__ all accumulated interest in the Escrow
Account attributable thereto.

(k) The exclusive remedy and sole source of funds for any payment due
pursuant to _Section 1.13(j)_ shall be the Escrow Account and no Stockholder,
Selling Party or Escrow Recipient shall have any liability therefor beyond the
amounts then contained in the Escrow Account.

(l) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 1.13_ will be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law.

1.14  _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, each share (if any) of Company Stock issued and outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time for which the holder has the right to
demand, and has made a demand for, appraisal of such share under Section 262
of the DGCL (each a " _Dissenting Share_ ") will not be converted into the
right to receive its portion of the Total Final Merger Consideration as
provided by this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, and the Company or
the Surviving Corporation will therefore have no obligation to pay the portion
of the Total Merger Consideration in respect of any such Dissenting Share,
unless and until the holder of such shares withdraws his or her demand for
dissenters rights or becomes ineligible for dissenters rights. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect (or otherwise loses) any such
right to appraisal, then each such share of such holder will be treated as a
share that had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive its portion of the Total Final Merger Consideration as provided by
this Agreement, without interest. The Company will give prompt notice to
Buyer of each demand received by the Company for appraisal of Company Stock,
and Buyer will have the right to participate in negotiations and proceedings
regarding each such demand. The Company will not, except with the
prior written consent of Buyer (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or make, or offer to settle or make,
any payment regarding any such demand. Each Person holding of record or
beneficially owning Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled under Section 262
of the DGCL and this _Section 1.14_ to payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares (and any other payments required by Section 262 of the DGCL)
will receive payment therefor from the Disbursing Agent as provided in
_Section 1.11(f)_ and shall contribute to the Escrow Account as provided
herein.

1.15 _Miscellaneous Consideration Terms_.

(a) No later than 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date, Buyer will
deposit with U.S. Bank National Association or such other bank or trust
company engaged by the Company and acceptable to Buyer acting reasonably (the
" _Disbursing Agent_ ") an amount of cash sufficient to pay the sum of the
Aggregate Preliminary Cash Consideration Amount __plus__ the

 



19  Aggregate Total Stock Consideration Amount (other than the payments made for
Vested Company Stock Options and Cancelled Option RSUs pursuant to _Section
1.8_) __less__ the Initial Escrow Amount, __less__ the Initial Reconciliation
Escrow Amount, __less__ the Selling Parties Representative Escrow Amount and
__less__ the Employee Closing Consideration Amount (such sum, the "
_Conversion Payment_ "). All fees and expenses associated with the engagement
and services provided by the Disbursing Agent shall be shared equally between
the Company and Buyer.

 

(b) The Disbursing Agent will invest the deposited sum in its discretion
(provided that Buyer will be responsible for replacing any losses of
principal resulting from such investments) and all interest thereon will be
paid to Buyer for its sole benefit and reported for Tax purposes as earned by
Buyer. No interest will accrue or be payable with respect to any amounts which
a holder of shares of Company Stock will be entitled to receive.

(c) At the Effective Time, Buyer will instruct the Disbursing Agent to pay by
check or wire transfer, as instructed by the Company, the applicable portion
of the Conversion Payment to each record holder of Company Stock existing
immediately before the Effective Time (other than to those holders of
Dissenting Shares not entitled to payment or to those holders entitled to
receive a payment from the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 1.8), as
promptly as practicable following the record holders taking of both the
following actions: 

(1) the submission to the Disbursing Agent of a duly executed letter of
transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 1.15_ (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), which will specify that risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass only upon proper delivery of such documents to the
Disbursing Agent, and which will be in the form and have such provisions as
Buyer and Company may reasonably specify (such provisions to include a waiver
of any appraisal or similar dissenters rights), and

 

(2) the surrender of the certificates that represented shares of Company Stock
(or in the case of any redeemed shares of Exchangeable Stock or shares of
Common Stock formerly represented by a Vested RSU, evidence reasonably
satisfactory that all shares of Exchangeable Stock or shares of Common Stock
formerly represented by a Vested RSU have been converted into the right to
receive shares of Common Stock on a one for one basis) (collectively, the "
_Certificates_ ") to the Disbursing Agent in exchange for the applicable
payment of its respective portion of the Conversion Payment by such holder
of record (which Certificates will then be cancelled). If any Certificate has
been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such document to be lost, stolen, or destroyed and, if
required by Buyer or the Disbursing Agent, the payment of any reasonable
fees, and the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Buyer or the Disbursing Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such document, the Disbursing Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed document, the
applicable payment of its respective portion of the sum of the Conversion
Payment to which the holder is entitled under this  _Article 1_.

(d) The applicable portion of the Conversion Payment delivered upon surrender
in exchange for shares of Company Stock in accordance with the terms hereof
will be

 



20  deemed to have been delivered in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to such shares of Company Stock. After the Effective Time, no further
transfers will be made on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares
of Company Stock. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock will
cease to exist, and each Certificate previously representing any such shares
will represent only the right to receive the applicable portion of the
Conversion Payment (provided, however, that, Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares will entitle the holder thereof only the right to receive
fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL) as
described in  _Section 1.11_ and _Section 1.14_ subject to the terms of
this Agreement. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent for transfer, they will be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 1_, except as otherwise
provided by Applicable Law.

(e) Upon Buyers written request, the Disbursing Agent will redeliver or
repay to Buyer any cash made available to the Disbursing Agent and not
exchanged for Certificates within 18 months after the Effective Time. After
such time any holder of Certificates who has not yet delivered or surrendered
such Certificates to the Disbursing Agent, subject to Applicable Law, will
look as a general creditor only to Buyer for payment of the applicable portion
of the Conversion Payment. Despite any provision of this Agreement, to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, none of Buyer, the Disbursing
Agent, the Surviving Corporation, the Selling Parties Representative, or any
other Person will be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any
cash delivered to a public official according to applicable abandoned
property, escheat, or similar law.

(f) Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing Agent will be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment to be made under this
Agreement all Taxes that Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing
Agent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
such payment under the Code (or any provision of other Applicable Law). Taxes
withheld pursuant to this _Section 1.15_ by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation,
or the Disbursing Agent, as the case may be, will be (1) timely remitted by
the withholding Person to the appropriate Governmental Authority and (2)
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

ARTICLE 2 __

_CLOSING_

2.1 _Generally_. Subject to the continued fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions precedent set forth in Article 7 and the termination provisions set
forth in Article 6, the closing of the Transactions (the " _Closing_ ") will
occur at Noon, Central Time on December 31, 2012 or (b) at such other time as
Buyer and the Company may mutually agree (with the actual date of such closing
being the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing will be held at the offices of
Faegre Baker Daniels LLP in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the address appearing
in the notice provisions in _Section 9.1_ or at such other place to be

documents to be executed or delivered at Closing will be deemed to have been
taken, executed and delivered simultaneously, and no action will be deemed

taken, delivered and executed, except in each case to the extent otherwise
stated in this Agreement or any such other document.

 



21 2.2 _Closing Deliveries_. At the Closing, the Company and the Selling
Parties will have delivered to Buyer, and Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary will

2.3 _Filing of the Certificate of Merger_. Subject to the other provisions of
this Agreement, at the Closing the Company and Buyer Subsidiary will cause
the Certificate of Merger to be filed as provided in _Section 1.2_ and will
take any and all other lawful actions and do any and all other lawful things
necessary to cause the Merger to become effective. 

ARTICLE 3 __

business. Each Acquired Company is duly qualified and in good standing to do
business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the ownership
or leasing of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business

would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

 

3.2 _Capitalization_. _Exhibit A_ lists all Stockholders of the Company and
all shares of capital stock and other equity interests of the Company held by
each of them. _Schedule 3.2_ lists the equity interests held by any Acquired
Company, directly or indirectly, in any other Person, if any, which is not an
Acquired Company and (c) each Company Subsidiary. The equity interests held
by the Company of each Acquired Company constitute all of the outstanding
equity interests of each Acquired Company. The Company or another Acquired
Company has good and valid title to all equity interests of each Acquired
Company other than the Company, free and clear of any Encumbrance (other than
restrictions imposed by securities laws applicable to securities generally).
Other than rights of Buyer created hereunder and any other rights that may
be disclosed on _Schedule 3.2_ , there is no: (1) pre-emptive right, option,
warrant, put, call, purchase right, subscription right, conversion right,
convertible instrument, exchange right or other security, Contract or
commitment of any nature whereby any Person has, or has a right to receive,
any equity interest of, or right or obligation to acquire any equity interest
of, any Acquired Company; (2) equity appreciation, phantom stock, restricted
stock right, profit participation or similar right with respect to any
Acquired Company; or (3) voting trust, proxy or other Contract with respect to
any equity interest of any Acquired Company.

(a) Authority and Authorization. With the exception of receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and each Ancillary Document to be executed by the Company has
been duly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate action on the

and effect. Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer and
Buyer Subsidiary of this Agreement and each Ancillary Document to be executed
by the Company, this Agreement and each Ancillary Document to be executed by
the Company is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the
extent enforceability may be limited by any Enforcement Limitation.

 

(b) Conflicts. Except as listed in _Schedule 3.3(b)_, neither the execution
nor delivery by the Company of this Agreement nor any Ancillary Document nor
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated herein does or
will (with or without the passage of time or giving of notice): (1) constitute
a breach of, violate, conflict with or give rise to or create any right or
obligation under any Organizational Document of any Acquired Company; (2)
violate any Applicable Law or Order; or (3) constitute a material breach or
violation of or a default under, conflict with or give rise to or create any
right of any Person other than any Acquired Company to accelerate, increase,
terminate, modify or cancel any right or obligation in a manner adverse to the
Business or result in the creation of any Encumbrance, other than a
Permitted Encumbrance, under, any Contract to which any Acquired Company is a
party or by which any asset of any Acquired Company is bound; except with
respect to clauses (2) and (3) where any such violation, breach, default,
conflict, right or result is not material to the Company and the Acquired
Companies taken as a whole.

(c) Consents. Except as listed in  _Schedule 3.3(c)_, no consent or approval
by, notification to or filing with any Person is required in connection with
the Companys execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document or the Companys consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein or therein, except where the failure to obtain any such
consent or approval, provide any such notification or make any such filing is
not material to the Company and the Acquired Companies taken as a whole. "
_Consent_ " means each consent, approval, notice or filing listed in _Schedule
3.3(c)_. " _Required Consent_" means each Consent labeled as a Required
Consent in _Schedule 3.3(c)_. 

3.4 _Financial Statements and Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) Financial Statements Defined. _Schedule 3.4(a)_ contains a true, correct
and complete copy of the following: 

(1) the (A) audited balance sheet of the Company on a consolidated basis as of
each of June 30, 2012 and 2011 (the latter of such dates is the " _Annual
Balance Sheet Date_" and such balance sheet as of the Annual Balance Sheet
Date is the

 



23  " _Annual Balance Sheet_ "); (B) audited income statements and statements of
cash flow of the Company on a consolidated basis for the fiscal year ended on
each of the Annual Balance Sheet Date and December 31, 2011 and 2010; and (C)

auditors (collectively, the " _Annual Financial Statements_"); and 

(2) the unaudited (A) balance sheet of the Business on a consolidated basis,
as of September 30, 2012 (such date is the " _Interim Balance Sheet Date_"
and such balance sheet is the " _Interim Balance Sheet_"); and (B) income
statement of the Business, on a consolidated basis, for the 3-month period
ended on the Interim Balance Sheet Date (collectively, the " _Interim
Financial Statements_" and, together with the Annual Financial Statements,
the " _Financial Statements_ ").

 

(b) Financial Statements. The Financial Statements (1) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied by the Company, (2) were prepared
in accordance with, and are consistent with, the books and Records of the
Company, (3) were, with respect to each unaudited Financial Statement of the
Business, prepared in a manner consistent with the manner of preparation of
the directly related audited Financial Statements of the Company and (4)
fairly present, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities and
financial condition of the Company and the Business at their respective dates
and the results of operations of the Company and the Business for the
respective periods covered thereby, except that the Interim Financial
Statements are subject to normal year-end adjustments (which adjustments would
not be material, individually or in the aggregate) and any notes included
therewith would not be material, individually or in the aggregate, and would
be consistent in all material respects with the notes to the Annual Financial
Statements.

 

(c) Undisclosed Liabilities. The Business has no Liability of a kind required
by GAAP to be set forth on the face of a balance sheet, except for any
Liability (1) set forth on the face of the Interim Balance Sheet (regardless
of whether in any note thereto), (2) listed in _Schedule 3.4(c)_, (3) that
has arisen in its Ordinary Course of Business since the Interim Balance Sheet
Date (which does not arise out of, relate to or result from and which is not
in the nature of and was not caused by any breach of Contract, breach of
warranty, tort, infringement or other violation of Applicable Law) or (4)
under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or otherwise in connection with
the Transactions.

(d) Solvency and No Material Adverse Effect. As of the Effective Time, each
Acquired Company will be solvent and will be able to pay its debts in the
Ordinary Course of Business as those debts become due and payable. Since the
Interim Balance Sheet Date, no incident or incidents have occurred which,
individually or collectively, constitute a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company and the Acquired Companies taken as a whole.

 



24 3.5 _Compliance with Law_.

 

Except as disclosed on _Schedule 3.5_ , since January 1, 2009, no Acquired
Company is in material violation of any Applicable Laws relating to the
operation or ownership of the Business. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing:

(a)  _Taxes_.

(1) All Tax Returns that were required to be filed by, on behalf of or with
respect to any Acquired Company or any Affiliated Group of which any Acquired
Company is or was a member were timely filed on or before the applicable due
date (taking into account any extension of such due date). All such Tax
Returns were true and correct in all material respects. All Taxes (including
estimated Taxes) due and owing by or with respect to any Acquired Company or
any such Affiliated Group were paid when due (whether or not shown as due on
any Tax Return).

 

(2) Since January 1, 2006, no claim has been made in writing by an authority
in a jurisdiction where an Acquired Company does not currently file a Tax
Return that such Acquired Company is or may be subject to taxation by such
jurisdiction.

(3) All Taxes that any Acquired Company is or was required to withhold in
connection with any amount paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, shareholder, nonresident, creditor or other third party have been
duly withheld or collected and have been paid, to the extent due and owing, to
the proper Governmental Authority.

(4) On the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no Tax audit
or Tax Proceeding pending or Threatened against or otherwise with respect to
any Acquired Company.

 

(5) No Acquired Company has in effect any waiver of any statute of limitations
regarding any Tax or agreed to any extension of time, that remains in effect,
regarding the assessment of any Tax deficiency.

(6) No Acquired Company will be required to include any item of income in, or
exclude any item of deduction from, Taxable income for any Taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of any: (A) change
in method of accounting for a Taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date; (B) closing agreement" as described in section 7121 of the Code or other
agreement with a Governmental Authority (or any similar provision of any
Applicable Law) executed on or before the Closing Date; (C) intercompany

(7) No Acquired Company or any predecessor thereof has been a member of a
group (including an Affiliated Group) with which it has filed or been
included in a combined, consolidated or unitary Income Tax Tax Return, other
than the group in which it is currently a member. No Acquired Company has been
a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity agreement, Tax sharing agreement,
Tax allocation agreement or similar Contract, other than with respect to such
group in which it is

 



25  currently a member. No Acquired Company or any predecessor thereof is liable
for any Tax of any taxpayer other than an Acquired Company under Treasury
Regulations section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of any Applicable
Law), as a transferee or successor, by Contract or otherwise, for any Taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date, other than with respect to such
group in which such Acquired Company is currently a member.

corporation" as such term is defined in section 355(a)(1) of the Code.

(9) No Acquired Company is or has been a United States real property holding
corporation (as defined in section 897(c)(2) of the Code) during the
applicable period specified in section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

 

(10) There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other Contract covering any
current or former employee or independent contractor of any Acquired Company
that, considered individually or considered collectively with any other such
Contract, will, or could reasonably be expected to, give rise directly or
indirectly to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant
to section 280G of the Code. No Acquired Company is a party to any Contract,
nor does it have any obligation or other Liability, to compensate any
individual for excise Taxes paid pursuant to section 4999 of the Code.

 

(11) The unpaid Taxes of the Acquired Companies, as a whole, (A) did not, as
of the Interim Balance Sheet Date, exceed the reserve for Tax Liability
(rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes) set forth on the Interim Balance
Sheet and (B) do not exceed such reserve on the Interim Balance Sheet, as
adjusted for the passage of time since the Interim Balance Sheet Date in
accordance with the past custom and practice of the Acquired Companies. Since
the Interim Balance Sheet Date, no Acquired Company has incurred any Liability
for any Tax arising from extraordinary gains or losses outside its Ordinary
Course of Business.

all Environmental Laws in all material respects.

(2) Each Acquired Company has obtained all material Environmental Permits
necessary to conduct the Business and to own, use and operate its assets

made available to Buyer a true, correct and complete copy of each such Permit
and each such Permit is listed in _Schedule 3.5_.

 



26 (d) _Applicable Laws Relevant to Products_. Since January 1, 2006,
the manufacture, sale, assembly, repair and servicing of products and sub-
assemblies by each Acquired Company has been in compliance in all material
respects with all Applicable Laws, including Section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act (15 U.S.C. §45).

3.6 _Litigation and Orders_. Except as listed in _Schedule 3.6_, (a) there is
no claim or other Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
Threatened against any Acquired Company or to which any Acquired Company is a
party and (b) no Acquired Company is subject to any Order.

 

3.7 _Contracts_.

(a) Other than Contracts that are reasonably expected to expire prior to the
Closing without any liability on the part of the Company or any Acquired
Company, _Schedule 3.7_ constitutes a true, correct and complete list of the
following Contracts relating to the Business to which any Acquired Company is
a party or by which any of its assets relating to the Business is bound (each
Contract so listed or required to be so listed being a " _Major Contract_")
and each Major Contract is listed under a heading in _Schedule 3.7_ that
corresponds with the applicable clause among the following to which such Major
Contract relates:

 

(1) each Contract regarding any employment, severance or change-of-control

4.1 _Organization and Good Standing_. Each of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary (a)
is a duly organized and validly existing Delaware corporation in good standing
under the laws of Delaware and (b) has full corporate power and authority to
own and lease its properties and assets and conduct its business. Each of
Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary is duly qualified and in good standing to do
business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the ownership
and leasing of its properties and assets or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or
in good standing will not materially and adversely affect Buyers or Buyer
Subsidiarys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated herein.

 

4.2 _Authority and Authorization; Conflicts; Consents_.

 

(a) Authority and Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and each Ancillary Document of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary have
been duly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate action with
respect to Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary, as applicable, and each such
authorization and approval remains in full force and effect. Assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
and each Ancillary Document of the Company, this Agreement is, and each
Ancillary Document of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary at Closing will be, the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary, as
applicable, enforceable against Buyer, or Buyer Subsidiary, as applicable, in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent enforceability may be limited
by any Enforcement Limitation.

 

(b) Conflicts. Neither the execution nor delivery by Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary
of this Agreement or by Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary of any Ancillary Document
nor consummation by Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated
herein or therein does or will (with or without the passage of time or giving
of notice): (1) constitute a breach of, violate, conflict with or give rise
to or create any right or obligation under any Organizational Document of
Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary; (2) violate any Applicable Law or Order; or (3)
constitute a breach or violation of or a default under, conflict with or give
rise to or create any right of any Person other than Buyer to accelerate,
increase, terminate, modify or cancel any right or obligation under, any
Contract to which Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary is a party, except where
such breach, violation, default, conflict or right described in clause (2) or
(3) above will not materially and adversely affect Buyers or Buyer Subsidiary
ability to consummate the Transactions.

 

4.3 _Buyer SEC Reports; Capitalization, Etc_.

(a) Buyer has filed with the SEC all forms, reports and documents required to
be filed by Buyer since January 1, 2010 (collectively, the " _Buyer SEC
Reports_ "). As of their 

 



42  respective dates, the Buyer SEC Reports (including any Buyer SEC Reports
filed after the Signing Date until the Closing) (i) were prepared in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act
or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
SEC thereunder applicable to such Buyer SEC Reports and (ii) did not at the
time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
None of Buyers subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC. The chief executive officer and the chief financial
officer of Buyer have signed, and Buyer has filed with the SEC, all
certifications required by Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
such certifications contain no qualifications or exceptions to the matters
certified therein and have not been modified or withdrawn, and neither Buyer
nor any of its officers has received notice from any Governmental Authority
questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of
filing of such certifications. As used in this  _Section 4.3_, the term
"file" shall be broadly construed to include any manner in which a document or
information is filed with the SEC.

(b) At the time they were filed with the SEC, the consolidated financial
statements of Buyer included in most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q
under the Exchange Act complied as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto as then in effect, had been prepared in
accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
presented the consolidated financial position of Buyer and its subsidiaries as
of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of the interim
financial statements to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of notes).
Buyer has no indebtedness or Losses of any kind required to be reflected in or
reserved against in balance sheets prepared in accordance with GAAP other
than those (i) fully reflected in or reserved against in the unaudited balance
sheet of Buyer contained in the Buyer SEC Reports as of September 30, 2012
(the " _Buyer Balance Sheet_ ") or (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of
business since the date of the Buyer Balance Sheet. Since the date of the
Buyer Balance Sheet, there has not been (i) any material adverse effect with
respect to the business, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or
results of operations of Buyer, (ii) any material change by Buyer in its
accounting methods, principles or practices, except as required by concurrent
changes in GAAP, Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act or Applicable Law, or
(iii) any material revaluation by Buyer of any of its assets, including
writing down the value of capitalized inventory or writing off notes or
accounts receivable other than in the ordinary course of business. As of
the Effective Time, taking into account the consummation of the Transactions,
Buyer and each subsidiary of Buyer will be solvent and will be able to pay its
debts in the Ordinary Course of Business as those debts become due and
payable.

 

(c) The authorized capital stock of Buyer consists of: (i) 100,000,000 shares

outstanding number as of the date hereof; (ii) 25,000,000 shares of preferred
stock of Buyer, par value $0.01 per share, of which no shares are issued and
outstanding as of the date hereof. All of the issued and outstanding shares

 



43  of Buyer Stock and preferred stock of Buyer are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non assessable and are not subject to preemptive rights
created by statute, the Buyers Organizational Documents or any agreement to
which the Buyer is a party or by which it is bound. All shares of Buyer Stock
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement have been reserved for issuance, duly
authorized and, when issued as contemplated by this Agreement, will be
validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights, and
issued in compliance with applicable securities laws (assuming the accuracy of
all representations made by any Selling Parties in any of the documents
contemplated by this Agreement).

(d) Except as disclosed in its filings with the SEC pursuant to Sections
13 and 15 of the Exchange Act, there is no existing option, warrant, call,
right or Contract of any character to which Buyer is a party requiring, and
there are no securities of Buyer outstanding which upon conversion or exchange
would require, the issuance, sale or transfer of any additional shares of
capital stock or other equity securities of Buyer or other securities
convertible into, exchangeable for or evidencing the right to subscribe for or
purchase shares of capital stock or other equity securities of Buyer. Buyer
is not a party to any voting trust or other Contract with respect to the
voting, redemption, registration under the Securities Act, sale, transfer or
other disposition of the capital stock or other equity securities of Buyer.

4.4 _Litigation and Orders_. There is no claim or other Proceeding pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Buyer, Threatened against Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary
or to which Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary is a party, in each case that will
affect Buyers or Buyer Subsidiarys ability to consummate the Transactions.
Neither Buyer nor Buyer Subsidiary is subject to any Order, in each case that
will affect Buyers or Buyer Subsidiarys ability to consummate the
Transactions.

4.5 _Brokers_. Neither Buyer nor Buyer Subsidiary has obligation or other
Liability to any broker, finder or similar intermediary that would cause the
Company to become liable for payment of any fee or expense with respect
thereto.

4.6 _Investment Representations_. Buyer is an investor experienced (or owned
or managed by Persons experienced) in evaluating investments and, in
particular (either on its own or with advisors), digital information storage
systems, and has the knowledge, experience and resources to enable it to
evaluate and to bear the risks of the investment represented by the Company
Stock. Buyer is eligible to file registration statements on Form S-3,
including but not limited to satisfying the "Registrant Requirements" of
General Instruction I.A. to Form S-3 as such Form S-3 is in effect as of the
date hereof.

4.7 _Availability of Funds_. As of the date hereof, Buyer has sufficient
funds available to it to pay the Total Final Merger Consideration Amount and
the fees and expenses of Buyer and Buyer Subsidiary related to the
Transactions and to enable Buyer to perform all of its obligations under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents. Buyer knows of no circumstance or
condition that could be reasonably expected to prevent the availability at the
Closing of such cash. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby is not subject to any financing contingency
or condition. To the Knowledge of Buyer, there is no reason to suspect that
the monies used to fund the purchase of the Company or the transactions
contemplated hereby have been or will be derived from or related to any
illegal activities,

 



44  including money laundering activities. To the Knowledge of Buyer, there is
no reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist which would cause
it or any of its Affiliates to be (a) deemed to be operating in violation in
any respect of the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, the US PATRIOT Act, any order issued
with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys
Office of Foreign Assets Control, (b) listed on the U.S. Department of the

terrorism statute, rule or regulation.

from and against all Taxes with respect to any (1) Acquired Company with

and (3) Person (other than an Acquired Company) imposed on an Acquired
Company for any period as a transferee or successor with respect to a

50 (b) Tax Returns. The Acquired Companies shall, at the Acquired
Companies expense, prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for the Acquired Companies for all periods ending on or

the Acquired Companies shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes with respect
to such periods. The Buyer shall, at the Buyers expense, prepare or cause to
be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company for
all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date and which are due after
the Closing Date. All Tax Returns referred to herein shall be prepared in
accordance with past practices of the Company at least fifteen (15) Business
Days before they are due. The Buyer shall permit the Selling Parties
Representative a reasonable period of time, but not less than fifteen (15)
Business Days, to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing.
The Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall consider in good faith any
changes to each such Tax Return that are reasonably requested by the Selling
Parties Representative. The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and

Affiliates to, cooperate in all reasonable respects with respect to Tax
matters and provide one another with such information as is reasonably
requested to enable the requesting Party to complete and file all Tax Returns
it may be required to file (or cause to be filed) with respect to any
Acquired Company, to respond to Tax audits, inquiries or other Tax
Proceedings and to otherwise satisfy Tax requirements. Such cooperation also

relevant Tax notices, forms or other communications received from or sent to
any Governmental Authority and (2) reasonably requested copies of all relevant
Tax Returns together with accompanying schedules and related workpapers,
documents relating to rulings, audits or other Tax determinations by any
Governmental Authority and records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of
property.

(d) Straddle Periods. In the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any
Income Taxes with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based
on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (and for such purpose, the Taxable year of any pass-through entity will
be deemed to terminate at such time) and the amount of any other Tax with
respect to an Acquired Company with respect to any Straddle Period which
relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period will be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the total number of days in
such Straddle Period.

(e) Transfer Taxes. Each Party will pay half of all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording

Buyers behalf) regarding any acquisition of any Acquired Companys capital
stock, assets or business, in whole or in part (by purchase, merger, tender
offer, statutory share exchange, joint venture or otherwise), except sales of
inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Company. The
Company will, and the Company will cause each Affiliate and other
representative or agent of the Company to, immediately terminate all such
discussions or negotiations that may be in progress on the date hereof.

Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to have such registration
statement declared effective as soon as possible, will maintain such

Buyer will use all commercially reasonable efforts to (a) register or qualify
such stock to be included in such registration statement under such
securities laws or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any holder thereof
will reasonably request (provided Buyer will not be required to qualify to do
business or to file a general consent to service of process in any
jurisdiction) and (b) keep such registrations or qualifications in effect and
comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of offers, sales and
dealings therein in such jurisdictions until the earlier of (a) such times
as all of the distribution of such stock pursuant to the registration
statement has been completed or (b) twelve (12) months after such registration
statement became effective. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each of
such holder against any losses, expenses, claims, damages or liabilities,
joint or several, including actions, proceedings, investigations, settlements,
judgments and fines, to which such holder may

 



52  become subject under the Securities Act, or otherwise, insofar as such
expenses, losses, claims, damages, liabilities, actions, proceedings,
investigations, settlements, judgments and fines arise out of or are based
upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained or incorporated by reference in such registration statement under
which such stock is registered under the Securities Act, or any
preliminary, final or free writing prospectus contained or incorporated by
reference therein or furnished by Buyer to any such holder or any amendment or
supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or in connection with
any such registration statement any violation by Buyer of the Securities Act,

regulation under any of the foregoing, and will reimburse such holder for any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are
incurred. Each such holder shall indemnify and hold harmless, severally and
not jointly, Buyer against any losses, expenses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, including actions, proceedings, investigations,
settlements, judgments and fines, to which Buyer may become subject under the
Securities Act, or otherwise, insofar as such expenses, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, actions, proceedings, investigations, settlements,
judgments and fines arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact, or any omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading, contained in any information
expressly provided by such holder for inclusion in such registration statement
under which such stock is registered under the Securities Act, or in any
preliminary, final or free writing prospectus contained or incorporated by
reference therein or in any amendment or supplement thereto, and will
reimburse Buyer for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by Buyer
in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such
expenses are incurred; provided, however, that no such holder shall have any
liability to Buyer in excess of the amount of proceeds (less any commissions
or brokerage fees incurred by such holder) actually received by such holder
from the sale of such holders shares pursuant to such registration
statement.

(b) As soon as it is possible under applicable laws to remove the Securities
Act legends restricting transfer of the Buyer Stock from the certificate
representing the Buyer Stock held in the Escrow Account, Buyer shall
immediately (and within 10 days of such eligibility) take all commercially
reasonable steps required to remove all legends restricting transfer of the
Buyer Stock from the Buyer Stock certificate in the Escrow Account, including
but not limited to, at Buyers sole expense, (i) causing a nationally
recognized law firm to issue an opinion of counsel stating that the transfer
restriction legend may be removed and (ii) exchanging the share of Buyer Stock
held in the Escrow Account in the name of the Escrow Agent at the time of such
eligibility for an equivalent number of shares without a restrictive legend.
If, for any reason, the Buyer Stock held in the Escrow Account sixteen months
following the Closing Date continues to bear any legend restricting transfer,
Buyer shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 with respect to such
Buyer Stock with the SEC no later than fifteen (15) days thereafter, and take
all actions, and be subject to all obligations, with respect to such
registration statement as described above in Section 5.10(a); provided all
time periods in Section 5.10(a) shall instead be measured from the date the
Buyer Stock is released to the Escrow Recipients from the Escrow Account.

 



53 5.11 _Section 280G_. To the extent applicable, the Selling Parties will
use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) solicit waivers from each Person
who is subject to United States Tax and has a right to any payments and/or
benefits as a result of or in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein that would be deemed to constitute "excess parachute payments" (within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ "), and
(ii) solicit the approval of the Stockholders of the Company in a manner
intended to comply with Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and 280G(b)(5)(B) of the

contemplated hereby. Buyer will take all action necessary to cause the shares
of Buyer Stock to be issued at the Effective Time to be approved for listing
on the New York Stock Exchange at or prior to the Effective Time and will
take all action necessary to cause any additional shares of Buyer Stock to be
issued after the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement to be approved for

(e) any Pre Closing Taxes, but only as and to the extent specified in _Section
5.8(a)_.

8.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the other terms and limitations of
this _Article 8_, subsequent to the Effective Time , Buyer will indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Selling Party and each of the Selling Partys
Other Indemnified Persons from and against all Losses as a result of any:

 

(a) breach by Buyer of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in Article
4 of this Agreement at Closing as if given at Closing or inaccuracy in any
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_; or

(b) breach by Buyer of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this
Agreement.

8.3 _Certain Limitations and Other Matters Regarding Claims_. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement:

(a) [**]

 

(b) Cap Respecting Buyer Indemnification Claims. Subject to the other terms of
this _Article 8_, the maximum amount that Buyer and each of Buyers Other
Indemnified Persons may recover from each Escrow Recipient pursuant to
_Section 5.8_ or _Section 8.1_ will not exceed an amount equal to such
Escrow Recipients Pro-Rata Percentage of the Initial Indemnification Escrow
Amount (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that following disbursement
of the Escrow Account, with respect to each Escrow Recipient, the Cap will
equal the amount of the Escrow Consideration actually received by such Escrow
Recipient. No claim for indemnification may be made under _Section 5.8_ or
_Section 8.1_ by Buyer or any of the Buyers Other Indemnified Persons
against any Stockholder, Selling Party or Escrow Recipient for any Losses
which cannot be recovered from amounts then remaining, if any, in the Escrow
Account, which have not already been paid in satisfaction of prior
indemnification claims, except in the event of a claim for indemnification
against the Escrow Recipients as a result of indemnification required by
_Section 5.8_ following disbursement of the Escrow Account (in which case the
proviso of the first sentence of this _Section 8.3(b)_ shall apply).

(c) Threshold Respecting Selling Parties Indemnification Claims. No claim for
indemnification may be made under _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_,
unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses of Selling Party and each of
the Selling Partys Other Indemnified Persons that may be claimed thereunder
exceeds the Threshold; provided, however, that if such aggregate amount of
Losses exceeds the Threshold, then a claim for indemnification may be made
under _Section 8.2_ for all of such Losses (including those equal to or less
than the Threshold), subject to the other terms of this _Article 8_.

Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
---|--- 
 



59 (d) Cap Respecting Selling Parties Indemnification Claims.
Buyers obligations under _Section 8.2_, in the aggregate, will not exceed
an amount equal to $11,950,000, subject to the other terms of this _Article
8_.

(e) Treatment of Fraudulent Representations. Notwithstanding the foregoing
terms of this _Section 8.3_, _Section 8.3(a)_, _8.3(b)_ , _8.3(c)_ or
_8.3(d)_ will not limit any claim for indemnification under _Section 8.1(a)_
with respect to the breach of any representation or warranty of the Company in
Article 3 of this Agreement or any in accuracy in any certificate delivered
pursuant to  _Section 1.12(c)_ and _Section 7.1(c)_ which constitutes
intentional fraud against Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of this
_Section 8.3_, _Section 8.3(a)_, _8.3(b)_ , _8.3(c)_ or  _8.3(d)_ will not
limit any claim for indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_ with respect to
the breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer in Article 4 of this
Agreement or any in accuracy in any certificate delivered pursuant to
_Section 7.2(c)_ which constitutes intentional fraud against the Company. For
the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that Buyer or any of Buyers Other
Indemnified Persons are entitled to recover Losses outside of the Escrow
Account due to this _Section 8.3(e)_, the liability of the Indemnifying
Parties for such Losses outside of the Escrow Account shall be several and not
joint and allocated based on each Indemnifying Partys Pro-Rata Percentage
and will be limited to the amount of the Total Final Merger Consideration
Amount actually received by such Person.

 

(f) Per Claim Test. No claim for indemnification may be made under _Section
8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.2(a)_ with respect to any single Loss, or related
Losses arising out of substantially similar facts and circumstances, not in
excess of $10,000.

(g) Knowledge Not Limiting. One purpose of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements herein is to shift or allocate the risk and
responsibility for certain matters among the Parties. No right or obligation
under this _Article 8_ will be waived or otherwise affected by any knowledge
(of any form or type) of Buyer or by any investigation, due diligence or
verification by or on behalf of Buyer on or before the date hereof or at or
before Closing. All representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
herein will be deemed material and relied upon by each Party, and none will be
waived by any failure to pursue any action or consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein, except to the extent stated herein.

(h) No Recovery for Punitive Damages. No Claiming Party shall have any right
to seek or obtain indemnification under this Agreement for any exemplary or
punitive damages, regardless of whether any such damages are deemed to result
from the failure or inadequacy of any exclusive or other remedy, unless such
exemplary or punitive damages are the subject of an indemnifiable Third Party
Claim pursuant to a final, non-appealable judgment.

(i) Sole and Exclusive Remedies. Notwithstanding any other term of this
Agreement, subsequent to the Effective Time the sole and exclusive remedies of
Buyer, each of Buyers Other Indemnified Persons, the Selling Parties and
each of the Selling Partys Other Indemnified Persons for any Losses or
Liabilities arising out of, relating to or resulting from any

 



60  breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or the interpretation, making, performance, breach or
termination thereof, will be strictly and exclusively limited to those
contained in this _Article 8_. Except to the extent expressly stated herein
to the contrary, the rights and obligations (including remedies) arising out
of, relating to, resulting from or in connection with any Ancillary Document
are not limited by this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, to the
maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Party hereby waives and
(if necessary to give effect to this _Section 8.3_) will cause each of its
Other Indemnified Persons to waive, all claims, causes of action and other
remedies of such Party against each other as a matter of Contract, equity,
under or based upon any Applicable Law or otherwise (including for
rescission), except to the extent expressly stated in this Agreement.

(1) Each Party, on behalf of itself and each of its Other Indemnified Persons,
hereby expressly waives any rights or benefits available under the provisions
of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which reads as follows:

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH
IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

(2) Each Party, on behalf of itself and each such Person, fully understands
the statutory language of said statute and nevertheless elects to and hereby
does waive all claims it may have against any of them expressly provided in
_Section 8.3(i)_, whether known or unknown, arising from the subject matter
of this waiver and specifically waives any rights which it may have under said
statute. Each Party, on behalf of itself and each such Person, fully
understands that if the facts with respect to this waiver are found hereafter
to be other than or different from the facts now believed to be true, it
expressly accepts and assumes the risk of such possible difference in
fact notwithstanding any such differences.

(j) Other Factors Not Limiting. The terms of this _Article 8_ will
be enforceable regardless of whether Liability is based on past, present or
future acts, claims or legal requirements and regardless of any sole,
concurrent, contributory, comparative or similar negligence, or of any sole,
concurrent, strict or similar Liability, of a Person seeking indemnification
(or of any of its Other Indemnified Persons).

8.4 _Certain Survival Periods_.

(a) Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Subject to _Section
8.4(b)_, each representation or warranty herein, and each covenant and
agreement set forth in _Sections 5.2_, _5.3(b)_ , _5.4_ , _5.5(b)_ , _5.5(c)_
, will survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and remain in
full force and effect until the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date, at which time such representation, warranty or covenant will
expire and terminate and no indemnification obligation will be associated
therewith or based thereon, except that any representation or warranty made
through intentional fraud will survive until all Liability

 



61  hereunder relating thereto is barred by all applicable statutes of
limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
covenants and agreements contained in  _Sections 5.1_, _5.3(a)_ , _5.5(a)_ ,
_5.6_ , _5.9_ , and _5.11_ shall not survive, and shall expire and terminate
as of, the Effective Time and no indemnification obligation will be associated
therewith or based thereon after the Effective Time.

(b) Final Determination of Claims. Notwithstanding _Section 8.4(a)_,
for each claim for indemnification hereunder regarding a representation,
warranty or covenant that is made before expiration of such representation,
warranty or covenant, such claim and associated right to indemnification
(including any right to pursue such indemnification, including via any
Proceeding) will not terminate before final determination and satisfaction of
such claim.

(c) Survival of Certain Covenants and Agreements. Except as otherwise provided
in _Section 8.4(a)_ and _Section 8.4(b)_, each covenant and agreement (
_i.e.,_ other than representations and warranties) herein, and all associated
rights to indemnification, will survive Closing and will continue in full
force thereafter until duly performed and until all potential Liability with
respect thereto is barred by all applicable statutes of limitation, subject
to any applicable limitation stated herein.

(d) Effect. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is the
intention and agreement of the Parties that the foregoing survival periods and
termination dates supersede any applicable statute of limitations applicable
to such representations, warranties and covenants.

8.5 _Notice of Claims and Procedures_.

 

(a) Notice of Claims. A Party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "
_Claiming Party_ " and for purposes of this Agreement if any Selling Party
would qualify as a Claiming Party pursuant to this Agreement, the Selling
Parties Representative must act on behalf of such Selling Party) will give
the Party obligated to provide such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying
Party_" and for purposes of this Agreement if any Selling Party would qualify
as an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement, the Selling Parties
Representative must act on behalf of such Selling Party) prompt notice of any
claim, for which such Claiming Party proposes to demand indemnification, (1)
by a Person that is not a Party nor an Other Indemnified Person (such a claim
being a " _Third Party Claim_" and such notice of such Third Party Claim
being the " _Initial Claim Notice_") or (2) that does not involve a Third
Party Claim, in each case specifying the amount and nature of such claim (to
the extent known). Thereafter, the Claiming Party will give the Indemnifying
Party, promptly after the Claiming Partys (or any of its applicable Other
Indemnified Persons) receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all documents
(including court papers) received or delivered by the Claiming Party (or any
such Other Indemnified Person) relating to any such Third Party Claim. The
failure to promptly give such notice or to promptly give such copies will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability hereunder, except if the
Indemnifying Party was prejudiced thereby, but only to the extent of such
prejudice.

(b) Access and Cooperation. Each Party will, and will cause its Other
Indemnified Persons to, cooperate and assist in all reasonable respects
regarding such Third

 



62  Party Claim, including by promptly making available to such other Party (and
its legal counsel and other professional advisers with a reasonable need to
know) all books and records of such Person relating to such Third Party
Claim, subject to reasonable confidentiality precautions.

(c) Defense and Participation Regarding Third Party Claims. This _Section
8.5(c)_ relates only to Third Party Claims.

(1) Election to Conduct Defense. Promptly after receiving an Initial Claim
Notice under _Section 8.5(a)_, the Indemnifying Party will have the option to
conduct the Defense of such Third Party Claim, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, except if (A) the aggregate amount of the potential
obligations of the Claiming Party (or its Other Indemnified Persons) regarding
such Third Party Claim exceeds the maximum obligations of the Indemnifying
Party under this Agreement regarding such Third Party Claim, (B) there is a
reasonable probability that such Third Party Claim will materially and
adversely affect the Claiming Party (or any of its Other Indemnified Persons),
other than as a result of money damages, or (C) the Indemnifying Party fails
to provide the Claiming Party with evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Claiming Party that the Indemnifying Party has the financial resources to
actively and diligently conduct the Defense of such Third Party Claim and
fulfill the Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligations hereunder with
respect thereto. To elect to conduct such Defense, the Indemnifying Party must
give written notice of such election to the Claiming Party within 10 days (or
within the shorter period, if any, during which a Defense must be commenced
for the preservation of rights) after the Claiming Party gives the
corresponding Initial Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party (otherwise, such
right to conduct such Defense will be deemed waived). If the Indemnifying
Party validly makes such election, it will nonetheless lose such right to
conduct such Defense if it fails to continue to actively and diligently
conduct such Defense.

 

(2) Conduct of Defense, Participation and Settlement. If the Indemnifying
Party conducts the Defense of such Third Party Claim, then (A) the Claiming
Party may participate, at its own expense (except that the Indemnifying Party
will be responsible for the fees and expenses of the Claiming Partys counsel
(but not more than one law firm per jurisdiction) if the Claiming Party
reasonably concludes that counsel to the Indemnifying Party has a conflict of
interest), in such Defense (including any Proceeding regarding such Third
Party Claim) and will have the right to receive copies of all notices,
pleadings or other similar submissions regarding such Defense, (B) the
Indemnifying Party will keep the Claiming Party reasonably informed of all
matters material to such Defense and Third Party Claim at all stages
thereof, (C) the Claiming Party will not (and will cause its Other
Indemnified Persons not to) admit Liability with respect to, or compromise or
settle, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written
consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), (D) there will be no compromise or settlement of such Third
Party Claim without the consent of the Claiming Party (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and (E) the Indemnifying
Partys election to conduct the Defense of such Third Party Claim will
conclusively establish the Indemnifying Partys obligation to indemnify the
Claiming Party with respect to such Third Party Claim hereunder; provided,
however, that the amount of indemnifiable Losses with respect to such Third
Party Claim, if any, shall be determined only as provided in this Article 8\.

 



63 (3) Indemnifying Party Does Not Conduct Defense. If the Indemnifying Party
does not validly elect to conduct the Defense of a Third Party Claim (other
than pursuant to _Section 8.5(c)(1)_) or does not preserve such option
(including by failing to commence such Defense within 10 days following
receipt of such Initial Claim Notice or within the shorter period, if any,
during which a Defense must be commenced for the preservation of rights), then
the Claiming Party may conduct the Defense of such Third Party Claim in any
manner that the Claiming Party reasonably deems appropriate, at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party (subject to the other limitations of this _Article
8_), and the Claiming Party will have the right to compromise or settle such
Third Party Claim after receiving the consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

8.6  _Materiality Qualifiers_. For purposes of this _Article 8_, for the
specific purpose of determining the amount of Losses resulting from, directly
or indirectly, a breach of a representation or warranty in this Agreement,
but specifically not for purposes of determining whether a breach occurred,
all Materiality Qualifiers will be ignored and each such representation and
warranty will be read and interpreted without regard to any Materiality
Qualifier.

 

8.7 _Mitigation_. Each Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate each Loss for which such Party is or may become entitled to be
indemnified hereunder.

8.8 _Effect of Adjustments_. Any Loss for which a Party would otherwise be
obligated to provide indemnification hereunder will be offset to the extent
(but only to the extent) such Loss is reflected in the adjustments to the
Total Final Merger Consideration under _Article 1_. Except to the
extent expressly agreed otherwise (but subject to the preceding sentence),
resolution of the matters in _Article 1_ is for such purpose only and will
not waive or otherwise limit any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement herein nor preclude any remedy or other right hereunder for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement herein.

 

8.9 _Effect of Officer s Certificates_. For the avoidance of doubt, any
written certification by a Person (or any officer thereof on behalf of such
Person) of the accuracy of any representation or warranty in _Article 3_ or
_Article 4_, as the case may be, of this Agreement (or of any other matter),
including any certification contemplated in _Section 7.1(c)_ or _7.2(c)_ ,
will be deemed to constitute the making or re-making of such representation or
warranty by such Person (or a representation or warranty hereunder regarding
such other matter) at the time of such certification in the manner and to the
extent stated in such certification, including for purposes of _Section
8.1(a)_ and _8.2(a)_.

8.10 _Escrow_.

(a) To secure the indemnification obligations of the Company under this
Agreement, the Initial Indemnification Escrow Amount, the Initial
Reconciliation Escrow

 



64  Amount and the Litigation Fees Escrow Amount (if applicable), and, to fund
the activities of the Selling Parties Representative, the Selling Parties
Representative Escrow Amount (which shall be under the control of the Selling
Parties Representative pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_), will all be deposited
into an escrow account (the " _Escrow Account_"), each with a separate sub-
account segregated from the others and governed by the terms of an Escrow
Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 8.10_ (the " _Escrow
Agreement_").

(b) Any disbursements from the Escrow Account to the Disbursing Agent for
further payment to the Selling Parties pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, _Section 1.5(e)_,  _Section 1.13_, and _Article 10_ whether in
the form of cash or Buyer Stock is " _Escrow Consideration_."

(c) [**]

(d) Any disbursements of the Selling Parties Representative Escrow Account
to the Selling Parties Representative to fund the activities of Selling
Parties Representative will be made pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_ and
_Article 10_.

 

(e) Any disbursements from the Escrow Account in respect of an indemnification
payment to Buyer or Buyers Other Indemnified Persons in the form of Buyer
Stock shall be made valuing the stock at the average closing sale price per
share of Buyer Stock that is publically traded on the New York Stock Exchange
for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending with the trading day two
days preceding the date of the release of the Buyer Stock from the Escrow
Account.

(f) Until such time as the Buyer Stock is delivered to the Selling Parties
(or returned to or repurchased by Buyer), the Selling Parties shall be deemed
to be the beneficial owner of their Pro-Rata Percentage of the Buyer Stock
that is held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and shall possess, through the
Selling Parties Representative, all rights with respect to such shares,
except the right of possession thereof. In particular, the respective Selling
Parties, through the Selling Parties Representative as their agent and
attorney-in-fact, shall have the right to exercise any voting rights with
respect to their allocable portion of the Buyer Stock that is held pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement. In addition, any dividends (other than non-taxable
stock dividends) made with respect to the Buyer Stock that is held pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement shall be promptly paid to the Disbursing Agent for
payment to the Selling Parties in accordance with their allocable portion of
the Buyer Stock. The Selling Parties Representative shall not have any
obligation to exercise any rights with respect to such escrowed Buyer Stock
held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement unless directed to do so under the
letter agreement, dated on or around the date hereof, by and among the
Selling Parties Representative and certain of the Selling Parties.

8.11 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any indemnification
payments pursuant to this Article 8 shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
Applicable Law.

(h) The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1 through 14 (as amended

9.8 _Entire Agreement; Amendment; Waiver_. Before signing this Agreement, the
Parties had numerous conversations (including preliminary discussions, formal
negotiations and informal conversations) and generated correspondence and
other writings, in which the Parties discussed the transactions contemplated
herein and aspirations for their success. In doing so, Persons may have
expressed judgments and beliefs regarding the intentions, capabilities and 

 



69  practices of the Parties and may have forecasted future events. Each Party
acknowledges that such actions often involved an effort to be positive and
optimistic about the prospects for such transactions. Each Party also
acknowledges that all transactions contain an element of risk and that it is
normal business practice to limit the related rights and obligations of
contracting parties to only those representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements that are essential to their transactions so as to provide certainty
as to their respective rights and obligations. Therefore, each Party agrees
that, in addition to the foregoing, this Agreement, including the
Disclosure Schedules and the Updated Disclosure Schedules, constitutes the
entire Agreement between the Parties pertaining to the subject matter herein
and supersedes any other representation, warranty, covenant, assurance,
projection or agreement (whether direct or indirect, written or oral, or
statutory, express or implied) of any Party regarding such subject matter. No
supplement, modification or amendment hereof will be binding unless expressed
as such and executed in writing by each Party (except as contemplated in
_Section 9.9_). Except to the extent as may otherwise be stated herein, no
waiver of any term hereof will be binding unless expressed as such in a
document executed by the Party making such waiver (and then only to
the extent so expressed). No waiver of any term hereof will be a waiver of
any other term hereof, whether or not similar, nor will any such waiver be a
continuing waiver beyond its stated terms. Except to the extent as may
otherwise be stated herein, failure to enforce strict compliance with any
term hereof will not be a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any existing
or subsequent failure to comply.

9.9 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any right or
obligation hereunder will be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred (by
operation of law or otherwise) by any Party without the prior written consent
of each other Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), except
that each Party will have the right to assign or otherwise transfer this
Agreement or any right hereunder or delegate any obligation hereunder to (a)
a Person that does all of the following: (1) acquires or otherwise succeeds to
all or substantially all of such Partys business and assets; (2) assumes all
of such Partys obligations hereunder or such Partys obligations hereunder
that arise after such assignment, delegation or transfer; and (3) agrees to
perform or cause performance of all such assumed obligations when due; or (b)
any of its Affiliates; provided that no such assignment, delegation or
transfer under clause (a) or (b) above will relieve the assigning, delegating
or transferring Party of any obligation hereunder. This Agreement will be
binding on and inure to the benefit of the respective permitted successors
and assigns of the Parties. Any purported assignment, delegation or other
transfer not permitted by this Section is void.

9.10 _Severability; Blue-Pencil_. The terms of this Agreement will, where
possible, be interpreted and enforced so as to sustain their legality and
enforceability, read as if they cover only the specific situation to which
they are being applied and enforced to the fullest extent permissible under
Applicable Law. If any term of this Agreement is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
then all other terms of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force
and effect, and such term automatically will be amended so that it is valid,
legal and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, but
as close to the Parties original intent as is permissible.

9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute
one and the same instrument.

 



70  Such counterparts may be executed and delivered by facsimile or other
electronic means by any of the Parties, and the receiving Party may rely on
the receipt of such document so executed and delivered as if the original had
been received.

9.12 _Updated Disclosure Schedules_. From time to time on or before the
Closing Date (but before Closing), the Company may supplement or otherwise
update the Disclosure Schedules with respect to any event, circumstance or
change that first arises after the execution and delivery of this Agreement
that would make any representation or warranty in _Article 3_ inaccurate if
such representation or warranty were given at or immediately before Closing
(all of such updates, together with the Disclosure Schedules that were made a
part of this Agreement upon its execution, is the " _Updated Disclosure
Schedules_").

(a) For purposes of determining the satisfaction of the conditions in
_Section 7.1(a)_, the Disclosure Schedules will only contain the items
contained in the Disclosure Schedules upon this Agreements execution and the
Updated Disclosure Schedules will have no effect.

(b) For purposes of determining the presence of a breach of a representation
or warranty made on the Closing Date for purposes of _Article 8_ and rights
to indemnification, the Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to also contain
each item in the Updated Disclosure Schedules.

 

(c) For any purpose, the Updated Disclosure Schedules will not, and the
Disclosure Schedules will not be deemed to, contain any item that affects the
presence of breach of a representation or warranty made on the date of this
Agreement and the Updated Disclosure Schedules will not, and will not be
deemed to, prevent or cure any breach of any such representation or
warranty. 

ARTICLE 10

_SELLING PARTIES  REPRESENTATIVE _

of Transmittal to the Disbursing Agent in accordance with _Section 1.15_,
and without any further act of the Escrow Recipients, the Escrow Recipients
will be deemed to have appointed Shareholder Representative Services LLC, as
the representative (the " _Selling Parties  Representative_") of the Selling
Parties as agent and attorney-in-fact for each Escrow Recipient (except such
stockholders, if any, holding Dissenting Shares) for all matters relating to
this Agreement and to the Escrow Agreement, including to give and receive
notices and communications; to bind the Escrow Recipients to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement; to authorize disbursements from the Escrow Account in
satisfaction of claims by Buyer or Surviving Corporation; to object to such
deliveries; to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such claims; to exercise voting rights with
respect to any Buyer Stock held in the Escrow Account and receive and disburse
any dividends with respect thereto; and to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Selling Parties Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing.

 



71 (b) The Selling Parties Representative may be changed by the Escrow
Recipients from time to time upon not less than 30 days prior written notice
to Buyer, the Escrow Agent and the Selling Parties Representative, provided
that Escrow Recipients holding a majority interest of the Escrow Account agree
to such removal of Shareholder Representative Services LLC and any successors
thereto and to the identity of the substituted agent. A Selling Parties
Representative may resign at any time upon giving at least 45 days written
notice to the Escrow Recipients, the Escrow Agent and Buyer. Upon resignation
of a Selling Parties Representative, Escrow Recipients holding a majority
interest of the Escrow Account will agree on a successor Selling Parties
Representative thereto within 45 days after receiving such notice. If Escrow
Recipients holding a majority interest of the Escrow Account fail to agree
upon a successor Selling Parties Representative within such time, the
resigning Selling Parties Representative will have the right to appoint a
successor Selling Parties Representative, or if a Selling Parties
Representative is not designated within 45 days after receipt of the initial
notice, Buyer will designate a successor Selling Parties Representative. Any
successor Selling Parties Representative will execute and deliver an
instrument accepting such appointment and, without further acts, will be
vested with all the rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor
Selling Parties Representative as if originally named as Selling Parties
Representative and thereafter the resigning Selling Parties Representative
will be discharged from any further duties and Liability under this Agreement.
No bond will be required of any Selling Parties Representative. Notices or
communications to or from the Selling Parties Representative will constitute
notice to or from each Escrow Recipient for all matters relating to this
Agreement and to the Escrow Agreement.

10.2 _Authority_.

(a) The Selling Parties Representative will not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as the Selling Parties Representative while acting in good
faith (and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith). The Escrow Recipients will severally,
based on their Pro Rata Percentage of such Escrow Recipients share of the
amounts held in the Escrow Account, indemnify the Selling Parties
Representative and hold it harmless against any loss, liability, or expense
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its
duties hereunder or under the Ancillary Document, including any out-of-pocket
costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal costs reasonably incurred by
the Selling Parties Representative, in each case as such loss, liability or
expense is incurred or suffered; provided that if it is finally adjudicated
that any such loss, liability or expense or any portion thereof was primarily
caused by the bad faith or intentional misconduct of the Selling Parties
Representative, the Selling Parties Representative will reimburse the Escrow
Recipients the amount of such indemnified loss, liability or expense
attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. Subject to the
limitations of the Escrow Agreement, the Selling Parties Representative
Escrow Amount (and to the extent provided in this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, the Initial Indemnification Escrow Amount) will be available to
indemnify the Selling Parties Representative and hold the Selling Parties
Representative harmless against all loss, Liability, or expense incurred
without bad faith or intentional misconduct on the part of such Selling
Parties Representative and arising out of or

 



72  in connection with the acceptance or administration of such Selling Parties
Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses
of any legal counsel retained by the Selling Parties Representative;
provided that while this section allows the Selling Parties Representative to
be paid from the Selling Parties Representative Escrow Account, this does not
relieve the Escrow Recipients from their obligation to promptly pay such
losses, Liabilities and expenses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it
prevent the Selling Parties Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise.

 

(b) A decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Selling Parties
Representative relating to this Agreement or to the Escrow Agreement will
constitute a decision of the Escrow Recipients and will be final, binding, and
conclusive upon each such Person. Claiming Parties may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Selling Parties Representative
as being the decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Escrow Recipients.
Buyer, Surviving Corporation, and all other Claiming Parties are hereby
relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Selling
Parties Representative.

THE INSTRUCTIONS ACCOMPANYING THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL SHOULD BE READ
CAREFULLY BEFORE THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL IS COMPLETED. IF CERTIFICATES ARE
REGISTERED IN DIFFERENT NAMES, A SEPARATE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL MUST BE
SUBMITTED FOR EACH DIFFERENT REGISTERED HOLDER. SEE INSTRUCTION 4.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

On December [XX], 2012, Nexsan Corporation (" _Nexsan_ ") entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ") with Imation Corp.,
a Delaware corporation (" _Imation_ "), Naboo Merger Corp., a Delaware
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Imation (" _Buyer Subsidiary_ "),
and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, as selling parties
representative (the " _Selling Parties  Representative_"). Subject to the
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Imation will acquire Nexsan
through the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Buyer Subsidiary with and into
Nexsan, with Nexsan continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of
the Merger, Nexsan will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Imation. The
Merger closed on December [XX], 2012. Capitalized terms used herein and not
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger
Agreement.

 

The Merger Agreement provides for the payment by Imation of the Merger
consideration in the form of cash and Imation common stock to the holders of
Nexsan capital stock in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. The
per share amount of consideration to be paid to holders of shares of Nexsan
capital stock was calculated as of the effective time of the Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ ") in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and
is $[XX] per share of Nexsan Series A Preferred Stock (the " _Series A
Preferred Stock_ "), $[XX] per share Nexsan Series C Preferred Stock (the "
_Series C Preferred Stock_ ") and $[XX] per share of Nexsan common stock (the
" _Common Stock_ "). Only holders of Nexsan capital stock who are "accredited
investors," as defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, will
receive stock as part of their payment. The aggregate amount of cash and
Imation common stock consideration to be received by each Nexsan security
holder shall be reduced by such holders Pro-Rata Percentage of the Initial
Reconciliation Escrow Amount, the Litigation Fees Escrow Amount, (if
applicable) the Initial Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Selling Parties
Representative Escrow Amount.

 

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) all shares of Nexsan Series A
Preferred Stock, (ii) all shares of Nexsan Series C Preferred Stock and (iii)
all shares of Nexsan Common Stock were automatically converted into the right
to receive the Merger consideration described in the Merger Agreement.
Additionally, each of your certificate(s) formerly representing either Series
A Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and/or Common Stock, if any, will
also be entitled to the consideration payable with respect to fractional
shares that were to be issued in connection with a stock split the Company
effected in 2010. For the purposes of completing this Letter of Transmittal,
you should treat all of your certificates representing your shares of Nexsan
stock prior to the stock split as representing shares of Nexsan stock.

 

This Letter of Transmittal must accompany your certificate(s) formerly
representing shares of Nexsan stock (" _Nexsan Securities_ ") in order to
exchange, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, those
Nexsan Securities for cash and Imation common stock in connection with the
Merger. See instructions below. You must fill out and deliver this Letter of
Transmittal even if you have never had certificate(s) or other documentation
for your Nexsan Securities.

_NOTICE_ : BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL TO THE
DISBURSING AGENT, THE UNDERSIGNED IS MAKING ALL OF THE REPRESENTATIONS,

6 _INSTRUCTIONS_

 

 _1\. Delivery of Letter of Transmittal and Certificate(s)._

This Letter of Transmittal filled in and signed, must be used in connection
with the delivery and surrender of the Certificate(s). A Letter of Transmittal
and the Certificate(s) must be received by the Paying Agent, in satisfactory
form, in order to make an effective surrender. Delivery of the Certificate(s)
and other documents shall be effected, and the risk of loss and title to the
Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificate(s) to
the Paying Agent. The method of delivery of the Certificate(s) and other
documents is at the election and risk of the stockholder. If such delivery is
by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested, properly insured,
is recommended. Surrender may be made by mail, by hand or by overnight
courier to U. S. Bank National Association, as Paying Agent, at one of the
addresses shown above. Upon surrender of the Certificate(s), any Shares issued
subsequent to such surrender and prior to the closing of the Merger shall be
deemed to be surrendered for payment.

_2\. Terms of Conversion of the Shares._

Each Share (as shown in the box on the first page of this Letter of
Transmittal) will be converted at the effective time of the Merger into the
right to receive cash in an amount equal to $ per Share, without
interest, and subject to applicable withholding, as set forth in the Merger
Agreement.

 

 _3\. Guarantee of Signature._

The Certificate(s) need not be endorsed and stock powers and signature
guarantees are unnecessary unless (a) the Certificate(s) is(are) registered in
a name other than that of the person surrendering the Certificate(s) or (b)
such registered holder completes the Special Payment/Delivery Instructions or
requests payment to a name other than the registered holder. In the case of
(a) above, any such Certificate(s) must be duly endorsed or accompanied by a
properly executed stock power with the signature on the endorsement or stock
power and on the Letter of Transmittal guaranteed by a participant in the
Security Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the New York Stock Exchange
Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock Exchange Medallion Program
(each, an " _Eligible Institution_ "). In the case of (b) above, only the
signature on the Letter of Transmittal should be similarly guaranteed.

 

 _4\. Signatures on Letter of Transmittal and Endorsements._

If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Shares surrendered hereby, the signature(s) must correspond with the name(s)
as written on the face of the Certificate(s) without alteration, enlargement
or any change whatsoever. If any of the Shares surrendered hereby are
registered in different names on several Certificates, it will be necessary to
complete, sign and submit as many separate Letters of Transmittal as
there are different registrations of Certificates.

If any of the Shares surrendered hereby are held of record by two or more
joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal. If this
Letter of Transmittal or any Share certificate or stock power is signed by a
trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact, officer of a
corporation or other person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity,
such person should so indicate when signing, and proper evidence satisfactory
to the Company of the authority of such person so to act must be submitted.

 

If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by the registered holder(s) of the
Shares listed and surrendered hereby, no endorsements of Certificates or
separate stock powers are required unless payment is to be issued in the name
of a person other than the registered holder(s). Signatures on any such
Certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution. 

If this Letter of Transmittal is signed by a person other than the registered
holder(s) of the Shares evidenced by Certificates listed and surrendered
hereby, the Certificates must be endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock
powers, in either case signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered
holder(s) appear(s) on the Certificates. Signature(s) on any such
Certificates or stock powers must be guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

If this Letter of Transmittal or any Certificate(s) or stock power(s) is
signed by a trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, attorney-in-fact,
officer of a corporation or others acting in a fiduciary or representative
capacity, such persons should so indicate when signing, and submit evidence
attesting to his or her authority.

_5\. Stock Transfer Taxes._

 

The Company will bear liability for any state stock transfer taxes applicable
to the delivery of checks in payment for surrendered Shares; provided,
however, that if any such check is to be issued to any person(s) other than
the registered holder(s) of the surrendered Shares, it shall be a condition of
the issuance and delivery of such check that the amount of any stock transfer
taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder(s) or such person(s)) payable
on account of the transfer (or transfers) of the surrendered Shares shall be
delivered to the Paying Agent or satisfactory evidence of the payment of such
taxes or nonapplicability thereof shall be submitted to the Paying Agent
before such check will be issued.

_6\. Validity of Surrender, Irregularities._

All questions as to validity, form and eligibility of any surrender of Shares
hereby will be determined by the Company (which may delegate power in whole

corporation (" _Buyer_ "), Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a
Colorado limited liability company, acting solely in its capacity as the
appointed and authorized representative of the Selling Parties (the " _Selling
Parties  Representative_"), and U.S. Bank National Association, a national
banking association (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). Buyer, Selling Parties
Representative and the Escrow Agent are referred to collectively as the "
_Parties_ " or individually as a " _Party_." Each capitalized term used
herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to such term
in the Merger Agreement (as hereinafter defined).

_RECITALS_

A. Buyer, Naboo Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-
owned subsidiary of Buyer (" _Buyer Subsidiary_ "), the Selling Parties
Representative and Nexsan Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
") are parties to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
December 31, 2012 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), which contemplates a merger
pursuant to which Buyer Subsidiary will be merged with and into Company, with
the Company remaining as the Surviving Corporation and will result in Buyer
becoming the sole stockholder of the Surviving Corporation.

B. _Section 8.10_ of the Merger Agreement contemplates that at the Closing,

representing a value, as measured at the Buyer Stock Reference Price
of $5,975,000 (less the value of any Fractional Share Amount as stated
therein) registered in the name of the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Stock_ ")
which will be held in a separate segregated subaccount by the Escrow Agent
(the " _General Subaccount_ ") pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
the Merger Agreement. _Section 1.5(g)_ and _(h_ ) of the Merger Agreement may

Agreement. [**]

AGREEMENT

In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth in this Agreement and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which are hereby
acknowledged, each Party hereby agrees as follows:

1\. _Appointment of Escrow Agent and Escrow Account_. Buyer and the Selling
Parties Representative hereby appoint the Escrow Agent to serve as escrow
agent for the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms hereof. On or before the
first Business Day following the date hereof, Buyer shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent the Cash Escrow Amount, in cash by wire transfer of immediately
available funds pursuant to wire transfer instructions provided by the Escrow
Agent and the Escrow Stock by delivery of stock certificates of Buyer Stock
issued in the name of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent hereby accepts
appointment as escrow agent and agrees to hold and disburse the undisbursed
balance of the Escrow Holdings, which Escrow Holdings shall include any
interest income and other amounts received thereon (the " _Escrow Earnings_
"), in accordance with the terms hereof. The Escrow Agent will hold
the Escrow Holdings in the applicable segregated Escrow Subaccounts. Escrow
Holdings cannot be transferred between Escrow Subaccounts without a joint
written instruction signed by the Selling Parties Representative and Buyer (a
" _Joint Instruction_ ") and, except as otherwise explicitly provided in the
Merger Agreement, cannot be used to satisfy claims associated with a different
Escrow Subaccount. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Business Day_ " means
any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday and other than a day that banks in
the State of Minnesota are generally authorized or required by Applicable Law
to be closed. Any action that is required to be taken which falls on a day
that is not a Business Day shall be taken on the next occurring Business Day.

2\. _Escrow Investments_. Until all cash in the Escrow Subaccounts has been
fully disbursed, the Escrow Agent shall invest the Cash Escrow Amount (plus
any Escrow Earnings received as cash), in the U.S. Bank Money Market Deposit
Account set forth on the attached _Schedule A_. If, for some reason, both
the Selling Parties Representative and Buyer agree to invest the Cash Escrow
Amount (plus any Escrow Earnings received as cash) in a different investment
vehicle, the Selling Parties Representative and Buyer will issue a Joint
Instruction to the Escrow Agent selecting a different investment vehicle for
the Cash Escrow Amount (plus any Escrow Earnings received as cash). All
investments shall be made in the name of Escrow Agent. All investment
earnings (" _Escrow Earnings_ ") shall become part of the Escrow Holdings and
investment losses shall be charged against the Escrow Holdings; provided
however, that Escrow Earnings and investment losses shall only accrue for the
benefit or detriment of the Escrow Subaccount to which they relate.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will
the interest or other income earned or received with respect to the cash
amounts deposited into an Escrow Subaccount exceed in the aggregate 18% of
the initial deposit in such



 



   ** | Denotes confidential information that has been omitted from the
exhibit and filed separately, accompanied by a confidential treatment request,
with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
---|--- 
 



2  Escrow Subaccount, and any amounts of interest or other income earned or
received with respect to the cash amounts deposited into an Escrow Subaccount
in excess thereof will be paid to Buyer;  _provided_ , _however_ , that for
the avoidance of doubt, such limitation shall not apply to the Escrow Stock or
any interest or other income earned or received with respect to the Escrow
Stock (or proceeds therefrom). The preceding sentence is intended to ensure
that the right of the Escrow Recipients to the Cash Escrow Amount and any
interest and earnings earned thereon is not treated as a contingent payment
without a stated maximum selling price under Section 453 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable or responsible for loss in
the value of any investment made pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, or for any
loss, cost or penalty resulting from any sale or liquidation of investments
of the Cash Escrow Amount (plus any Escrow Earnings received as cash), except,
in either case, in the event of bad faith or gross negligence of the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent is authorized to liquidate, in accordance with its
customary procedures, any portion of the Cash Escrow Amount (plus any Escrow
Earnings received as cash) consisting of investments to provide for payments
hereunder. The Escrow Stock shall be held as Buyer Stock and shall not be
liquidated or otherwise reinvested. The Escrow Agent shall not use the Escrow
Stock to cover any losses on any investments of Escrow Holdings. Any amounts
received by the Escrow Agent on account of holding Escrow Stock shall be held
in the form received, except that cash received on account of such stock shall
be invested as all other cash held in the Escrow Account. Until such time as
the Escrow Stock is delivered to the Escrow Recipients (or returned to
or repurchased by Buyer), the Escrow Recipients shall be deemed to be the
beneficial owner of their Pro-Rata Percentage of the Buyer Stock that is held
pursuant to this Agreement and shall possess, through the Selling Parties
Representative, all rights with respect to such shares, except the right of
possession thereof. In particular, the respective Escrow Recipients, through
the Selling Parties Representative as their agent and attorney-in-fact, shall
have the right to exercise any voting rights with respect to their allocable
portion of the Buyer Stock that is held pursuant to this Agreement. Each
Escrow Recipient shall direct the Selling Parties Representative in writing
as to the exercise of any voting rights by such Escrow Recipient, and the
Selling Parties Representative and Escrow Agent shall comply with any such
directions of such Escrow Recipient. In the absence of such directions by an
Escrow Recipient with respect to its Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Stock,
neither Buyer, Escrow Agent nor the Selling Parties Representative shall vote
any of the Escrow Stock attributable to such Escrow Recipient. In addition,
any dividends (other than non-taxable stock dividends) made with respect to
the Buyer Stock that is held pursuant to this Agreement shall be promptly paid
to the Disbursing Agent for payment to the Escrow Recipients in accordance
with their allocable portion of the Buyer Stock. The Buyer Stock shall be
registered in the name of the Escrow Agent on behalf of the Escrow Recipients,
and the Escrow Recipients shall be treated as the beneficial owners of their
allocable portion of the Escrow Stock for tax purposes.

 

3\. _Escrow Earnings_.

(a) Ownership of Escrow Earnings. The Parties agree that the Escrow Recipients
shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Earnings with respect to the
Selling Parties Representative Subaccount and the Buyer Stock for all tax
purposes and that the Escrow Recipients shall include in their gross income
any Escrow Earnings for each taxable year of such Escrow Recipient that has
accrued during such taxable year with respect to the Selling Parties
Representative Subaccount and the Buyer Stock, without regard to whether such
Escrow

 



3  Earnings are ever paid to such Escrow Recipients. The Parties agree that
Buyer shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow Earnings for all tax
purposes with respect to the other Escrow Subaccounts and that Buyer shall
include in its gross income any Escrow Earnings for each taxable year of Buyer
that has accrued during such taxable year with respect to the other Escrow
Subaccounts, and Buyer will be entitled to an interest deduction in an amount
provided by Sections 1.1275-4(c) or 1.483-4 of the Treasury Regulations upon
distribution of such Escrow Subaccounts to the Escrow Recipients. Subject to
the following sentence, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Disbursing Agent
(for distribution to the Escrow Recipients in accordance with their Pro-Rata
Percentages) all non-cash dividends on Escrow Stock earned during any calendar
quarter on or before the 15th of the month following such calendar quarter, or
upon termination of the Escrow Account in the final year of the Escrow
Account, less any amount the Escrow Agent may be required by the Internal
Revenue Code to withhold for payment of taxes. For Escrow Stock that is
attributable to Non-Accredited Selling Parties, the Escrow Agent shall retain
as additions to Escrow Stock all non-cash dividends on Escrow Stock earned
during any calendar quarter and only release such additional shares of Escrow
Stock to Buyer upon termination of the Escrow Account in the final year of
the Escrow Account in accordance with the procedures in of _Section 1.5(g)_
of the Merger Agreement, and following the conclusion of such procedures, the
Escrow Agent shall pay to the Disbursing Agent (for distribution to
the Escrow Recipients who are Non-Accredited Selling Parties in accordance
with their Pro-Rata Percentages) less any amount the Escrow Agent may be
required by the Internal Revenue Code to withhold for payment of taxes. The
Selling Parties Representative and Buyer shall promptly deliver such
certificates and other documents in its possession as the Escrow Agent may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing, including, without
limitation, a completed, executed Form W-9 (or Form W-8BEN, in the case of
non-U.S. persons).

(b) Disbursement of Escrow Earnings. All Escrow Earnings not distributed
pursuant to _Section 3(a)_ hereof shall be distributed at the times, and in
the proportions, that the Escrow Holdings are distributed.

4\. _General Subaccount Claims and Notices of Retention Amounts_.

(a) Notice of a Claim. From time to time, Buyer may give written notice (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") to the Selling Parties Representative (with a copy to the
Escrow Agent) of any claim for indemnification that Buyer may have based on
Buyers reasonable judgment pursuant to _Section 8.5_ of the Merger Agreement
(a " _Claim_ "). Such Claim Notice shall specifically identify this Agreement
and specify in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claims for
indemnification under the Merger Agreement, the amount of the Claim or the
method of computation of the amount of such Claim, a reference to the
applicable provision(s) in the Merger Agreement or other document delivered
pursuant thereto upon which the Claim is based and identify the Escrow
Subaccount from which such Claim shall be satisfied. Additionally, the Claim
Notice shall identify the type (cash and/or Buyer Stock) and amounts (dollar
amounts and/or number of share of Buyer Stock) of Escrow Holdings that Buyer
claims to be entitled to receive (the " _Cash/Stock Proposal_ "). If the
dollar amount of such Claim cannot be accurately determined, the Claim Notice
shall include Buyers good-faith estimate (which shall be subject to the
Selling Parties Representatives approval, which will not be unreasonably
withheld nor construed as any admission on the Selling Parties part), which
shall serve as the dollar amount in question hereunder until such dollar
amount can be more accurately determined. The Escrow Agent shall not inquire
into or consider whether a Claim complies with the requirements of the Merger
Agreement.

 



4 (b) Response from the Selling Parties Representative. The Selling
Parties Representative has thirty (30) days following its receipt of a Claim
Notice to either (i) agree to the amount or method of determination set forth
in the Claim Notice and the Cash/Stock Proposal and to instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay such amount and/or deliver such Buyer Stock, as provide in the
Claim Notice, to Buyer in immediately available funds and/or immediate deliver
to Buyer such amount of Buyer Stock from the General Subaccount, or (ii)
provide Buyer and the Escrow Agent with notice that the Selling Parties
Representative disagrees with the amount or method of determination set forth
in the Claim Notice or any other aspect of the Claim Notice including, but not
limited to, the Claim in its entirety (the " _Dispute Notice_ "). Failure by
the Selling Parties Representative to provide Buyer and the Escrow Agent with
a Dispute Notice within such time period shall be deemed an acceptance of such
Claim and Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to treat such Claim as
if a Joint Instruction had been received with respect to the payment of such
Claim.

 

(c) Claim Resolution. For any Claim for which the Selling Parties
Representative delivers a Dispute Notice, the Escrow Agent shall make payment
with respect thereto only in accordance with (i) any Joint Instruction or (ii)
_Section 4(d)_ hereof. If Buyer and the Selling Parties Representative
resolve such Claim, Buyer and the Selling Parties Representative shall
promptly deliver a Joint Instruction to the Escrow Agent as to the disposition
of such Claim, and the Escrow Agent shall promptly act in accordance
therewith.

 

(d) Court Orders and Other Circumstances.

(i) In addition to any disbursements otherwise provided for in this _Section
4_, the Escrow Agent shall also make disbursements from General Subaccount to
Buyer or the Selling Parties Representative upon receipt of any court order
or arbitral decision that is accompanied by a written legal opinion by counsel
to the Party purportedly eligible to receive such disbursement to the effect
that the court order or arbitral decision is final and non-appealable and
determining that the amount stated therein is owed to Buyer or the Selling
Parties Representative (as applicable) pursuant to the Merger Agreement and
this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall act on such court order or arbitral
decision and legal opinion without further inquiry, regardless of whether the
Escrow Agent has received a Joint Instruction from Buyer and the Selling
Parties Representative with respect thereto.

 

(ii) Subject to _Section 4(d)(i)_ hereof, if the Escrow Agent is at any time
uncertain as to what action it should take hereunder, then the Escrow Agent
shall notify Buyer and the Selling Parties Representative thereof and may in
its sole discretion, take either or both of the following actions:

 

(x) suspend the performance of any of its obligations (including without
limitation any disbursement obligations) under this Agreement until such
uncertainty is resolved via a Joint Instruction or until a successor Escrow
Agent shall have been appointed (as the case may be).

 



5 (y) petition (by means of an interpleader action or any other
appropriate method) any court of competent jurisdiction in any venue
convenient to the Escrow Agent, for instructions with respect to such dispute
or uncertainty, and to the extent required or permitted by law, pay into such
court, for holding and disposition in accordance with the instructions of
such court, all Escrow Holdings, after deduction and payment to the Escrow
Agent of all fees and expenses (including court costs and attorneys fees)
payable to, incurred by, or expected to be incurred by the Escrow Agent in
connection with the performance of its duties and the exercise of its rights
hereunder (such deductions to be made first from cash in the General
Subaccount, second from cash in the Selling Parties
Representative Subaccount, third from cash in the Reconciliation Subaccount
and fourth from Buyer Stock in the General Subaccount).

The Escrow Agent shall have no liability to Buyer, the Selling Parties
Representative, the Selling Parties, any of their respective owners,
shareholders or members, or any other Person with respect to any such
suspension of performance or disbursement into court, specifically including
any liability or claimed liability that may arise, or be alleged to have
arisen, out of or as a result of any delay in the disbursement of the Escrow
Holdings or any delay in or with respect to any other action required
or requested of Escrow Agent.

(e) Distributions of Buyer Stock. Anytime Buyer Stock is to be distributed by
the Escrow Agent from the General Subaccount to Buyer, the Escrow Agent will
take such reasonable actions as Buyer may request to transfer beneficial
ownership of such Buyer Stock to Buyer, including instructions to have the
Escrow Agent provide the certificates of Buyer Stock directly to Buyers
transfer agent responsible for administration and issuance of Buyer Stock
share certificates (the " _Transfer Agent_ ") with direction to the Transfer
Agent to issue Buyer Stock share certificates in the name of Buyer and to
deliver such certificates to Buyer or to retire and cancel such certificates
as Buyer may instruct.

5\. _Disbursements from the General Subaccount to the Disbursing Agent_.

(a) Release Dates from General Subaccount. Except for any Pending Claim
Amounts as provided in _Section 5(b)_ hereof, on the eighteen month
anniversary of the Effective Date (the " _Initial Release Date_ "), the
Escrow Agent shall disburse to the Disbursing Agent the remainder of the
Escrow Holdings contained within the General Subaccount minus (i) any Pending
Claim Amounts as provided in  _Section 5(b)_ hereof and (ii) any Escrow
Earnings on that portion of the Escrow Amount, which will not be released
pursuant to this _Section 5(a)(i)_, but are addressed in _Section 3(b)_ of
this Agreement. 

(b) Pending Claims. If there are outstanding Claims on the Initial Release
Date, then an amount adequate to cover such pending Claims (a " _Pending
Claim Amount_ ") shall be withheld by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow
Holdings of the General Subaccount for as long as required to finally resolve
such pending Claims. Any Pending Claim Amounts shall be determined in the
reasonable judgment of Buyer, subject to objection by the Selling Parties
Representative and any resolution of the related Claim as provided in the
Merger Agreement.

 

(c) Disbursement upon Resolution of Pending Claims. Within two Business Days
following the resolution of each pending Claim (if any), the Escrow Agent
shall

 



6  disburse to the Disbursing Agent the Escrow Holdings being held by the
Escrow Agent relating to such pending Claim, to the extent that it is not
awarded to Buyer pursuant to the terms hereof or subject to another pending
Claim.

(d) Joint Written Instructions. Any disbursement to the Disbursing Agent by
the Escrow Agent pursuant to this _Section 5_ shall be made within two
Business Days following the Escrow Agents receipt of a Joint Instruction,
setting forth the portion of the Escrow Holdings to be released and the
Disbursing Agents wire transfer information.

(e) Distributions of Buyer Stock. Anytime Buyer Stock is to be distributed
by the Escrow Agent from the General Subaccount to the Disbursing Agent, the
Escrow Agent will take such reasonable actions as the Selling Parties
Representative / Disbursing Agent may request to transfer ownership of such
Buyer Stock to the Escrow Recipients, including instructions to have the
Escrow Agent provide the certificates of Buyer Stock directly to the Transfer
Agent with direction to the Transfer Agent to issue Buyer Stock share
certificates in the name of the appropriate Escrow Recipient and to deliver
such certificates to the Disbursing Agent for further distribution to the
Escrow Recipients. In connection with the preceding sentence, Buyer will take
such commercially reasonable actions to effectuate the intent and purposes of
this Agreement and the foregoing provisions, as may be required or requested
by the Transfer Agent.

6.  _Selling Parties  Representatives Subaccount Claims, Notices and
Disbursements_.

(a) Notice of Claims. The Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow Holdings of
the Selling Parties Representative Subaccount, or any portion thereof, in
accordance with written instructions (a " _Selling Parties  Representative
Claim Notice_") delivered by the Selling Parties Representative to the
Escrow Agent. The Selling Parties Representative Claim Notice shall attach an
itemized invoice of the amounts actually incurred by the Selling Parties
Representative to fund its activities under the Merger Agreement and this
Agreement. Additionally, the Selling Parties Representative Claim Notice
shall set forth detailed payment instructions for each amount requested to be
distributed from the Selling Parties Representative Subaccount. Upon receipt
of a Selling Parties Representative Claim Notice executed by the Selling
Parties Representative, the Escrow Agent shall pay, within three days after
receipt by the Escrow Agent of such Selling Parties Representative Claim
Notice, the requested amounts from the Selling Parties Representative
Subaccount in immediately available funds according to the disbursement
instructions given in the Selling Parties Representative Claim Notice. Upon
release of all amounts in each of the Escrow Subaccounts (other than the
Selling Parties Representative Subaccount), the amounts remaining, if any, in
the Selling Parties Representative Subaccount shall be paid to the
Disbursing Agent by the Escrow Agent for further distribution to the Selling
Parties within ten Business Days of the date such release is requested by the
Selling Parties Representative.

 

7\. _*[Intentionally Omitted]*_.

8\. _Reconciliation Subaccount Disbursements_.

 



7 (a) Disbursement. Escrow Agent shall make payment from the Reconciliation
Subaccount only in accordance with (i) any Joint Instruction or (ii)
_Section 8(b)_ hereof.

8_, the Escrow Agent shall also make disbursements from the Reconciliation
Subaccount to Buyer or the Disbursing Agent (for further distribution to the
Selling Parties) upon receipt of any court order or arbitral decision that is
accompanied by a written legal opinion by counsel to the Party purportedly
eligible to receive such disbursement to the effect that the court order or
arbitral decision is final and non-appealable and determining that the amount
stated therein is owed to Buyer or the Selling Parties (as applicable)
pursuant to the Merger Agreement and this Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall
act on such court order or arbitral decision and legal opinion without further
inquiry, regardless of whether the Escrow Agent has received a Joint
Instruction from Buyer and the Selling Parties Representative with respect
thereto.

(ii) Subject to  _Section 8(b)(i)_ hereof, if the Escrow Agent is at any
time uncertain as to what action it should take hereunder, then the Escrow
Agent shall notify Buyer and the Selling Parties Representative thereof and
may in its sole discretion, take either or both of the following actions:

limitation any disbursement obligations) under this Agreement until such
uncertainty is resolved via a Joint Instruction or until a successor Escrow
Agent shall have been appointed (as the case may be).

method) any court of competent jurisdiction in any venue convenient to the
Escrow Agent, for instructions with respect to such dispute or uncertainty,
and to the extent required or permitted by law, pay into such court, for

all Escrow Holdings, after deduction and payment to the Escrow Agent of all
fees and expenses (including court costs and attorneys fees) payable to,

Holdings or any delay in or with respect to any other action required or
requested of Escrow Agent.

 



8 9\. _Certain Terms Concerning Escrow Stock_.

delivered to the Escrow Recipients (or returned to Buyer), the Selling
Parties Representative shall have the right to exercise any voting rights on
behalf of the Escrow Recipients with respect to the Escrow Stock attributable
to each such Escrow Recipient as provided above in  _Section 2_. The Escrow
Agent shall comply with any such directions of the Selling Parties
Representative. In the absence of such directions by the Selling Parties
Representative with respect to the Escrow Stock, the Escrow Agent shall not
vote any of the Escrow Stock attributable to such Escrow Recipient. Neither
the Escrow Agent nor its nominee shall be under any duty to take any action

10\. _Termination_.

Holdings remaining.

 

11\. _Duties and Powers of the Escrow Agent_.

(a) Certain Duties and Powers. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,

any greater degree of care than it gives its own similar property and shall
not be required to invest any funds held hereunder except as directed herein,
(ii) may act in reliance upon any instrument or signature reasonably believed
by it to be genuine and may reasonably assume that the person purporting to
make any statement or execute any document in connection with the provisions
hereof has been duly authorized to do so, and (iii) may conclusively presume
that (A) the representative of Buyer executing this Agreement has full power
and authority to instruct the Escrow Agent on behalf of Buyer, or appoint
representatives of Buyer designated on _Schedule C_ hereto to instruct the
Escrow Agent on behalf of Buyer, unless written notice to the contrary is
delivered to the Escrow Agent by Buyer, and (B) the representative of the
Selling Parties Representative executing this Agreement has full power and
authority to instruct the Escrow Agent on behalf of the Selling
Parties Representative, or appoint representatives of Selling Parties
Representative designated on _Schedule C_ hereto to instruct the Escrow Agent
on behalf

 



9  of the Selling Parties Representative, unless written notice to the
contrary is delivered to the Escrow Agent by the Selling Parties
Representative. The applicable persons designated on _Schedule C_ hereto have
full power and authority to execute and deliver any Joint Instruction, to
amend, modify or waive any provision of this Escrow Agreement and to take any
and all other actions as the representatives of Buyer and the Selling
Parties Representative respectively under this Agreement, all without further
consent or direction from, or notice to, it or any other party.

(b) No Interest in Escrow Holdings. The Escrow Agent does not have any
interest in the Escrow Holdings deposited hereunder, but is serving as escrow
holder only with possession thereof. Any payments of income from the Escrow
Account shall be subject to withholding regulations then in force with respect
to all applicable taxes.

11\. _Limited Liability_.

(a) Limited Liability. In performing its duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent
shall not incur any liability for any damages, losses or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), except for liability due to willful
misconduct or gross negligence by the Escrow Agent or any of its agents. The
duties and obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be determined solely by the
provisions hereof and, accordingly, the Escrow Agent shall not be responsible
except for the performance of such duties and obligations as it
has undertaken herein. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability under and no
duty to inquire as to the provisions of any agreement other than this
Agreement, including without limitation any other agreement between Buyer or
the Selling Parties Representative or any other persons even though
reference thereto may be made herein. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be
liable for incidental, indirect, special, consequential or punitive damages
(including, but not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has
been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the
form of action. The Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal
action or commence any proceeding in connection with the Escrow Holdings, any
account in which Escrow Holdings are deposited, this Escrow Agreement, or the
Merger Agreement, or to appear in, prosecute or defend any such legal action
or proceeding. The Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel selected by it in
the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the
provisions hereof or of any other agreement or of its duties hereunder, or
relating to any dispute involving any party hereto, and shall incur no
liability and shall be fully indemnified from any liability whatsoever in
acting in accordance with the opinion or instruction of such counsel. The
Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or for any act
done or step taken or omitted by it in good faith, or for any mistake of fact
or law, or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection
with this Agreement, except for its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to comply
with final orders issued or process entered by any court with respect to the
Escrow Holdings, without determination by the Escrow Agent of such courts
jurisdiction in the matter. If any portion of the Escrow Holdings is at any
time attached, garnished or levied upon under any court order, or in case the
payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property
shall be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment
or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property or
any part thereof, then and in any such event, the Escrow Agent is authorized,
in its sole discretion, to rely upon and comply with any such order, writ,
judgment or decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected by it is
binding upon it without the need for appeal or other action; and if the Escrow
Agent complies with any such order, writ, judgment or

 



10  decree, it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other
person or entity by reason of such compliance even though such order, writ,
judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set
aside or vacated.

(b) Third Party Advisors. The Escrow Agent may employ or retain such other
experts, advisors, agents or agencies as it may in its reasonable discretion
require for the purpose of discharging its duties under this Agreement, and
the Escrow Agent shall be fully protected in acting or not acting in good
faith on the opinion or advice or on information obtained from any such
parties and shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligent actions
on the part of any of them. The reasonable costs of such services shall be
added to and be part of the Escrow Agents fees under this Agreement.

(c) Escrow Agent Funds. No provision of this Agreement shall require
the Escrow Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial
liability in the performance of its duties or in the exercise of any of its
rights or powers unless indemnified as provided for herein, other than a
result of its own gross negligence or bad faith.

(d) Escrow Amount. The Escrow Agent does not have any interest in the Escrow
Amount but is serving as escrow agent only and is not a debtor of the parties
hereto in respect of the Escrow Amount.

(e) Duties of Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall have no duties except
those which are expressly set forth herein, and it shall not be bound by any
notice of a claim or demand with respect to, or any waiver, modification,
amendment, termination or rescission of this Agreement, unless received by it
in writing, and signed by the parties hereto and if its duties herein are
affected, unless it shall have given its prior written consent thereto. The
Escrow Agent accepts the duties and responsibilities under this Agreement as
agent, and no trust is intended to be, or is or will be, created hereby and
the Escrow Agent shall owe no duties hereunder as trustee. The Escrow Agent
will have no responsibility for seeking, obtaining, compiling, preparing or
determining the accuracy of any information or document, including the
representative capacity in which a party purports to act, that the Escrow
Agent receives as a condition to a release from Escrow Amounts under
this Agreement.

12\. _Indemnity_. Buyer and the Selling Parties Representative (solely on
behalf of the Selling Parties and in its capacity as the Selling Parties
Representative, not in its individual capacity) will, severally and not
jointly (one-half to be borne by Buyer and one-half to be borne by the Selling
Parties), indemnify the Escrow Agent against, and hold the Escrow Agent and
its directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") harmless from, any and all claims, actions, demands,
losses, damages, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
and liabilities that may be imposed upon the Escrow Agent in the performance
of its duties hereunder as the escrow agent, including any litigation arising
from this Agreement or involving the subject matter hereof, but excluding any
such claims, actions, demands, losses, damages, expenses and liabilities
resulting from or arising out of fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence
by the Escrow Agent and its directors, officers, employees and agents.
The foregoing indemnification to hold harmless shall survive the resignation
or removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement.

 



11 13\. _Resignation and Removal of the Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent (and
any successor escrow agent) may at any time (a) resign by giving written
notice thereof to Buyer and the Selling Parties Representative or (b) be
removed by mutual written notice thereof to the Escrow Agent from Buyer and
the Selling Parties Representative, in each case with such notice being
given at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such resignation or
removal (as applicable). The resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent (i)
shall not affect any right or remedy any Party may have and (ii) shall not be
effective until delivery of the Escrow Account to any successor escrow agent
jointly designated by Buyer and the Selling Parties Representative in writing
or to any court of competent jurisdiction. If the Escrow Agent has not
received a designation of a successor escrow agent within 30 days following
such notice of resignation or removal (as applicable), then the Escrow Agents
sole responsibility after that time shall be to retain and safeguard the
Escrow Account until receipt of (A) a joint designation of a successor escrow
agent, (B) a Joint Instruction relating to disposition or (C) a final non-
appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. After any retiring
Escrow Agents resignation, the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Escrow Agent under this Agreement.

 

14\. _Succession_. Any corporation into or with which the Escrow Agent may be
merged or consolidated or amalgamated, or any corporation resulting therefrom
to which the Escrow Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to
all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Escrow Agent
shall be the successor to the Escrow Agent hereunder without any further act
on its part or any of the parties hereto.

15\. _Force Majeure_. No Party shall be liable to any other Party, or held in
breach of this Agreement, if prevented, hindered, or delayed in the
performance or observance of any provision contained herein by reason of act
of God, riots, terrorism, acts of war, epidemics, governmental action
or judicial order, earthquakes, or any other similar causes (including, but
not limited to, mechanical, electronic or communication interruptions,
disruptions or failures). Performance times under this Agreement shall be
extended for a period of time equivalent to the time lost because of any
delay that is excusable under this Section.

16\. _Notices_. All notices or other communications required or permitted to
be given hereunder will be in writing and will be (a) delivered by hand, (b)

and charges for performing its duties hereunder are set forth on _Schedule

money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions
to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who
opens an account. For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a
charity, a trust, or other legal entity, the Escrow Agent requires
documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal entity. The
Escrow Agent may ask to see financial statements, licenses, identification and
authorization documents from individuals claiming authority to represent the
entity or other relevant documentation. Buyer and the Selling Parties
Representative acknowledge that a portion of the identifying information set
forth herein is being requested by the Escrow Agent in connection with the
USA Patriot Act, Pub.L.107-56 (the " _Act_ "), and Buyer and the Selling
Parties Representative agree to provide any additional information requested
by the Escrow Agent in connection with the Act or any similar legislation or
regulation to which Escrow Agent is subject, in a timely manner.

19\. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which may be deemed an original but together shall constitute but one and the
same instrument. Such counterparts may be executed and delivered by facsimile
or other electronic means by any of the Parties, and the receiving Party may
rely on the receipt of such document so executed and delivered as if the
original had been received.

(b) Enforceability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, then each remaining provision
of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain in full force and effect, and such
unenforceable provision shall be interpreted and enforced in a manner as close
to its original intent as is permissible.

(c) Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement, including the Schedules
hereto (and, with respect to agreements between the Selling Parties
Representative and Buyer, the Merger Agreement), embodies the entire agreement
and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter
contained herein and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings among
the parties with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement may not be
amended or modified except by a writing signed by each Party hereto.

 



14 (d) Certain Interpretations. The headings contained in this Agreement are
for convenience only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation
of this Agreement. Each reference herein to "include" or "including" or
"includes" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

(e) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State
of Delaware without giving effect to conflict or choice of laws principles
that may be applicable.

(f) Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any right or obligation hereunder
will be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred (by operation of law or
otherwise) by any Party without the prior written consent of each other Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), except that each Party
will have the right to assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any
right hereunder or delegate any obligation hereunder to (a) a Person that does
all of the following: (1) acquires or otherwise succeeds to all or
substantially all of such Partys business and assets; (2) assumes all of such
Partys obligations hereunder or such Partys obligations hereunder that arise
after such assignment, delegation or transfer; and (3) agrees to perform or
cause performance of all such assumed obligations when due; or (b) any of its
affiliates; provided that no such assignment, delegation or transfer under
clause (a) or (b) above will relieve the assigning, delegating
or transferring Party of any obligation hereunder. This Agreement and all of
the provisions hereof will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment, delegation or other transfer not permitted by this Section is
void.

(g) Waiver. No delay or omission by any Party to exercise any right or power
it has under this Agreement shall impair or be construed as a waiver of such
right or power. A waiver by any Party of any breach, right or obligation shall
not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach, right or
obligation or any other breach, right or obligation. Any waiver must be
signed by the Party waiving its right.

(h) Efforts Required. Each Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, such actions, to execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, such additional documents and
instruments and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under the provisions hereof and under applicable law to consummate
and make effective the matters contemplated herein.

(i) Security Advice Waiver. Buyer and the Selling Parties Representative
acknowledge that to the extent regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency
or other applicable regulatory entity grant them the right to receive
brokerage confirmations for certain security transactions as they occur, Buyer
and the Selling Parties Representative specifically waive receipt of such
confirmations to the extent permitted by law. The Escrow Agent will furnish
to Buyer and the Selling Parties Representative periodic cash transaction
statements that include detail for all investment transactions made by the
Escrow Agent.

 _U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION_

_MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT AUTHORIZATION FORM_

_DESCRIPTION AND TERMS _

The U.S. Bank Money Market account is a U.S. Bank National Association ("U.S.
Bank") interest-bearing money market deposit account designed to meet the
needs of U.S. Banks Corporate Trust Services Escrow Group and other Corporate
Trust customers of U.S. Bank. Selection of this investment includes
authorization to place funds on deposit and invest with U.S. Bank. 

U.S. Bank uses the daily balance method to calculate interest on this account
(actual/365 or 366). This method applies a daily periodic rate to the
principal balance in the account each day. Interest is accrued daily and
credited monthly to the account. Interest rates are determined at U.S. Banks
discretion, and may be tiered by customer deposit amount.

 

The owner of the account is U.S. Bank as Agent for its trust customers. U.S.
Banks trust department performs all account deposits and
withdrawals. Deposit accounts are FDIC Insured per depositor, as determined
under FDIC Regulations, up to applicable FDIC limits.

 

 _AUTOMATIC AUTHORIZATION_

In the absence of specific written direction to the contrary, U.S. Bank is
hereby directed to invest and reinvest proceeds and other available moneys in
the U.S. Bank Money Market Account. The U.S. Bank Money Market Account is a
permitted investment under the operative documents and this authorization is
the permanent direction for investment of the moneys until notified in writing
of alternate instructions. _Schedule B_

activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify
and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.

For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a Trust or
other legal entity we will ask for documentation to verify its formation and
existence as a legal entity. We may also ask to see financial statements,
