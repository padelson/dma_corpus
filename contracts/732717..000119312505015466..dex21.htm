ARTICLE IV



_Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

_Exchange of Certificates _



4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:



(a) _Merger Consideration_. (i) Each share of Common Stock, par value $1.00
per share, of the Company (a " _ _Share__ " and, collectively, the " _
_Shares__ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) Shares owned by Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary
(as defined in Section 5.1(a)) of Parent and (ii) any Shares owned by the
Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company except, in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii), for any such Shares held on behalf of third
parties (each, an " _ _Excluded Share__ " and collectively, " _ _Excluded
Shares__ ")) (each such Share not constituting an Excluded Share, an " _
_Outstanding Share__ " and, collectively, the " _ _Outstanding Shares__ ")
shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for, 0.77942 (the " _
_Exchange Ratio__ ") common shares (the " _ _Per Share Merger Consideration__
"), par value $1.00 per share, of Parent (" _ _Parent Common Stock__ "). At
the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _
_Certificate__ ") formerly representing any of the Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration and the right, if any, to receive pursuant to
Section 4.2(e) cash in lieu of fractional shares into which such Shares have
been converted pursuant to this Section 4.1(a) and any dividend or
distribution with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
4.2(c).



(ii) Each Substitute Preferred Share (as defined in Section 6.4(b)) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into,
and become exchangeable for, one Parent Preferred Share (as defined in Section
5.2(b)) having (A) a value substantially equivalent, in the judgment of
Parent, to such Substitute



 

-3- Preferred Share as of the Effective Time, (B) such other terms as are
necessary to ensure that such Parent Preferred Shares would not constitute
"non-qualified preferred stock" under Section 351(g) of the Code and (C) such
other terms, if any, as are reasonably necessary so that the terms of such
Parent Preferred Shares do not prevent the delivery of the tax opinions set
forth in Sections 7.2(f) and 7.3(c) (collectively, the " _ _New Parent
Preferred Shares__ "). At the Effective Time, all of the Substitute Preferred
Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each certificate formerly representing such shares
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive New Parent Preferred
Shares in accordance with the foregoing.



(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.



(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



4.2. _Exchange of Certificates for Shares_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent selected by Parent with
the Companys prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed (the " _ _Exchange Agent__ "), for the benefit of the holders
of Outstanding Shares, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be exchanged for Outstanding Shares in respect of the Per Share
Merger Consideration to be paid in the Merger and, after the Effective Time,
if applicable, any cash and dividends or other distributions with respect to
the Parent Common Stock to be paid or to be issued pursuant to Section 4.2(e)
or 4.2(c) in exchange for Outstanding Shares (such certificates for shares of
Parent Common Stock, together with the amount of any cash payable pursuant to
Section 4.2(e) in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or other
distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 4.2(c), being
hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Exchange Fund__ ").



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Appropriate transmittal materials, to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company, shall be provided as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time by the Exchange Agent to holders of
record of Outstanding Shares converted in the Merger, advising such holders
of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon the surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent in accordance
with the terms of such transmittal materials, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (1) a certificate
representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article IV, (2) a check in the
amount (after giving effect to any



 

-4- required tax withholdings) of (A) any cash payable pursuant to Section 4.2(e)
in lieu of fractional shares plus (B) any unpaid non-stock dividends and any
other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 4.2(c), and, in each case, the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares
of Parent Common Stock, together with a check for any cash to be paid upon
due surrender of the Certificate and any other dividends or distributions in
respect thereof, may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid or are not applicable. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common
Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of
such exchange that the Person (as defined below) requesting such
exchange shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock in a name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of Parent or the Exchange Agent that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable.



For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _Person__ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section
5.1(d)(i)) or other entity of any kind or nature.



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. (i) All shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common
Stock, the record date for which is after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in
respect of the Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate is surrendered for exchange
in accordance with this Article IV. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be issued and/or paid
to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time of such
surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date,
the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares
of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to surrender.



(ii) Holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be entitled to vote after
the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent stockholders the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificates, regardless of
whether such holders have exchanged their Certificates.



 

-5- (d) _Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the Outstanding Shares.



(e) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued and any
holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock
but for this Section 4.2(e) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in
lieu thereof, which payment shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent and
shall represent such holders proportionate interest in a share of Parent
Common Stock based on the average of the per share closing prices of Parent
Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the " _ _NYSE__
") composite transactions reporting system for the 20 trading days ending on
the fifth trading day prior to the Closing Date. 



(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any shares of Parent
Common Stock) that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for
180 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any
shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
Article IV shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of any cash or
any shares of Parent Common Stock and payment of any cash, dividends and other
distributions in respect thereof payable or deliverable pursuant to Section
4.1, Section 4.2(c) and Section 4.2(e) upon due surrender of their
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), in each case, without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable
to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws
(as defined in Section 5.1(i)(i)).



(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the cash or the shares of
Parent Common Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions in
respect thereof that would be payable or deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.



(h) _Uncertificated Shares_. In the case of any shares of Company Common Stock
that are not represented by certificates, the Exchange Agent shall issue at
the Effective Time Parent Common Stock to the holders of such shares without
any action by such holders, and the parties shall make appropriate
adjustments to this Section 4.2 to assure the equivalent treatment thereof.



 

-6- 4.3. _No Dissenters  Rights_. In accordance with Section 910 of the NYBCL, no
appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Shares in connection with
the Merger.



4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares, or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for shares of Parent Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted.



4.5. _Company Stock Based Plans_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _
_Company Option__ ") under the Companys stock-based benefit plans and under
individual employment agreements to which the Company is a party (the " _
_Company Stock Plans__ "), whether vested or unvested, shall be converted into
an option to acquire a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded up to the nearest whole number) of (x) the number of Shares
subject to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y)
the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded down to the
nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per Share of such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange
Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price and the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Options
shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
409A of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any Company
Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option
shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such
adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the
Effective Time, each Company Option shall continue to be governed by the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall adopt appropriate amendments to the Company Stock Plans, if applicable,
and the Board of Directors of the Company shall adopt appropriate
resolutions, if applicable, to effectuate the provisions of this Section
4.5(a). Parent shall take all actions as are necessary for the assumption of
the Company Stock Plans pursuant to this Section 4.5, including the
reservation, issuance (subject to Section 4.5(c)) and listing of Parent
Common Stock as necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Section 4.5.



 

-7- (b) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to
acquire or receive Shares or benefits measured by the value of Shares, and
each award of any kind consisting of Shares that may be held, awarded,
outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under the Company Stock Plans
and any other Compensation and Benefits Plans, other than Company Options
(the " _ _Company Awards__ "), shall be deemed to be converted into the right
to acquire or receive benefits measured by the value of (as the case may be)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (y) the Exchange Ratio, and each such right shall otherwise
be subject to the terms and conditions applicable to such right under
the relevant Company Stock Plan or other Compensation and Benefit Plan. At or
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt appropriate amendments to
the Company Stock Plans and such Compensation and Benefits Plans, if
applicable, and the Board of Directors of the Company shall adopt appropriate
resolutions, if applicable, to effectuate the provisions of this Section
4.5(b).



(c) If registration of any interests in the Company Stock Plans or other
Compensation and Benefit Plans or the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable thereunder is required under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the " _ _Securities Act__ "), Parent shall file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _ _SEC__ ") prior to the Effective Time
a registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8, as the case may be (or any
successor form), or another appropriate form with respect to such interests or
Parent Common Stock, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such
registration statement declared effective by the SEC as of the Effective Time
and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain
the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein and
comply with any applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws) for so long
as the relevant Company Stock Plans or other Compensation and Benefit Plans,
as applicable, remain in effect and such registration of interests therein or
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable thereunder (and compliance with
any such state laws) continues to be required. As soon as practicable after
the registration of such interests or shares, as applicable, Parent shall
deliver to the holders of Company Options and Company Awards appropriate
notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective Company
Stock Plans and agreements evidencing the grants of such Company Options and
Company Awards, and stating that such Company Options and Company Awards and
agreements have been assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section
4.5 after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the Company Stock
Plans). 



(d) Without limiting the applicability of the preceding paragraph, the
Company and Parent shall take all necessary action to ensure that the
Surviving Corporation will not be required to deliver Shares or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company
Options or Company Awards after the Effective Time. At or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall adopt appropriate amendments to all Company
Stock Plans conferring any rights to Shares or



 

-8- other capital stock of the Company, if applicable, and the Board of Directors
of the Company shall adopt appropriate resolutions, if applicable, to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 4.5(d).



(e) The Board of Directors of the Company (or a committee thereof to the
extent applicable) shall take all necessary actions to ensure that the terms
of the Company Options and Company Awards then outstanding under each Company
Stock Plan are equitably adjusted to take into account the payment of the
Special Dividend pursuant to Section 6.18 of this Agreement, and that any
applicable performance goals with respect to Company Options, Company Awards
and other Company compensation are, if impacted by the Special Dividend,
equitably adjusted.



ARTICLE V



_Representations and Warranties_



5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the disclosure letter (subject to Section 9.12(c) of this Agreement) delivered
to Parent by the Company prior to entering into this Agreement (the " _
_Company Disclosure Letter__ ") or, to the extent the qualifying nature of
such disclosure with respect to a specific representation and warranty is
readily apparent therefrom, as set forth in the Company Reports (as defined in
Section 5.1(e)) filed on or after January 1, 2004 and prior to the date
hereof (excluding any disclosures included in any such Company Report that are
predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:



(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization
and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly
existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority,
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the Companys certificate
of incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to date, and each as so
delivered is in full force and effect. As used in this Agreement, the term (i)
" _ _Subsidiary__ " means, with respect to any Person, any other Person of
which at least a majority of the securities or ownership interests having by
their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or other persons performing similar functions is directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by such Person or by one or more of its
respective Subsidiaries or by such Person and any one or more of its
respective



 

-9- Subsidiaries, _provided_ , _however_ , that Cingular LLC shall be considered a
Subsidiary of Parent solely for purposes of Sections 5.2(a), 5.2(e),
5.2(f)(iv) (subject to the limitation set forth in Section 5.2(f)(iv)),
5.2(g), 5.2(h), 5.2(i) and 6.1(iii) (subject to the limitation set forth in
Section 6.1(iii)), and (ii) " _ _Material Adverse Effect__ " means (x) a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, assets, liabilities,
business or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole, excluding any such effect resulting from (I) changes in political or
regulatory conditions generally, (II) changes or conditions generally
affecting the U.S. economy or financial markets or generally affecting any of
the segments of the telecommunications industry in which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries operates or (III) the announcement or consummation of this
Agreement, or (y) an effect that would prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any determination of " _
_Material Adverse Effect_ " _with respect to the Company shall exclude the
matters set forth in Section 5.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter.



(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of (x) 2,500,000,000 Shares, of which 799,007,457 Shares were outstanding as
of the close of business on January 27, 2005, and (y) 100,000,000 preferred
shares, par value $1.00 per share (the " _ _Company Preferred Shares__ "), of
which 2,000,000 shares were designated Subsidiary Exchangeable Preferred
Stock, Series 2 (the " _ _Subsidiary Preferred Shares__ "). 768,391.4
Subsidiary Preferred Shares were outstanding as of the close of business on
January 28, 2005. Each of the outstanding Subsidiary Preferred Shares is held
by a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, and the Subsidiaries of the
Company hold no other shares of capital stock of the Company, or securities
or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for such
capital stock. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. The Company has no Shares
or Company Preferred Shares reserved for issuance, except that, as of January
27, 2005, there were an aggregate of 30,733,276 Shares reserved for issuance
pursuant to the Company Stock Plans. Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter contains a correct and complete list as of December 31, 2004 of (i)
the number of outstanding Company Options under each of the Company Stock
Plans, the exercise prices of all Company Options and the number of Shares
issuable at each such exercise price and (ii) the number of outstanding
Company Awards under each of the Company Stock Plans, the date of grant and
number of Shares subject thereto. From December 31, 2004 to the date hereof
the Company has not issued any shares of Common Stock except pursuant to the
exercise of Company Options and the settlement of Company Awards outstanding
on December 31, 2004 in accordance with their terms, and except for issuances
under the Companys dividend reinvestment plan. From December 31, 2004 through
the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted
or issued any Company Options or Company Awards. Each of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid
and nonassessable and, to the extent owned by the Company or by a direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, is owned free and clear of
any lien, charge, pledge,



 

-10- security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each, a " _ _Lien__ "). Except
as set forth above, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no preemptive
or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital
stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire,
any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or
obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon
any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock
Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free and clear of any Lien. The Company does not have
outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of
which have the right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company on
any matter. Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
true and complete list of each Person in which the Company owns, directly or
indirectly, any voting interest that may require a filing by Parent or any " _
_Affiliate__ " (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the " _ _Exchange Act__ ")) of Parent under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _ _HSR
Act__ ").



(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_. (i) The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action
necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only to adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to
vote on such matter at a shareholders meeting duly called and held for the
purpose (the " _ _Company Requisite Vote__ "). This Agreement is a valid and
binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles
(the " _ _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception__ ").



(ii) The Board of Directors of the Company has (A) declared that the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and has
adopted this Agreement; (B) received the opinions of its financial advisors,

Dividend, is fair from a financial point of view to the holders of Shares
(other than Excluded Shares); (C) resolved to recommend adoption of this
Agreement to the holders of Shares (such recommendations being the " _
_Directors  Recommendation__"); and (D) directed that this Agreement be
submitted to the holders of Shares for their adoption.



(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts_. (i) Other than
the notices, reports, filings, consents, registrations, approvals, permits or



 

-11- authorizations (A) pursuant to Section 1.3; (B) required under the HSR Act,

Exchange Act; (C) with or to the Federal Communications Commission (the " _

local governments that have issued competitive access provider or other
telecommunications franchises or any other similar authorizations, no notices,
reports or other filings are required to be made by the Company with, nor are
any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to
be obtained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from, any domestic or
foreign governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body, court
or other legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity (each a " _
_Governmental Entity__ "), in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, or in
connection with the continuing operation of the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, except those that the failure
to make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.



(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation
or by-laws of the Company or the comparable governing documents of any of its
Subsidiaries; (B) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or default under, the
creation or acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of a Lien on
any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any
agreement, lease, license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture or other
legally binding obligation (a " _ _Contract__ ") binding upon the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with respect to performance of
this Agreement and consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby) compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 5.1(d)(i), any Law or governmental or non-governmental permit or
license to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject; or (C)
any change in the rights or obligations of any party under any Material
Contract (as defined in Section 5.1(j)(i)(I)) binding upon the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any change in pricing, put
or call rights, rights of first offer, rights of first refusal, tag-along or
drag-along rights or any similar rights or obligations which may be exercised
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby),
except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any such breach,
violation, termination, default, creation, acceleration or change that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material



 

-12- Adverse Effect. Section 5.1(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
a correct and complete list of Material Contracts of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to which consents or waivers are or may be required
prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(iii) As of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries holds claims, as creditor or claimant, of greater than

principles (" _ _GAAP__ ") consistently applied during the periods involved,
except as may be noted therein.



(iii) The management of the Company has (x) implemented disclosure controls

are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. Since the
Audit Date, any material change in internal control over financial reporting
required to be disclosed in any Company Report has been so disclosed.

methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls relating to periods after the Audit
Date, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting
or auditing practices (except for any of the foregoing after the date hereof
which have no reasonable basis), and (y) no attorney representing the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation, relating to periods after

agents to the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof or,
to the knowledge of the officers of the Company, to any director or officer of
the Company.



(f) _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since the Audit Date the Company and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not
engaged in any material transaction other than in accordance with, the

review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of the officers of Parent,
threatened, except for any such investigations or reviews that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has
obtained and is in substantial compliance with all Licenses necessary to
conduct its business as presently conducted, except those the absence of
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

have conducted their respective businesses only in, and have not engaged in
any material transaction other than in accordance with, the ordinary course of
such businesses. Since the Audit Date, there has not been any Parent Material

a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(iii) Parent shall not knowingly take or permit any of its Subsidiaries to
take any action or refrain from taking any action the result of which would
be reasonably and foreseeably likely to prevent the consummation of the Merger
by the Termination Date. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall not, and
it shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement for the
acquisition of any business or Person which  



 

-41-  provides interexchange telecommunications or long distance services, other
than (x) the provision of such services in _de minimis_ amounts or (y)
any provision of such services solely as a component of the provision of
mobile wireless voice or data services. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, except

approve in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
or (C) as set forth in Section 6.1(iii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter,

-42- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.1(iii),
to the extent they relate to Cingular LLC and its Subsidiaries, Parents
obligations in Section 6.1(iii) shall be limited to taking such steps, such as
the exercise of any veto rights, that are within the unilateral power and
control of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than Cingular LLC and its
Subsidiaries), and none of the foregoing shall require any of Parents
representatives (or require Parent to compel any of its representatives) to
take any actions that would violate the fiduciary duties of
such representatives under applicable Law with respect to any beneficial
owners of equity securities of Cingular LLC or its Affiliates other than
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.



6.2. _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall cause its and its Subsidiaries
employees, agents and representatives, including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries (" _
_Representatives__ "), not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal
or offer with respect to (1) a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company, (2) any purchase
of an equity interest or interests representing, in the aggregate, an amount
equal to or greater than a 15% voting or economic interest in the Company or
(3) any purchase of assets, securities or ownership interests representing an
amount equal to or greater than 15% of the consolidated assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (any such inquiry, proposal or offer
being hereinafter referred to as an " _ _Acquisition Proposal__ "). The
Company further agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of
the officers and directors of it or any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it
shall cause its and its Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, have any discussions with, or provide any confidential information
or data to, or engage in any negotiations with, any Person relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise knowingly encourage or facilitate any
effort or attempt by any Person other than Parent and Merger Sub to make or
implement an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of
Directors from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under Sections
14d-9 and 14e-2 of the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if such disclosure has
the substantive effect of withdrawing, modifying or qualifying the Directors
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or the adoption of this Agreement
by the Board of Directors of the Company, Parent shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.4(a); and (ii) at any time
prior to, but not after, the time this Agreement is adopted by the Company
Requisite Vote, (A) providing information in response to a request therefor by
a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
if the Board of Directors of the Company receives from the Person so
requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement (excluding
standstill provisions) on customary terms; (B) engaging in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors of the Company receives from
such Person an executed confidentiality agreement (excluding standstill
provisions) on customary terms;  



 

-43-  or (C) recommending or agreeing to recommend such an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal to the shareholders of the Company, if and only
to the extent that, (x) in each such case referred to in clause (A), (B) or
(C) above, the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
after consultation with outside legal counsel that such action is necessary in
order for its directors to comply with their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; (y) in the case referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside counsel), taking into account all
legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal, the likelihood of
obtaining financing, and the Person making the proposal, that such Acquisition
Proposal, if consummated, is more favorable, from a financial point of view
(taking into account the likelihood of consummation), to the Companys
shareholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each
case taking into account any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.2(c); and (z) in the
case of clause (C), Parent shall have had written notice of the Companys
intention to take the action referred to in clause (C) (a " _ _Notice of
Superior Proposal__ ") at least five business days prior to the taking of
such action by the Company and the Company shall have complied with the
provisions of Section 6.2(c); _provided_ , that any more favorable Acquisition
Proposal referred to in clause (y) above must involve at least 50% of the
assets or equity securities of the Company rather than the 15% used in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal (any such more favorable Acquisition
Proposal being referred to in this Agreement as a " _ _Superior__
__Proposal__ ").



(b) The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a
transaction with the Company to return or destroy all confidential information
furnished prior to the execution of this Agreement to or for the benefit of
such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform its
Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.2. 



(c) The Company agrees that it will notify Parent as promptly as practicable
(and, in any event, within 24 hours) if any inquiries, proposals or offers
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal are
received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions
or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of
its Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of
such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposal or offer and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, on the status and
terms of any such proposal or offer and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations. The Company agrees that (i) during the five-business day period
prior to its taking any action referred to in clause (ii)(C) of the proviso
in Section 6.2(a) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives  



 

-44-  regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by Parent and (ii) the Company may take any such action
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that was a Superior Proposal only if
such Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal in light of any
revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement to
which Parent shall have agreed prior to the expiration of such five business-
day period; _provided_ that no such Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
a Superior Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.2 if (A) Parent shall have
agreed to revisions to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(B) the Board of Directors of the Company shall not have reasonably determined
in good faith that such transactions as so revised are not substantially
equivalent to or better than such Acquisition Proposal, from a financial
point of view (taking into account the likelihood of consummation), to the
shareholders of the Company. The Company agrees that it will deliver to Parent
a new Notice of Superior Proposal with respect to each Acquisition Proposal
that has been materially revised or modified prior to taking any action to
recommend or agreeing to recommend such Acquisition Proposal to the
shareholders of the Company and that a new five business-day period shall
commence, for purposes of this Section 6.2(c), with respect to each such
materially revised or modified Acquisition Proposal from the time Parent
receives a Notice of Superior Proposal with respect thereto. The Company also
agrees to provide any information to Parent that it is providing to another
Person pursuant to this Section 6.2 at the same time it provides it to such
other Person.



6.3. _Information Supplied_. Each of the Company and Parent agrees, as to
itself and its Affiliates, that none of the information supplied or to
be supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (i) the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed with
the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of the shares of Parent
Common Stock in the Merger (including the prospectus and proxy statement (the
" _ _Prospectus/Proxy Statement__ ") constituting a part thereof) (the " _
_S-4 Registration Statement__ ") and any amendment or supplement thereto will,
at the time the S-4 Registration Statement becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and (ii) the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders of the Company
and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting (as defined in Section 6.4),
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The Company and Parent will cause the S-4 Registration
Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.



6.4. _Shareholders Meeting; Subsidiary Preferred Stock_. (a) The Company will
take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation
and by-laws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares
(the  



 

-45-  " _ _Shareholders Meeting__ ") as promptly as practicable after the S-4
Registration Statement is declared effective, and in any event will use its
reasonable best efforts to convene the Shareholders Meeting not later than 120
days after the date of this Agreement (or, if later, not more than 60 days
after effectiveness of the S-4 Registration Statement), to consider and vote
upon the adoption of this Agreement. Subject to its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company shall make the
Directors Recommendation, the Directors Recommendation shall be included in
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the Board of Directors of the Company
shall take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of Shares. In the event that subsequent to the date of this Agreement
the Board of Directors of the Company determines after consultation with
outside counsel that its fiduciary duties under applicable Law require it to
withdraw, modify or qualify the Directors Recommendation in a manner adverse
to Parent, the Board of Directors of the Company may, subject to the
requirements of Section 6.2, so withdraw, modify or qualify the Directors
Recommendation, _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to Section 6.4(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company shall nevertheless submit this
Agreement to the holders of Shares for adoption at the Shareholders Meeting
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to do so within the time period
prescribed herein.



(b) Prior to the Effective Date, the Company shall and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, as necessary, to effect an exchange of all of the Subsidiary
Preferred Shares then outstanding for shares of a new series of Company
Preferred Shares established by the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _
_Substitute Preferred Shares__ ") having rights, preferences and limitations
substantially identical to the rights, preferences and limitations of the
Subsidiary Preferred Shares set forth in Article Third, Part C. of the
Charter, except that in lieu of the provisions set forth in Sections
(C)(1) and (F) of such Article Third, Part C., the entitlement of the
Substitute Preferred Shares in respect of a consolidation, merger, combination
or other similar transaction and the voting rights of the Substitute Preferred
Shares shall be as set forth in Schedule 6.4(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter. Such exchange shall be effected on the basis of one Substitute
Preferred Share for each Subsidiary Preferred Share, with each fraction of a
Subsidiary Preferred Share being exchanged for an equal fraction of a
Substitute Preferred Share. Upon consummation of such exchange, the Subsidiary
Preferred Shares shall be cancelled by the Company in accordance with Section
515 of the NYBCL and shall not be reissued. The Board of Directors of
the Company shall take all other actions necessary so that immediately prior
to the Effective Time, the only Company Preferred Shares outstanding shall be
768,391.4 Substitute Preferred Shares and that all of such Substitute
Preferred Shares shall then be held of record and beneficially only by wholly
owned Subsidiaries of the Company.



6.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_. (a) Parent and the Company shall
promptly after the date of this Agreement prepare and Parent shall file with
the SEC the S-4 Registration Statement as promptly as practicable thereafter.
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4 Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and the Company shall promptly thereafter mail
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to the holders of Shares.



 

-46- (b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement
and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable, including
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect
all necessary notices, reports and other filings (including by filing no
later than 20 business days after Parents receipt of the schedule to be
provided by the Company pursuant to Section 6.1(ii)(A) all applications
required to be filed with the FCC and the notification and required form under
the HSR Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to file within 20
business days will not constitute a breach of this Agreement) and to obtain as
promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and
authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Section 6.5 (i) shall require, or be construed to
require, Parent or the Company to take or to refrain from taking any action,
to agree to any restriction with respect to any assets or operations of Parent
or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, or to cause their respective
Subsidiaries to do or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case that
would take effect prior to the Effective Time, or (ii) shall require, or be
construed to require, Parent or the Company to take or to refrain from taking
any action, to agree to any restriction with respect to any assets or
operations of Parent or the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, or to
cause their respective Subsidiaries to do or agree to do any of the
foregoing, if any such action, failure to act, restriction or agreement,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on Parent and its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (it being understood that, for this
purpose, materiality shall be considered by reference to the properties,
assets, liabilities, business and results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, rather than that of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), in each case applying the principles set
forth in Section 6.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter (a " _ _Specified
Material Adverse Effect__ "). Subject to applicable Laws relating to
the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other
on, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the S-4 Registration Statement). To
the extent permitted by law, each party shall provide the other with copies of
all correspondence between it (or its advisors) and any Governmental Entity
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the
extent reasonably practicable, all telephone calls and meetings with a
Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall include Representatives of Parent and the Company. In exercising the
foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable.



 

-47- (c) To the extent permitted by law, the Company and Parent each shall, upon
request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its Affiliates, directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the S-4
Registration Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application
made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 



(d) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any change,
fact or condition of which any of its officers has knowledge that is
reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect or of any failure
of any condition to Parents obligations to effect the Merger. Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company of any change, fact or condition of which
any of its officers has knowledge that is reasonably expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition to the
Companys obligations to effect the Merger.



(e) Subject to the second proviso set forth in Section 6.5(b), Parents and
the Companys obligations under this Section 6.5 shall include, without
limitation, the obligation to use their respective reasonable best efforts
to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including using reasonable best efforts to
seek to have any stay or other injunctive relief which would prevent or
materially delay or impair the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement entered by any court or other Governmental Entity reversed
on appeal or vacated.



(f) Each of the Company and Parent will promptly notify the other if
it becomes aware of any significant deficiencies in its internal control over
financial reporting that, alone or combined with other significant
deficiencies, would constitute a material weakness in its internal control
over financial reporting. 



6.6. _Access and Reports_. Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents
officers and other authorized Representatives (including environmental
consultants) reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout
the period prior to the Effective Time,  



 

-48-  to its properties, books, contracts and records and, during such period, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to
Parent all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
may reasonably be requested, _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by the Company herein, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing
shall not require the Company to permit any inspection, or to disclose any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in
the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
inspection or disclosure.



6.7. _Publicity_. The initial press release disclosing this Agreement shall
be a joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall
consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise
making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings
with any third party or any Governmental Entity (including any national
securities exchange) with respect thereto, except as may be required by
applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange or by the request of any
Governmental Entity.



6.8. _Employee Benefits_. (a) Parent agrees that it shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor all Compensation and Benefit Plans in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, subject to any
amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by the terms of such
plan and applicable Law. Parent agrees that, for a period from the Effective
Time through the first anniversary of the last day of the plan year of each
Compensation and Benefit Plan in which the Effective Time occurs, those
individuals who as of the Effective Time were employees or former employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than employees covered by a
collective bargaining agreement) (the " _ _Affected Employees__ ") shall be
provided compensation and employee benefits other than plans involving the
issuance of Shares and Company Awards and other than payments or benefits
made by reason of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any incremental increase in value attributable to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement no less favorable in
the aggregate than those provided to the Affected Employees immediately before
the Effective Time _provided_ , _however_ , that in determining whether and
under what standards equity compensation awards will be granted to Affected
Employees, Parent shall apply substantially the same criteria as Parent uses
for its other business units. For purposes of the preceding sentence, in the
case of any Compensation and Benefit Plan for which the plan year is uncertain
(or in the case of compensation not provided under a Compensation and Benefit
Plan), the plan year shall be deemed to be the calendar year, _provided_ that,
in any event, the period described in the preceding sentence shall be greater
than 12 months and less than 24 months, provided that Parent agrees that to
the extent required under a Compensation and Benefit Plan in effect as of the
date of this Agreement it shall require any successor to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any portion of the business or assets of the  



 

-49-  Company or the Surviving Corporation to assume an appropriate portion of the
obligations of Parent under this Section 6.8. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained herein shall obligate Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of either of them to (i) maintain any particular
Compensation and Benefit Plan (other than the Company Severance Plans, as
defined in the immediately following sentence, and the matters described on
Section 6.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule), (ii) grant or issue any
equity or equity-based awards or (iii) retain the employment of any Affected
Employee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the second anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
continue each of the Severance Plans identified in Section 6.8(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the " _ _Company Severance Plans__ ") without any
change that is adverse to the Affected Employees who participate as of the
Effective Time, to the extent required under each Company Severance Plan as of
the date of the Agreement.



(b) For all purposes under the compensation and employee benefit
plans, policies or arrangements of Parent and its Affiliates providing
benefits to any Affected Employees after the Effective Time (the " _ _New
Plans__ "), each Affected Employee shall receive credit for his or her service
with the Company and its Affiliates before the Effective Time (including
predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company
and its Affiliates have given credit for prior service), for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (but not (i) for purposes of benefit
accrual under defined benefit pension or other retirement plans or (ii) for
any new program for which credit for benefit accrual for service prior to the
effective date of such program is not given to similarly situated employees
of Parent other than the Affected Employees) to the same extent that such
Affected Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar or comparable Compensation and Benefit Plans
(except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of accrual of
benefits). In addition, if Affected Employees or their dependents are included
in any medical, dental, health or other welfare benefit plan, program or
arrangement (a " _ _Successor Plan__ ") other than the plan or plans in which
they participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _ _Prior Plan__
"), each Affected Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all Successor Plans and such Successor
Plans shall not include any restrictions, limitations or exclusionary
provisions with respect to pre-existing conditions exclusions, any actively-
at-work requirements or any proof of insurability requirements (except to the
extent such exclusions or requirements were applicable under any similar Prior
Plan at the Effective Time), and any eligible expenses incurred by any
Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the
plan year of the Prior Plan ending on the date of the employees participation
in this Successor Plan begins shall be taken into account under this Successor
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to the Affected Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if these amounts had been
paid in accordance with the Successor Plan.



 

-50- (c) With respect to matters described in this Section 6.8 relating to benefits
or compensation to be provided after the Effective Time, the Company will to
the extent permitted by applicable Law provide Parent with copies of any
broad-based notices or other communication materials of a general nature prior
to sending them.



(d) Prior to the Closing, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company shall cause to be amended the employee benefit plans
and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries to the extent necessary to provide
that no employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries shall commence to
participate therein following the Effective Time unless the Surviving
Corporation or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such participation. In
addition, prior to the Closing, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
the terms of the applicable plan or arrangement, Parent shall cause to be
amended the employee benefit plans and arrangements of it and its Subsidiaries
to the extent necessary to provide that no employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall commence to participate therein following the Effective
Time unless Parent or such Subsidiary explicitly authorizes such
participation.



 

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor the terms of any collective bargaining agreements to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.



(f) Parent shall take all necessary action to effectuate the agreements set
forth on Section 6.8(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter.



(g) Parent shall cause its Board of Directors and the Board of Directors of
the Surviving Corporation to adopt prior to the Effective Time
such resolutions as may be requested by the Company to exempt the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from the provisions of Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act to the maximum extent permitted by Law.



(h) the Company shall take the actions set forth on Section 6.8(h) of
the Company Disclosure Letter.



6.9. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 6.12, 6.13 and 8.5,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense.



6.10. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation agrees
that it will jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless each present
director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case,
for acts or failures to act in such capacity), determined as of the Effective
Time (the " _ _Indemnified Parties__ "), against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (collectively, " _ _Costs__ ") incurred in connection
with any claim,  



 

-51-  action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law (and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Person is not entitled to indemnification); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any determination as to whether an Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder shall
be made by independent counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation and such
Person.



(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this Section 6.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent of any liability it may have to
such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially and
actually prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the
right to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation does
not elect to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties
advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent
or the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall jointly and severally be obligated to pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph (b)
to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties would
present such counsel with a conflict of interest; _provided_ , that the
fewest number of counsel necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be
used; (ii) the Indemnified Parties will use their reasonable efforts to
cooperate in the defense of any such matter, and (iii) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
their prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not have any obligation under this Agreement to
any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable law.



(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain the Companys existing officers and directors  



 

-52-  liability insurance (" _ _D andO Insurance__") (including for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby) covering each such Indemnified Person
covered as of the Effective Time by the Companys officers and directors
liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no
less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof, for a
period of six years after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any
one year an amount in excess of 200% of the current annual premium paid by
the Company (which annual premium is set forth on Schedule 6.10(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter) for such insurance (such 200% amount, the " _
_Maximum Annual Premium__ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. In addition,
the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy prior to the
Effective Time on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified
Parties than the existing directors and officers liability insurance
maintained by the Company; _provided_ , that the amount paid by the Company
shall not exceed six times the Maximum Annual Premium. If such "tail" prepaid
policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such policy in full force and effect, for its full term, and continue
to honor their respective obligations thereunder, and all other obligations
under this Section 6.10(c) shall terminate.



(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.10 shall not be terminated or modified by such parties in a manner so as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.10 applies
without the consent of the affected Indemnified Party. If Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of
the obligations set forth in this Section.



(e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs
and legal representatives.



(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal
representatives under this Section 6.10 shall be in addition to any rights
such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any other
applicable Laws.



 

-53- 6.11. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute becomes applicable to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
and its Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are necessary so that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and by the Merger and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on such transactions.



6.12. _Regulatory Compliance_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to (a) cure no later than the Effective
Time any material violations and defaults by any of them under any applicable
rules and regulations of the FCC (the " _ _FCC Rules__ ") and the FAA Rules
other than as specified in Section 6.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter,
(b) comply in all material respects with the terms of the FCC Licenses and the
FAA Rules and file or cause to be filed with the FCC and the FAA all material
reports and other filings to be filed under applicable FCC Rules and FAA Rules
and (c) take all actions reasonably requested in writing by Parent for each
of them to be in compliance effective upon the consummation of the Closing
with the provisions of Sections 271 and 272 of the Communications Act of 1934,
as amended (including any orders issued by the FCC interpreting or
implementing such provisions). Parent agrees that it shall reimburse the
Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company
following incurrence and delivery of reasonable documentation by the Company
at the request of Parent pursuant to clause (c) of this Section 6.12. For
purposes of Section 6.12, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall not
be required to cure at the applicable time any alleged material violation or
default with any applicable rule or regulation of the FCC or the FAA Rules for
any matter that is pending at any of the FCC, the FAA or a court until such
time that there is a final and nonappealable order or decision holding that
the Company or its Subsidiary is in material violation or default of the
applicable rule or regulation.



6.13. _Potential Sale of Interests_. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time (or earlier termination of this Agreement), to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Parent to facilitate the disposition
immediately prior to, at or after the Effective Time of those assets or
ownership interests held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a) that
are identified on Section 6.13 of the Parent Disclosure Letter or (b) that are
identified by Parent in writing to the Company as assets or ownership
interests the holding of which would be inconsistent with Parents strategic
objectives and the value of which in the aggregate does not exceed
$100,000,000 (such assets or interests described in clause (a) or (b) referred
to as a " _ _Potential Sale Interest__ "). To the extent reasonably requested
by Parent, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) permit Persons whom Parent identifies to the
Company as potential purchasers of a Potential Sale Interest to conduct
(and cooperate with such Persons) reasonable investigations with respect to
such Potential Sale Interest ( _provided_ that any such Person executes and
delivers to the Company a confidentiality agreement containing customary
terms), (ii) comply with any applicable right of first refusal, right of
first offer, right of approval or similar provisions  



 

-54-  that may be applicable to a proposed transfer of a Potential Sale Interest,
and (iii) deliver such notices, make such filings and execute such
Contracts relating to the disposition of Potential Sale Interests as
reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ that neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any such Contract under which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be required to dispose of any
Potential Sale Interest other than immediately prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, or to agree to restrictions on their businesses or operations
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall be permitted to identify potential
purchasers of Potential Sale Interests and negotiate any Contracts with
respect to dispositions of Potential Sale Interests; _provided_ that the
Company may (and, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, shall)
participate in such negotiations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) Parent
shall reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for their reasonable out-of-
pocket costs in complying with this Section 6.13 promptly following incurrence
and delivery of reasonable documentation of such costs, and (B) the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to breach the terms of any Contract
with respect to such Potential Sale Interest.



6.14. _Transfer Taxes_. Each of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub and
the shareholders of the Company shall pay any sales, use, ad valorem,
property, transfer (including real property transfer) and similar Taxes
imposed on such Person as a result of or in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall be liable for any such Tax that is imposed on its shareholders
in respect of assets that are owned directly or indirectly by the Company.



6.15. _Taxation_. Subject to Section 6.2, neither Parent nor the
Company shall take or cause to be taken any action, whether before or after
the Effective Time, that would disqualify the Merger as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent and the Company agree
that if it shall become necessary in order to satisfy the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.2(f) and 7.3(c), the Merger shall be restructured to
include in the Per Share Merger Consideration the per Share amount of the
Special Dividend that would otherwise be payable as contemplated by Section
6.18.



6.16. _Stock Exchange Listing and De-listing_. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be authorized for listing on the NYSE upon official
notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date. The Surviving Corporation
shall use its best efforts to cause the Shares to be no longer listed on the
NYSE and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following
the Effective Time.



6.17. _GSA Action_. The Company shall notify Parent promptly if it becomes
subject to any GSA Action with respect to the provision of services by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any United States Federal Governmental
Entity.



6.18. _Special Dividend_. Following the date of the adoption of this Agreement
by holders of Shares constituting the Company Requisite Vote at the
Stockholders Meeting and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
declare and pay  



 

-55-  a special dividend of $1.30 per Share (the " _ _Special Dividend__ ")
payable to holders of record of outstanding Shares as of a record date for
the Special Dividend set by the Board of Directors of the Company, such
Special Dividend to be payable no later than the Effective Time. Subject to
applicable Law, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Special Dividend to be paid prior to the Effective Time on the Closing Date.

described in Section 7.1(b)(i), Section 7.1(b)(ii), Section 7.1(b)(iii)

-58-  vacating, reversing, setting aside, annulling, suspending or modifying such

impose any term, condition or consequence that would reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect).

agreements contained in this Section 8.5(b) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to

Sub commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the
fee, charges or expenses to which reference is made in this paragraph (b), the
Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date

contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge that in the event
that the Termination Fee and/or out-of-pocket expenses



 

-62- become payable and are paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.5(b),
the Termination Fee and out-of-pocket expenses shall be Parents and Merger
Subs sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under this Agreement.

its respective disclosure letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the
section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one
section of a disclosure letter need not be set forth in any other section of
