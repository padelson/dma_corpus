Closing Net Working Capital, and the (v) Aggregate Exercise Price and a
calculation of the Total Merger Consideration based on the foregoing amounts
(the amount so calculated being referred to herein as the "Estimated Total
Merger Consideration") and (B) based on the foregoing calculations, the
Spreadsheets; _provided_ , _however_ that Parent shall have the right to
review and comment on the Closing Financial Certificate (including the
calculation of Estimated Total Merger Consideration) upon its delivery by the
Company, and the Company shall thereafter promptly consider Parents comments,
and make any corresponding modifications to the Closing Financial Certificate
and/or each Spreadsheet in good faith consideration of Parents comments. The
Company shall provide to Parent, promptly after Parents request, copies of
the documents evidencing the amounts set forth on any such draft or final
document.

(c) _Preparation and Delivery of Post-Closing Statement_. As promptly
as practicable, but in no event later than ninety (90) calendar days after
the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared
and delivered, to the Representative a certificate (the "Post-
Closing Statement"), executed by an executive officer of Parent, setting
forth Parents good faith calculation of (i) the amount of Company Closing
Cash, (ii) the amount of Company Closing Debt, (iii) the amount of
Company Merger Expenses, (iv) the amount of Closing Net Working Capital,
together with a calculation of the Total Merger Consideration based on the
foregoing amounts as well as reasonably detailed supporting documentation for
such calculation and any additional information reasonably requested by the
Representative. The Post-Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and using the same accounting principles, practices,
procedures, policies and methods, with consistent classifications, that were
employed in the preparation of the Company Financial Statements and as set
forth on _Exhibit F_. Any component of the Closing Financial Certificate that
is not disputed in the Post-Closing Statement shall be final and binding on
the Parties and not subject to appeal.

(d) _Review of Post-Closing Statement_. Parent shall provide the
Representative and its Representatives with reasonable access (with the right
to make copies), during normal business hours upon reasonable advance notice
by the Representative and its Representatives, to the work papers of Parent,
its accountants or any of its other Representatives related to the
preparation of the Post-Closing Statement, as well as to any of the personnel,
property and facilities and such books and records and other relevant
information of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and Parent shall make
available its employees knowledgeable about the information used in, and the
preparation of, the Post-Closing Statement. The Representative shall have
thirty (30) days following its receipt of the Post-Closing Statement (the
"Review Period") to review

 



22  the same together with information requested in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(d)_ (which shall be promptly provided by Parent). On or
before the expiration of the Review Period, the Representative shall deliver
to Parent a written statement accepting or disputing the Post-Closing
Statement. In the event that the Representative shall dispute the Post-Closing
Statement, such statement shall include a reasonably detailed itemization of
the Representatives objections and the reasons therefor (such statement, a
"Dispute Statement"). Any component of the Post-Closing Statement that is not
disputed in a Dispute Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties and
not subject to appeal. If the Representative does not deliver a Dispute
Statement to Parent within the Review Period or delivers a statement accepting
the Post-Closing Statement, the Post-Closing Statement shall be final and
binding on the Parties and not subject to appeal.

(e) _Dispute Resolution_. If the Representative delivers a Dispute
Statement during the Review Period, Parent and the Representative shall
promptly meet and attempt in good faith to resolve their differences with
respect to the disputed items set forth in the Dispute Statement during the
thirty (30) calendar days immediately following Parents receipt of the
Dispute Statement, or such longer period as Parent and the Representative may
mutually agree (the "Resolution Period"). Any such disputed items that
are mutually resolved in writing by Parent and the Representative during the
Resolution Period shall be final and binding on the Parties and not subject to
appeal. If Parent and the Representative do not mutually resolve in writing
all such disputed items by the end of the Resolution Period, Parent and the
Representative shall submit all items remaining in dispute with respect to the
Dispute Statement to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (in each case, as Parent and
the Representative shall reasonably agree) (the "Accounting Firm") for review
and resolution. The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not an
arbitrator. The Accounting Firm shall make all calculations in accordance with
the Company Financial Statements referenced in _Section_ __ _ 3.9_ and
_Section_ __ _ 9.14_, shall determine only those items remaining in dispute
between Parent and the Representative, and shall only be permitted or
authorized to determine an amount with respect to any such disputed item that
is within the range of the amount of such disputed item as proposed by Parent
in the Post-Closing Statement and the amount of such disputed item as proposed
by the Representative in the Dispute Statement. Each of Parent and the
Representative shall (i) enter into a customary engagement letter with the
Accounting Firm at the time such dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm
and otherwise cooperate with the Accounting Firm, (ii) have the opportunity
to submit a written statement in support of their respective positions with
respect to such disputed items, to provide supporting material to the
Accounting Firm in defense of their respective positions with respect to such
disputed items and to submit a written statement responding to the other
Partys position with respect to such disputed items and (iii) subject to
customary confidentiality and indemnity agreements, provide the Accounting
Firm with access to their respective books, records, personnel and
Representatives and such other information as the Accounting Firm may require
in order to render its determination. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed
to deliver to Parent and the Representative a written determination (such
determination to include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations
used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information
provided to the Accounting Firm by Parent and the Representative) of the
disputed items within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the disputed
items, which determination shall be final and binding on the Parties and not
subject to appeal. All fees and expenses relating to the work (if any) to be
performed by the Accounting Firm will be allocated between Parent, on the one
hand, and the Representative (on behalf of the

 



23  Effective Time Holders), on the other hand, in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Accounting Firm
that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as finally determined by
the Accounting Firm) bears to the total disputed amount of such items so
submitted. Such allocation calculation shall be made by the Accounting Firm as
part of its determination.

 

(f) _Post-Closing Payments_.

 

(i) The Total Merger Consideration, calculated based on (i) the amount of
Company Closing Cash, (ii) the amount of Company Closing Debt, (iii) the
amount of Company Merger Expenses and (iv) the amount of Closing Net Working
Capital, each as deemed final and binding on the Parties pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_, is referred to herein as the "Final Merger
Consideration".

(ii) If the amount of the Final Merger Consideration exceeds the amount of
the Estimated Total Merger Consideration (such excess amount, the "Positive
Adjustment"), then, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of
the Final Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, (A)
Parent shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited in the Exchange Fund held
by the Payments Administrator, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount in cash equal to the portion of the Positive Adjustment to
which holders of Company Capital Stock and Company Warrants are entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ and the Payments Administrator shall remit
the portion of the Positive Adjustment to the holders of Company Capital
Stock and Company Warrants in accordance with each holders Securityholders
Pro Rata Share, and (B) Parent shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited
with the Surviving Corporation (or the Surviving Corporations designee), by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount in cash equal to the
portion of the Positive Adjustment to which the holders of Vested Company
Options are entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ and the Surviving
Corporation shall remit the portion of the Positive Adjustment to the holders
of Vested Company Options in accordance with each holders Securityholders
Pro Rata Share.

 

(iii) If the amount of the Estimated Total Merger Consideration exceeds the
amount of the Final Merger Consideration (the "Negative Adjustment"), the
amount of such Negative Adjustment shall be deemed to be Damages for which
Parent shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article 11_ and,
within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, Parent and the
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to, and the Escrow Agent shall, deliver promptly (and in no event later than
five (5) Business Days after the date of receipt of such instruction by the
Escrow Agent) from the Escrow Cash to Parent the amount of the Negative
Adjustment in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account or
accounts designated by Parent in writing. To the extent that the Negative
Adjustment is greater than the then remaining Escrow Cash, Parent shall have
the right to proceed individually and directly against the Effective Time
Holders for indemnification with respect to any amounts payable.

(iv) Any payment made under this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law, shall be treated for all Tax purposes as
an adjustment to the Total Merger Consideration.

 



24 (v) For clarity, the process set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ shall
be the exclusive remedy of Parent and the Representative for disputes related
to the Closing Financial Certificate, Post-Closing Statement and Dispute
Statement and any amounts set forth therein.

 

2.5 _Tax Consequences and Withholding_.

 

(a) The parties intend that the Merger shall be treated as a taxable
purchase of securities of the Company pursuant to the Code. The Company and
the Company Securityholders are relying solely on their own Tax advisors in
connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions or
agreements contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Parent, the Payments Administrator, and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Company Securityholder the amounts required to be deducted
and withheld under any Applicable Law, with respect to the making of such
payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company
Securityholder in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made. Any
of Parent or Parents agents that deducts and withholds any amount from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement shall provide to
any Company Securityholder on which withholding is imposed such documentation
as may reasonably be required to support the Company Securityholders claim
of having paid the withheld amounts to applicable Tax Authorities.

 

2.6 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time before or after the Effective
Time, Parent reasonably believes or is advised that any further instruments,
deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or desirable to
consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement or any Company Ancillary Agreement, Merger Sub Ancillary Agreement
or Parent Ancillary Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then the
Company, Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
officers and directors shall execute and deliver all such proper deeds,
assignments, instruments and assurances and do all other things reasonably
necessary or desirable to consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes
and intent of this Agreement, the Company Ancillary Agreements, the Merger Sub
Ancillary Agreements and the Parent Ancillary Agreements.

(a) _Schedule_ __ _ 3.14(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists
all United States, international and foreign Patents, registered trademarks
and applications to register trademarks, registered Internet domain names,
registered copyrights and applications for copyright registration, and any
other Intellectual Property that is the subject of an application,
certificate, filing, registration or other document issued, filed with, or
recorded by any Governmental Authority owned or purported to be owned by,
registered or filed in the name of, 

 



35  or exclusively licensed to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the

Company has taken reasonable actions to maintain, police and protect such
Company Registered Intellectual Property. As of the Agreement Date, all
registration, maintenance and renewal fees currently due in connection with
such Company Registered Intellectual Property have been paid and all
documents, recordations and certificates in connection with such Company
Registered Intellectual Property currently required to be filed have
been filed with the relevant patent, copyright, trademark or other
authorities in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, as the case may be,
for the purposes of prosecuting, maintaining and perfecting such Company
Registered Intellectual Property and recording the Companys ownership
interests therein. _Schedule 3.14(a)(ii)_ sets forth a complete and accurate
list of all material software that is owned, or purported to be owned, by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Company Software").

(b) _Schedule 3.14(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
accurately identifies and describes each Company Product currently being
designed, developed, manufactured, marketed, distributed, provided, licensed
or sold by the Company or any Subsidiary.

 

(c) All Company Registered Intellectual Property is valid and enforceable
and in full force and effect, and has not lapsed, been abandoned, been
disclaimed, been cancelled or been forfeited, in whole or in part, and, to the
Companys knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that would reasonably
be likely to provide a basis for abandonment, invalidity, cancellation,
forfeiture, or unenforceability. To the knowledge of the Company, all
inventions claimed in Patents within Company Registered Intellectual Property
are patentable in the jurisdiction in which each issued Patent is granted or
each pending Patent is filed.

(i) Each Patent listed on _Schedule 3.14(a)(i)_ properly identifies all
inventors who should have been named as inventors in accordance with the
Applicable Laws of the jurisdiction in which such Patent is issued or is
pending, and each such inventor has executed a valid and enforceable written
agreement assigning all of such inventors rights, title, and interests in
and to such Patent (including the inventions and discoveries claimed or
otherwise disclosed therein) to the Company, its Subsidiaries or licensor of
the Company, and all such assignments have been timely and properly recorded
with the USPTO, and to the extent applicable and required or permitted by
Applicable Laws, its foreign equivalents. To the extent any Patent included in
the Company Registered Intellectual Property has been assigned to the Company
or its Subsidiaries by any Person, including for example, a Person who is not
an inventor of such Patent but was otherwise granted a right to such Patent,
any and all such Persons have each executed a valid and enforceable
written agreement assigning all of such Persons rights, title, and interests
in and to such Patents (including the inventions and discoveries claimed

 



36  or otherwise disclosed therein) to the Company or its Subsidiaries, and all
such assignments have been timely and properly recorded with the USPTO, and to
the extent applicable and required or permitted by Applicable Laws, its
foreign equivalents.

(ii) No trademark or trade name owned, used, or applied for by the Company
or its Subsidiaries conflicts or interferes with any trademark or trade name
owned, used, or applied for by any other Person. No event or circumstance
(including a failure to exercise adequate quality controls and an assignment
in gross without the accompanying goodwill) has occurred or exists that has
resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the abandonment of
any trademark (whether registered or unregistered) owned or applied for by the
Company or its Subsidiaries.

(iii) The Company and its Subsidiaries have, and to the Companys
knowledge, its licensors have properly filed, prosecuted and maintained all
Company Registered Intellectual Property. Each item of Company Registered
Intellectual Property and at all times has been in compliance with all legal
requirements and all filings, payments, and other actions required to be made
or taken to maintain such item of Company Registered Intellectual Property in
full force and effect have been made by the applicable deadline.

 

(iv) No interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination, or other
proceeding is or has been pending or, to the best of the Companys knowledge,
threatened, in which the scope, validity, or enforceability of any Company IP
Rights is being, has been, or could reasonably be expected to be contested or
challenged. To the best of the Companys knowledge, there is no basis for a
claim that any Company IP Rights is invalid or unenforceable as a result of
patent or copyright misuse or on any other grounds.

 

(v) Except as set out in _Section_ __ _ 3.14(c)(v)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
is not otherwise obligated under, any Contract to make payments or provide
other consideration (in any form, including royalties, milestones, and other
contingent payments) for use of, licensing of, exploitation of or to have
rights to any of the Company-Owned IP Rights, and all money currently due and
payable in connection with such Contracts has been satisfied in a timely
manner.

 

(d) _Schedule 3.14(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth an
accurate and complete list of all Contracts relating to any right or interest
in, to or under any Company IP Rights (including all licenses, options,
settlement agreements, coexistence agreements, covenants not to sue, non-
assertion protections, immunities from suit, consent agreements, assignments,
and security interests) that have been granted (A) to the Company or its
Subsidiaries (excluding (x) assignments recorded at the United States Patent
and Trademark Office ("USPTO") or its foreign equivalent for Company IP
Rights owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries evidencing the Companys or
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, sole and exclusive ownership thereof, (y)
non-exclusive licenses for generally commercially available "off-the-shelf"
Software that is not embedded in any Company Products or used in the
development, maintenance or support of such Products, and (z) licenses for
Open Source Materials), or (B) by the Company or its Subsidiaries to any other
Person (other than (1) customary confidentiality agreements, (2) customary
powers of attorney granted to the Companys or its Subsidiaries patent
prosecution counsel solely for purposes of representing the Company or its
Subsidiaries before the USPTO or its foreign 

 



37  equivalent, and (3) Contracts with the customers of the Company in the
ordinary course of business, which do not deviate in any material respect from
the Companys standard form of customer agreement). _Schedule 3.14(d)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter also states whether any rights, licenses or
interests granted in each Company IP Contract are exclusive. Neither the
Company nor its Subsidiaries is bound by, and no Company IP Rights are
subject to, any covenant or other provision that in any way limits or
restricts the ability of the Company or its Subsidiaries to use, exploit,
assert or enforce any Company IP Rights anywhere in the world. Accurate
and complete copies of all Contracts listed on _Schedule 3.14(d)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter have been made available to Parent prior to the
Agreement Date. The Company and its Subsidiaries are each in material
compliance with all relevant Company IP Contracts and, with respect to
sublicenses granted to Company and its Subsidiaries, to the knowledge of the
Company, the Companys and the Subsidiaries licensor is in material
compliance with all agreements granting such Intellectual Property rights to
such licensor. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have received any
notice of breach or default, and to the knowledge of the Company there are no
facts or circumstances that would reasonably be likely to provide a basis for
receiving any such notice of breach or default, under any Company IP Contract.
Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.14(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has entered into any
Contract (A) granting any Person the right to bring any infringement actions
with respect to, or otherwise to enforce any rights with respect to, any of
the Company-Owned IP Rights; or (B) granting any Person the right to control
the prosecution, maintenance or defense of any of the Company-Owned IP
Rights.

(e) The Company has provided to the Parent a complete and accurate copy of
each standard form of Company IP Contract used by the Company and its
Subsidiaries during the period covered by the Company Financial Statements,
including each standard form of (a) end user license agreement or standard
terms and conditions of sale; (b) development agreement; (c) distributor or
reseller agreement; (d) employee agreement relating to Company IP Rights or
confidentiality; (e) consulting or independent contractor agreement relating
to Company IP Rights or confidentiality; (f) service level, maintenance or
support agreement; and (g) confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement (each, a
"Standard Form of IP Agreement").  _Schedule 3.14(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter accurately identifies each Company IP Contract that deviates
in any material respect from the corresponding standard form agreement
provided to the Parent.

 

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries own and have good and exclusive title
to each item of Company-Owned IP Rights, free and clear of any Encumbrances
(other than Permitted Encumbrances). None of the Company-Owned IP Rights
developed by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or licensed or
acquired by the Company or its Subsidiaries by assignment or paid license,
has been developed, in whole or in part, using any funding or other resources
of any Governmental Authority or academic institution or is subject to any
restriction or obligation pursuant to the Patent and Trademark Law Amendments
Act, 35 U.S.C. §200 et seq. (as may be amended or succeeded from time to
time, and the regulations promulgated thereunder) or any similar Law of any
other jurisdiction. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has
ever been a member or promoter of, or a contributor to, any industry
standards body or similar organization that could require or obligate the
Company or its Subsidiaries to disclose, or to grant or offer to any other
Person any license or right to, any Company-Owned IP Rights. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has assigned or otherwise transferred
ownership of, or agreed to assign or otherwise transfer ownership of, any
Company-Owned IP Rights to any other Person.

 



38 (g) None of the Company-Owned IP Rights have been or are subject to
any pending or outstanding injunction, directive, order, judgment or other
disposition of dispute that adversely restricts, or when any such pending
dispute is concluded may adversely restrict, the use, transfer, registration,
licensing or other exploitation of any such Intellectual Property by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, or otherwise adversely affects, or may affect,
the scope, validity, use, right to use, registrability or enforceability of
any Company-Owned IP Rights.

 

(h) The Company IP Rights include all Intellectual Property presently being
used in, and necessary for the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted and as currently planned to be conducted.

 

(i) The operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
previously practiced and currently conducted and as currently planned to be
conducted did not and does not infringe or misappropriate or otherwise violate
any Third-Party IP Rights. As of the Agreement Date, there are no pending
Actions, and the Company has not received any written, or to the knowledge of
the Company any other, notice threatening any Actions, which involves a claim
of infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Third-Party IP Rights,
including in the form of a cease-and-desist letter or offer or invitation to
obtain a license. To the Companys knowledge, there is no material
unauthorized use, unauthorized disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of
any Company-Owned IP Rights by any third party. As of the Agreement Date, the
Company has not instituted any Actions or otherwise made any accusations
(including in the form of cease-and-desist letters or offers or invitations to
obtain a license) to any Person regarding claims of infringement or
misappropriation of any Company-Owned IP Rights.

(j) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has taken reasonable steps to
protect, preserve and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of the trade
secrets and confidential information of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
to preserve and maintain all the Companys and its Subsidiaries interests,
proprietary rights and trade secrets in the Company-Owned IP Rights. All
current and former officers, employees, consultants and independent
contractors of the Company and its Subsidiaries having access to proprietary
information of the Company or its Subsidiaries have executed and delivered to
the Company valid and enforceable written agreements that include customary
confidentiality and restriction on use terms sufficient to protect the non-
disclosure and restricted use of such proprietary information. Except as set
forth in _Schedule 3.14(j)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has secured valid and enforceable written
agreements from all of such entitys current and former consultants,
independent contractors and employees who were involved in, or who contributed
to, the creation or development of any Company-Owned IP Rights, that assigns
to the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, all right, title and
interest in and to such Company-Owned IP Rights. Accurate and complete copies
of the agreements referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 3.14(j)_ have been made
available to Parent prior to the Agreement Date, and no such agreement
includes any material exceptions or deviations from the Standard Form of IP
Agreement. No material breach of any agreement referenced in this _Section_ __
_ 3.14(j)_ by the other party thereto (a "Counter-Party") has
been threatened or, to the knowledge of the Company, has occurred. To the
knowledge of the Company, no employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries is

 



39  (a) bound by or otherwise subject to any Contract restricting him from
performing his duties for the Company or Subsidiaries, as applicable, or (b)
in breach of any Contract with any former employer or other Person concerning
Intellectual Property or confidentiality due to his or her past activities as
an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

(k) Neither the execution and delivery or effectiveness of this Agreement
nor the performance of the Companys obligations under this Agreement (or any
of the Company Ancillary Agreements) will cause (i) the forfeiture, loss or
termination of, or lien on, or give rise to a right of forfeiture, loss or
termination of, or lien on any Company-Owned IP Right, (ii) additional
payment obligations by the Company in order to use or exploit the Company IP
Rights to the same extent as Company was permitted before the Agreement Date,
(iii) a material breach of any Company IP Contract, (iv) the release,
disclosure, or delivery of any source code of any Company Software to any
escrow agent or other Person, or (v) the grant, assignment or transfer to any
other Person of any license or other right or interest under, to, or in any
of the Company-Owned IP Rights.

(l) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14(l)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not disclosed, delivered or
licensed to any Person or agreed to disclose, deliver or license to any
Person, any source code for any Company Software, except for disclosures to
employees, contractors or consultants under Contracts that prohibit use or
disclosure except in the performance of services to the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken appropriate, and at
a minimum customary in the industry, actions to document the Company
Software, such that the materials comprising such Software, including the
source code and documentation, have been written in a clear and professional
manner so that they may be understood, modified, used and maintained by a
reasonably competent programmer with customary knowledge in the industry. No
event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) will, or would reasonably
be expected to, result in the disclosure or release, or requirement for
disclosure or release, of any of the source code of the Company Software. The
Company and its Subsidiaries are in possession of the source code and object
code for, and documentation applicable to, each version of the Company
Software.

(m) _Schedule 3.14(m)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all Open

distributed with any of the current Company Products, including, with respect
to each Open Source Material listed therein, (i) the name of the Open Source
Material including its version number, (ii) the applicable license including
its version number, and (iii) a description as to whether the Open Source
Material has been (a) modified, or (b) distributed. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with the terms and conditions of
all licenses for the Open Source Materials set forth in _Schedule 3.14(m)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries
have used or distributed any Open Source Materials in such a way that would
obligate, or purport to obligate, the Company or its Subsidiaries under the
terms of the licenses governing such Open Source Materials to: (1) distribute,
license or make available to any third party the source code incorporated
into, combined with or distributed with any Company Products (other than the
applicable Open Source Material itself in its unmodified form); (2) the
Company or its Subsidiaries to permit third parties to modify or create
derivative works of the source code of the Company Products (other than the
applicable Open Source Material itself in its unmodified form); or (3) license
or distribute the Company Products for free or at a de minimis cost.

 



40 (n) The Company and its Subsidiaries have sufficient rights to use
all Software, middleware and systems, information technology equipment,
hosting facilities and associated documentation used or held for use in
connection with the operation of their respective businesses including
Software included in Company Products (the " _IT Assets_ "), all of which
rights shall survive unchanged, and without any material change in the terms
and conditions under which Company currently has such rights, following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. The IT Assets operate
and perform in all material respects in accordance with their documentation,
express and implied warranties, and functional specifications and otherwise as
required by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the operation
of their businesses. The IT Assets have not materially malfunctioned or failed
and do not contain any viruses, bugs, faults, Trojan Horses, spyware, malware,
malicious code or files or other devices or effects that may, or may be used
to, (i) enable or assist any Person to access without authorization the IT
Assets; or (ii) otherwise interrupt, destroy or otherwise significantly
adversely affect the functionality or operation of the IT Assets or
any Company Product. To the knowledge of the Company, no Person has gained
unauthorized access to any IT Assets.

 

(o) The Company and its Subsidiaries have developed, implemented,
maintained and used appropriate administrative, organizational, technical and
physical safeguards to preserve the security, integrity and confidentiality
of, and prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of, access to, destruction of,
loss or alteration of Personal Data, any Software, trade secrets, or source
code included in the Company-Owned IP Rights. Such safeguards (i) meet all
requirements of Applicable Law in all material respects (including any
encryption requirements imposed by Applicable Law); (ii) meet or exceed
accepted security standards in the industry; and (iii) are documented and
kept current. There has not been a breach in the security, integrity,
confidentiality, use, disclosure, or access to Personal Data, Software, trade
secrets, or source code included in the Company-Owned IP Rights. The Company
and its Subsidiaries have in place written agreements with the third party
owners and operators of all data centers which provide services related to or
used in connection with operation of the businesses as set forth on _Section_
__ _ 3.14(o)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, and all such agreements

all service level agreements relating to the IT Assets, copies of which have
been provided to Parent prior to the Agreement Date. Except as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 3.14(o)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, all service
level agreements entered into by the Company are substantially in the form of
the Standard Form of IP Agreement for such service level agreement.

(p) No Company Software contains any "back door," "drop dead device,"
"time bomb," "Trojan horse," "virus," or "worm" (as such terms are commonly
understood in the software industry) or any other code designed or intended
to have, or capable of performing, any of the following functions: (a)
disrupting, disabling, harming, or otherwise impeding in any manner the
operation of, or providing unauthorized access to, a computer system or
network or other device on which such code is stored or installed; or (b)
damaging or destroying any data or file without the users consent.

 



41 (q) None of the Company Software (a) contains any bug, defect, or error
(including any bug, defect, or error relating to or resulting from the
display, manipulation, processing, storage, transmission, or use of date data)
that materially and adversely affects the use, functionality, or performance

bugs, defects, and errors in the current versions of the Company Software.

 

3.15 _Compliance with Laws_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
and has at all times been in compliance in all material respects with all
Applicable Law. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries holds all material
permits, licenses and approvals from, and has made all material filings with,
government agencies and authorities, that are necessary and/or legally
required to be held by it to conduct the Company Business ("Governmental
Permits"), and all such Governmental Permits are valid and in full force and
effect.

 

3.16 _Certain Transactions and Agreements_. None of the officers and
directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries and, to the actual knowledge

Subsidiaries, has any direct or indirect ownership interest in any firm or
corporation that competes with, or does business with, or has any contractual
arrangement with, the Company or its Subsidiaries (except with respect to any
interest in less than 1% of the stock of any corporation whose stock is
publicly traded). None of said officers, directors, employees or stockholders,
is a party to, or otherwise interested in, any Contract with the Company or
its Subsidiaries, except for normal compensation for services as an officer,
director or employee incurred in the ordinary course of business, consistent
with past practice. For clarity, no disclosure shall be required pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 3.16_ with respect to portfolio companies of the
Companys venture capital, private equity or angel investors.

 

3.17 _Employees, ERISA and Other Compliance_.

 

(a) The Company has made available to Parent a correct and complete list of
all material (other than mandatory government or social security
arrangements): (i) "employee benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, (ii) employee benefit plans, policies, agreements or arrangements, and
(iii) payroll practices, including employment, consulting or other
compensation agreements, or bonus or other incentive compensation, stock
purchase, equity or equity-based compensation, deferred compensation, change
in control, severance, sick leave, vacation, loans, salary continuation,
health, life insurance and educational assistance plan, policies, agreements
or arrangements with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has any obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, for current or
former employees, consultants or directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Plans"). Neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has any agreement, commitment or obligation, to create, enter
into or contribute to any additional Company Plan, or

 



42  to modify or amend any existing Company Plan. The terms of each Company Plan
permit the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, as applicable, to amend and
terminate such Company Plan at any time and for any reason without penalty
and without liability or expense (other than reasonable expenses associated
with such termination).

 

(b) Correct and complete copies of the following documents with respect to
each of the Company Plans have been delivered or made available to Parent by
the Company to the extent applicable: (i) any material plans and related trust
documents, insurance contracts or other funding arrangements, contracts
relating to the maintenance or administration of such plans, and all material
amendments thereto, (ii) the Form 5500s filings and all schedules thereto, if
applicable, for the three most recent plan years; (iii) the most recent
actuarial valuation report, if any, (iv) the most recent IRS determination or
opinion letter, if any, (v) the most recent summary plan descriptions, (vi)
written summaries of all non-written Company Plans, and (vii) all material
correspondence, if any, to or from any Governmental Authority relating to an
Applicable Law with respect to such Company Plans.

 

(c) The Company Plans have been established and maintained in all material
respects with their terms and in material compliance with all applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Applicable Law.

(d) At no time has the Company or any ERISA Affiliate contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to, or otherwise participated in, any (i)
multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or (ii) multiple
employer plan (within the meaning of Sections 4063/4064 of ERISA and Section
413(c) of the Code). Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has (i) ever
sponsored, participated in, contributed to, or had any liability with respect
to, any pension plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code.

(e) At no time has the Company or any ERISA Affiliate adopted or
maintained (formally or informally) any Company Plan for the benefit of any
employee performing services outside the United States. At no time has the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate maintained, established, sponsored,
participated in or contributed to any self-insured plan that provides
benefits to employees (including any such plan pursuant to which a stop loss
policy or contract applies).

 

(f) The Company Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 or other Tax-
favored treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code
are so qualified, and any trusts intended to be exempt from federal income
Taxation under the Code are so exempt. Nothing has occurred with respect to
the operation of the Company Plans that could cause the loss of such
qualification or exemption, or the imposition of any liability, penalty or Tax
under ERISA or the Code. No event has occurred and no condition exists
with respect to any Company Plan subject to the requirements of Section
401(a) of the Code that would subject the Company, either directly or by
reason of an ERISA Affiliate of the Company, to any material Tax, fine, Lien,
penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other Applicable
Law.

(g) All material contributions required to have been made under any of the
Company Plans or by Applicable Law (without regard to any waivers granted
under Section 412 of the Code), have been timely made.

 



43 (h) All material amendments and actions required to bring the
Company Plans into conformity in all material respects with all of the
applicable provisions of the Code, ERISA and other Applicable Law have been
made or taken, except to the extent that such amendments or actions are not
required by Applicable Law to be made or taken until a date after the
Effective Time.

(i) None of the Company Plans require post-employment life or health
coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant, except as
may be required under Part 6 of the Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Section
4980B of the Code or any similar state law and at the expense of the
participant or the participants beneficiary. Neither the Company nor any of
its ERISA Affiliates has ever represented, promised or contracted (whether in
oral or written form) to any employee (either individually or to employees as
a group) or any other Person that such employee(s) or other Person would be
provided with life insurance, health or other employee welfare benefits post-
termination, except to the extent required by Applicable Law.

 

(j) None of the Company Plans is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code). Each Company Option (A)
was originally granted with an exercise price that the Board, based on a
reasonable valuation method, determined to be equal to or greater than the
fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock on the date of grant (B)
has no feature for the deferral of compensation other than the deferral of
recognition of income until the later of exercise or disposition of such
Company Option; and (C) to the extent it was granted after December 31, 2004,
was granted with respect to a class of stock of the Company that is "service
recipient stock" (within the meaning of Section 409A and the proposed or final
regulations or other Internal Revenue Service guidance issued with respect
thereto).

(k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other
Company Ancillary Agreements nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby will result in (i) any payment becoming due to
any Employee, (ii) the provision of any benefits or other rights to any
Employee, (iii) the increase, acceleration or provision of any payments,
benefits or other rights to any Employee, whether or not any such payment,
right or benefit would constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code, or (iv) require any contributions or payments to
fund any obligations under any Company Plan.

 

(l) Any individual who performs services for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and who is classified by the Company or such of its Subsidiaries
as a consultant, independent contractor, or something other than an employee
is, to the knowledge of the Company, properly classified under applicable Tax
and other Applicable Law and is not an employee under such Applicable Law.
Any individual employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
classified as exempt meets the requirements for such classification under
Applicable Law.

 

(m) None of the Employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
represented in his or her capacity as an Employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any labor organization. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has recognized any

 



44  labor organization, nor has any labor organization been elected as the
collective bargaining agent of any Employees, nor has the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries entered into any collective bargaining agreement or union
contract recognizing any labor organization as the bargaining agent of any
Employees. There is no union organization activity involving any of the
Employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has there ever been union
representation involving any of the Employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There are no strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts,
arbitrations, grievances or other labor disputes involving any of the
Employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened. There are no complaints, charges or
claims against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened relating to any employee or consultants
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is in compliance with all Applicable Law relating to the
employment of labor, including all such Applicable Law relating to wages,
hours, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and any similar
state or local "mass layoff" or "plant closing" Law ("WARN"),
collective bargaining, discrimination, civil rights, safety and health,
workers compensation and the collection and payment of withholding and/or
social security taxes and any similar tax, except for immaterial non-
compliance. There has been no "mass layoff" or "plant closing" (as defined by
WARN) with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and
its Subsidiaries have paid in full to all employees, independent contractors
and consultants all wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, benefits and other
compensation due to or on behalf of such employees, independent contractors
and consultants, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
arrears with respect to any such payments. To the knowledge of the Company, no
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any term
of any employment agreement, non-competition agreement or any restrictive
covenant to a former employer relating to the right of any such employee to be
employed by the Company or any Subsidiaries. No employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries has given notice of his or her resignation, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
intends to terminate his or her employment with the Company.

 

3.18 _No Brokers_. Neither the Company nor any Affiliate of the Company is
obligated for the payment of any fees or expenses of any investment banker,
broker, finder or similar party in connection with the origin, negotiation or
execution of this Agreement or in connection with the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (other than fees and expenses
payable to Raymond James and Associates, Inc.). Neither Parent nor the Surviving

commercial, product liability, fire and casualty insurance policies with
coverage customary for companies of similar size engaged in similar lines of
business. As of the Agreement Date, there are currently no claims pending
against the Company under any insurance policies currently in effect and
covering the property, business or employees of the Company, and (i) all
premiums due and payable with respect to the policies maintained by the
Company have been paid to date, (ii) no default exists thereunder and (iii)
with respect to any material claims made under such policies, no insurer has
made any "reservation of rights" or refused to cover all or any portion of
such claims. As of the Agreement Date, the Company has not received any
notice of any proposed material increase in the premiums payable for coverage
under, or proposed termination of, any such policies or arrangements.

 



45 3.20 _Environmental Matters_.

 

(a) The Company is not in violation of any applicable Environmental Law,
and to the knowledge (without inquiry or investigation) of the Company, no
material expenditures are or will be required in order to comply with any such
Environmental Law.

 

(b) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 3.20_: "Environmental Law" means

such customers, suppliers, vendors and service providers are good commercial
working relationships.

of its privacy practices in its Privacy Statements and the Companys and its

and the Company Software when used for its intended purpose, complies with,
all Applicable Law, including applicable Privacy Law and Data Protection Law,
and applicable guidance and codes of practice having the force of law that are
associated with or promulgated under such Applicable Laws. Neither the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the transfer of any Personal Data to Parent or Merger Sub, will
cause, constitute, or result in a breach of violation of any Privacy Laws,
Data Protection Laws, or any of the Companys Privacy Statements or any
contractual obligation of the Company governing the privacy or security of
Personal Data. No claims have been asserted or, have been threatened in
writing, or to the knowledge of the Company orally, against the Company or its
Subsidiaries by any person or entity alleging a violation of such persons or
entitys privacy, personal or confidentiality rights.

(b) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries has received, and the Company
has no knowledge of, any circumstance (including any circumstance arising as
the result of an audit or inspection carried out by any Governmental Authority
or any other Person) that has given rise to or would reasonably be expected
to give rise to, any notice, court order, warrant, regulatory opinion, audit
result, or allegation, from a Governmental Authority, tribunal or court in any
jurisdiction or any other Person: (A) alleging or confirming non-compliance
with any applicable Privacy Law, Data Protection Law or Privacy Statement; (B)

relating to the collection, retention, storage, disposal, use, processing,
disclosure, transfer, protection, security, or distribution, of Personal
Data. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor its

notification or reporting requirement to any Person or Governmental
Authority under any Privacy Laws or Data Protection Laws related to the use,
transfer, processing or disclosure of Personal Data.

 

(c) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have been involved in a
dispute in respect of any violation or alleged violation of applicable
Privacy Laws or Data Protection Laws or Privacy Statement. Neither the Company

Incident.

 



47 (d) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all permits and licenses,
and have made all governmental filings, required under applicable Data
Protection Laws to process, use and transfer Personal Data, as applicable. The
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause
any such permit or license to be invalidated, or be required under applicable
Data Protection Laws to be amended.

(e) Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have suffered or experienced
any incident resulting in any actual or reasonably suspected loss of
unauthorized use or disclosure of, access to, handling of, or other
unauthorized processing of, Personal Data (a " _Security Incident_ ") to any
Person or recipient outside the Company or its Subsidiaries or to any Person
or recipient within the Company or its Subsidiaries whose receipt of such
Personal Data either was not in good faith or not for the business purposes
of Company or its Subsidiaries, and, no circumstance has arisen: (i) in which
applicable Privacy Laws or Data Protection Laws, would require the Company to
notify a Governmental Authority, the media, any of its employees, customers
or any other Person of a Security Incident, or (ii) in which applicable
guidance or codes of practice promulgated under applicable Privacy Laws or
Data Protection Laws would recommend the Company to notify any of the
foregoing of a Security Incident.

(f) Each of the Companys and its Subsidiaries past and present
collection, disposal, use, analysis, disclosure, retention, processing,
storage, security sale and dissemination of Personal Data: (i) has not
occurred without first obtaining any required consents or other required legal
basis for such activity; and (ii) complies with, and has not violated in any

to bring such systems into compliance with the requirements of the Privacy
Laws and when effective, GDPR as applicable, including protection of data and
security requirements, systems that manage the rights of data subjects, and

Plan) that the Company is legally entitled to unilaterally terminate no later
than the day immediately prior to the Closing Date. If Parent so requests that
the Companys 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Companys Board of Directors
shall adopt resolutions terminating the 401(k) Plan and the Company shall
execute an amendment to the 401(k) Plan that is sufficient to assure

who the Company or Parent reasonably believes is, with respect to the Company

Section 280G of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as
determined immediately prior to the initiation of the requisite stockholder
approval procedure under _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_, and who the Company
believes might otherwise receive, have received, or have the right or
entitlement to receive payments and/or benefits that may, separately or in
the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code,
unless the requisite stockholder approval of such payment and/or benefits is
obtained pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 5.12(b)_.

(b) The Company shall submit for approval by such number of stockholders
of the Company as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code so as to render the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of the

the absence of the executed Parachute Payment Waivers might otherwise result,
separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any amount and/or the
provision of any benefit that would not be deductible by reason of Section
280G of the Code, with such stockholder approval to be obtained in a manner
which satisfies all applicable requirements of such Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

5.13 _Notices to Company Securityholders and Employees_. The Company shall
timely provide to holders of Company Capital Stock, Company Options and

connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company
Bylaws, each Company Option Plan, the Company Warrants or other applicable
Contracts.

 

5.14 _Termination of Contracts_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to terminate prior to the Closing, the Contracts set forth
in _Schedule 5.1_ _4_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, which terminations
shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Parent; _provided, however_ ,
that the Company shall not, as a condition to obtaining the consent to any
such termination from the applicable counter-party to a Contract, agree to
provide additional consideration or otherwise agree to incur an additional
liability (beyond that which is already contemplated by the Contract) without
the prior written consent of Parent.

5.15 _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_.

 

(a) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy or
cause to be satisfied all the conditions precedent set forth in _Article 9_ ,
and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper,
or advisable to consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



57 (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to cooperate in all respects with Parent and its Representatives
in connection with the preparation and review of any filing required to be
made on behalf of Parent before any Governmental Authority or pursuant to any
listing or securities exchange requirement, and such reasonable best efforts

and its Representatives such books, records and other information as any of
the foregoing may reasonably request and (B) furnishing all financial

ARTICLE 6

 

PARENT COVENANTS

 

During the time period from the Agreement Date until the earlier to occur of
(a) the Effective Time or (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with the provisions of _Article_ __ _ 10_, Parent covenants and agrees with
the Company as follows:

 

6.1 _Advice of Changes_. Parent shall promptly advise the Company in
writing of (a) any event occurring subsequent to the Agreement Date that
would render any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained
in _Article 4_ untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_ would not be satisfied, (b) any breach of any covenant
or obligation of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement, any Parent
Ancillary Agreement or any Merger Sub Ancillary Agreement such that the
condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ would not be satisfied or (c)
any change, event, circumstance, condition or effect that would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the other conditions set forth in _Article 8_ not to
be satisfied;  _provided, however_ , that that Parents unintentional failure
to give notice under this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ shall not be deemed to be a
breach of covenant under this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ but instead
shall constitute only a breach of the underlying representation or warranty
or covenant or condition, as the case may be.

 

6.2 _Regulatory Approvals_. Parent shall promptly execute and file any
application, notification (including any notification or provision of
information, if any, that may be required under the HSR Act) or other document
that may be necessary in order to obtain the authorization, approval or
consent of any Governmental Authority, whether foreign, federal, state, local
or municipal, which may be reasonably required in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any Parent Ancillary Agreement or any Merger Sub Ancillary
Agreement. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
such authorizations, approvals and consents and shall pay any associated
filing fees (including filing fees payable in connection with filings under
the HSR Act) payable by Parent with respect to such authorizations, approvals
and consents. Parent shall promptly inform the Company of any material
communication between Parent and any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. If Parent or 

 



58  any Affiliate of Parent receives any formal or informal request for
supplemental information or documentary material from any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, then Parent
shall make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable, a response
in compliance with such request. Parent shall direct, in its sole discretion,
the making of such response, but shall consider in good faith the views of
the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any federal, state or foreign statutes, rules,
regulations, orders or decrees that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade, it is expressly understood and agreed that while Parent shall
exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cause the withdrawal of such
action or proceeding Parent shall be under no obligation to execute or carry
out agreements or submit to orders providing for (1) the sale, transfer,
license or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of
a trust or otherwise) of any assets, categories of assets, operations or
categories of operations of Parent or any of its Affiliates or the
Company, (2) the discontinuation of any product or service of Parent or any
of its Affiliates or the Company, (3) the imposition of any limitation or
regulation on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to freely conduct
their business or own their respective assets or (4) the holding separate of
the shares of Company Capital Stock or any limitation or regulation on the
ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to exercise full rights of
ownership of the shares of Company Capital Stock (any of the foregoing, an
"Antitrust Restraint").

6.3 _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all of the
conditions precedent that are set forth in _Article 8_ , and Parent shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper, or advisable to
consummate and make effective, as promptly as practicable the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Parent also covenants and agrees with the Company as follows:

6.4 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall extend an offer of employment
to all of the employees of the Company, with such offers (1) to be on
substantially similar terms applicable to employees of Parent who are
similarly situated based on levels of responsibility (but which are in no
event less favorable than those currently in place at the
Company), including, without limitation, providing a salary or wage level and
bonus opportunity no less than the salary or wage level and bonus opportunity
to which such individual was entitled immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(2) subject to limitations under Applicable Law, given full credit for each
such employees service with the Company prior to the Closing Date for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, and determination of the level of benefits,
under any benefit plans, including but not limited to gratuity, made
available to such employees following the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of service or in excess of applicable Parent policies and (3) to
be effective upon the Closing, if accepted.

 



59 (b) Immediately following the Effective Time, each employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time who
remains an employee of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries or
becomes an employee of Parent immediately following the Effective Time (each,
a "Continuing Employee") shall be eligible to participate in Parents
employee benefit plans (the "Parent Plans"), including its medical plan,
dental plan, life insurance plan and disability plan, on substantially similar
terms applicable to employees of Parent who are similarly situated based on
levels of responsibility, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and the
terms of the applicable Parent Plans; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall
not be obligated to enroll any Continuing Employee in Parent Plans if Parent
maintains in effect a comparable Company Benefit Arrangement for the benefit
of such employee following the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, for Continuing Employees so enrolled in Parent Plans, Parent shall
recognize the prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries of each of
the Continuing Employees for purposes of eligibility and vesting, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law and the terms of the applicable Parent
Plans and for purposes of accrual of vacation and time off benefits. In
addition, for purposes of each Parent Plan providing health or welfare
benefits for the benefit of any Continuing Employees, Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements, waiting periods
and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Plan (for insured benefit
plans, to the extent permitted under the terms of the insurance policy) for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, and to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law and the terms of the applicable Parent Plans, Parent will
cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the applicable benefits
plan in which such employee participated immediately before the Effective Time
ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding Parent
Plan begins to be taken into account under such Parent Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such Parent Plan (for insured benefit plans, to the extent permitted under the
terms of the insurance policy) Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __
_ 6.4_ to the contrary, this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ shall not operate to (a)
duplicate any benefit provided to any Continuing Employee, (b) require Parent
to continue to maintain any employee benefit plan in effect following the
Effective Time for Parents employees, including the Continuing Employees, (c)
be construed to mean the employment of the Continuing Employees is not
terminable by Parent at will at any time, with or without cause, for any
reason or no reason or (d) amend any ERISA plan or create any third party
rights of causes of action for any person.

 

6.5 _Indemnification of Company Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) If the Merger is consummated, then until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or its successors to, fulfill and honor in all respects
the obligations of the Company to its current and former directors and
officers (the "Company Indemnified Parties") pursuant to any indemnification,
exculpation or expense advancement provisions under the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or Company Bylaws (as in effect on the Agreement Date) and
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and such
Company Indemnified Parties (existing as of the Agreement Date that are set
forth in _Schedule 3.16_ of the Company Disclosure Letter), with respect to
claims arising out of matters, acts or omissions 

 



60  occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (regardless of whether any
proceeding relating to any Company Indemnified Partys rights to
indemnification, exculpation or expense advancement with respect to any such
matters, acts or omissions is commenced before or after the Effective Time).
Any claims for indemnification made under this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_ on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive such
anniversary until the final resolution thereof.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a fully prepaid
"tail" policy under the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance policy, which (i) has an effective term of six years from the
Effective Time, (ii) covers those persons who are currently covered by the
Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy in
effect as of the Agreement Date for matters, acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time and (iii) contains other coverage terms
comparable to those under the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance policy (the "Company DandO Tail Policy"). The cost of the
Company DandO Tail Policy will be treated as a Company Merger Expense
hereunder. If the Merger is consummated, then Parent will not cancel the
Company DandO Tail Policy during its term.

 

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties (or
their heirs, personal representatives, successors or assigns). The Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
successors to, pay all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by any Company Indemnified Party (or his or her heirs, personal
representatives, successors or assigns) in any legal action brought by such
person that is successful to enforce the obligations of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or its successors under this Section 6.5. The obligations of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its successors under this Section 6.5
shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party (or his or her heirs, personal
representatives, successors or assigns) without the prior written consent of
such Company Indemnified Party (or his or her heirs, personal
representatives, successors or assigns, as applicable).

(d) However, no such Company Indemnified Party will have any right
of indemnification or right of advancement from the Surviving Corporation or
its successors or Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ with respect to
any Damages recoverable by any of the Parent Indemnified Persons from
such Company Indemnified Party in his or her capacity as an Effective Time
Holder pursuant to _Article 11_ of this Agreement.

 

6.6 _Retention Pool_. The Parent shall, as promptly as practicable
following the Effective Time, offer to certain Offered Employees equity
securities of Parent with such offered equity securities having an aggregate
value of not less than $15,000,000 (and, to the extent such Offered Employees
become Continuing Employees, grant such equity securities) and allocated
amongst such Offered Employees by Parent in consultation with Mr. Josh
McCarter; _provided_ that such allocations otherwise comply with _Section_ __
_ 6.7(b)_ (for clarity, these grants are in addition to any Adjusted Options
granted to such individuals pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)(vi)_). The

Parent (each, a "Promised Option Release"). 

(b) In lieu of the Promised Options set forth in _Schedule 6.7(B)_ of the

ARTICLE 7

CLOSING MATTERS

7.1 _The Closing_. Subject to termination of this Agreement as provided
in  _Article_ __ _ 10_, the Closing shall take place at the offices of
Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian, LLP, 220 West 42nd
Street, Floor 17, New York, New York 10036, on the Closing Date.
Concurrently with the Closing or at such later date and time as may be
mutually agreed in writing by the Company and Parent, the Certificate of
Merger shall be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State in accordance with
Delaware Law.

 

7.2 _Exchange_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, all outstanding Company Capital Stock, Company
Options and Company Warrants shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
further action, cease to exist, and all such securities shall be converted
into the right to receive from Parent the cash amount or other consideration
to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_,
if any.

(b) On the Closing Date, Parent shall make available to Acquiom Financial
LLC (the "Payments Administrator") cash in an amount sufficient to permit the
payment of the cash amounts to which holders of Company Capital Stock and
Company Warrants are entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ (the
"Exchange Fund"). As soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than five
Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Payments
Administrator to deliver or make electronically available to each holder of
record of Company Capital Stock and Company Warrants that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the certificates or other instruments
evidencing such securities being "Company Certificates") and which were
converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_
the following: (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Company Certificates for Company Capital Stock shall pass, only upon the
deemed surrender of such Company Certificates to the Payments Administrator);
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the deemed surrender of the
Company Certificates in exchange for the cash amounts specified in _Article 2_
( _provided that_ to the extent reasonably practicable, Parent will cause the
Payments Administrator to make electronic copies of such letter of
transmittal available to holders of Company Certificates in advance of the
Closing to allow submission thereof concurrent with the Closing). Upon (1)
delivery of such

 



62  letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and (2) delivery of any required Form W-9
or Form W-8, to the Payments Administrator, the Payments Administrator shall
pay by U.S. domestic electronic check (ACH), wire transfer or check to each
tendering holder of a Company Certificate or an Affidavit (each, a "Tendering
Company Holder") the cash amounts to which such Tendering Company Holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b_ _)_. For the avoidance of doubt,
unless required by Parent, a registered holder of record of Company
Certificates need not surrender the Company Certificates to the Payments
Administrator in order to receive the applicable cash amounts to which such
holder is entitled under this  _Article_ __ _ 7_ and upon valid completion
and submission of a Letter of Transmittal (including via online submission),
the underlying Company Certificates covered by such Letter of Transmittal
shall be deemed automatically surrendered _._

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than five Business
Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall pay to the Surviving Corporation
the cash amounts to which each holder of Company Options that are unexpired,
unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time is
entitled pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)(iv)_. Any payments made in
respect of Company Options pursuant to this Agreement, (i) that are made in
respect of Employee Options shall be made through the Surviving Corporations
standard payroll procedures (on or before the Surviving Corporations next
full regularly scheduled payroll following the date on which such amounts
become payable) and (ii) that are made in respect of Non-Employee Options
shall be promptly made by the Surviving Corporation through its accounts
payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or its transfer agent of
any Company Capital Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Company Certificates or Affidavits are presented for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Section_ __ _
7.2_.

 

(e) Until Company Certificates are deemed surrendered pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.2(b)_, such Company Certificates shall be deemed, for all purposes,
to evidence ownership of the amount of cash which Company Capital Stock shall
have been converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_.

 

(f) If any cash amount payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ is to be
issued or paid to a Person other than the Person to which the Company
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the payment thereof that the Company Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such exchange shall have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment
of cash in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Company
Certificate surrendered, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund held by the Payments Administrator
which have not been delivered to any holders of Company Certificates pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ within 12 months after the Effective Time shall
promptly be returned to Parent, and thereafter each holder of a Company
Certificate who has not theretofore complied with the 

 



63  exchange procedures set forth in and contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
7.2_ shall look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
similar laws) for his, her or its claim, only as a general unsecured creditor
thereof, to the cash payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any Company
Certificate or other required instrument has not been surrendered prior to
the date on which the merger consideration contemplated by _Section_ __ _
2.1(b)_ in respect of such Company Certificate or instrument would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any amounts
payable in respect of such Company Certificate or instrument shall, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Parent, but
remaining subject to the claims or interests of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of the
Payments Administrator, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall
be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

7.3 _Dissenting Shares_. If, in connection with the Merger, holders of
Company Capital Stock are entitled to appraisal rights pursuant to Delaware
Law, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into a right to receive cash
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_, but shall be converted into the right
to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to
such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Delaware Law. Each holder of Dissenting
Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of Delaware Law, becomes entitled to
payment of the fair market value of such shares shall receive payment
therefor in accordance with Delaware Law (but only after the value therefor
shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such law). In
the event that any Company Stockholder fails to make an effective demand
for payment or fails to perfect its appraisal rights as to its shares of
Company Capital Stock or any Dissenting Shares shall otherwise lose their
status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be
converted into the right to receive the consideration issuable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ in respect of such shares had such shares never been
Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof,
at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable after) the applicable time or
times specified in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, following the satisfaction of the
applicable conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, the cash, without
interest thereon, to which such Company Stockholder would have been entitled
under _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ with respect to such shares. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any demand received by the Company for appraisal
of Company Capital Stock or notice of exercise of a Company Stockholders
appraisal rights, and Parent shall have the right to control all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to any such demand. The Company agrees that,
except with Parents prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), it shall not voluntarily make any payment
or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demand for appraisal or exercise of appraisal rights.

_Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of Damages
that may be claimed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)_ exceeds $750,000 (the
"Deductible"), and once the Deductible has been reached, the Parent
Indemnified Person may make claims for indemnification for all Damages in
excess of the Deductible; _provided, however,_ for clarity, Aggregate Escrow
Cash will not be released from escrow to any Parent Indemnified Person until
claims for indemnification for Damages exceeding the Deductible have been
resolved in favor of the Parent Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Article
11.

(b) If the Merger is consummated, recovery from the Escrow Cash and the
RandW Policy shall be the sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement for the
Indemnifiable Matters arising out of _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)_, except for
breaches of Fundamental Representations or in the case of a Fraudulent breach
under _Section_ __ _ 11.2(a)_. In the case of any Indemnifiable Matters

under this Agreement. In the case of any breaches of Fundamental
Representations by the Company under this Agreement or Indemnifiable Matters
arising out _Section_ __ _ 11.2(b)_ to _(f)_ or _Section_ __ _ 11.2(h)_,
the Deductible shall not apply and each Effective Time Holder shall be liable
for such holders Pro Rata Share of the amount of any Damages resulting
therefrom; _provided, however_ , that such liability shall be limited to 100%
of the amount of the Total Merger Consideration actually received (or treated
as received not taking into account any reduction for Taxes withheld) by such

Effective Time Holders Escrow Pro Rata Share of the Shared Escrow Cash,
Specified Matter Escrow Pro Rata Share of the Specified Matter Escrow Cash,
Expense Pro Rata Share of the Expense Cash and Escalates Escalate Additional
Escrow Contribution).

 

(c) All claims for indemnification by a Parent Indemnified Person for
Damages pursuant to this Agreement (whether or not the Indemnifiable Matters
that are the subject matter of such claims are recoverable solely from the
Escrow Cash) shall be satisfied (i) first from the Escrow Cash, (ii) second
from the RandW Policy and (iii) third, after exhaustion of the Escrow Cash and
RandW Policy, against the Effective Time Holders directly (but not exceeding
such Effective Time Holders respective Pro Rata Shares of such Damages and
subject to the dollar limits set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 11.3(b)_).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Specified Matter
Escrow Cash shall be available as a separate escrow, held exclusively for
indemnification claims by a Parent Indemnified Person for Damages arising out
of or resulting from any of the matters set forth on _Schedule 11.2(g)_ and
all claims for indemnification by a Parent Indemnified Person for such
matters shall be satisfied, (i) first, from the Specified Matter Escrow Cash,
(ii) second, after exhaustion of the Specified Matter Escrow Cash, from the
Escrow Cash, and (iii) third, from the RandW Policy (if available).

 



71 (e) The Parent Indemnified Persons shall exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate the amount of any Damages, including without
limitation commercially reasonable efforts to recover under the RandW Policy;
_provided_ _that_ the Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be required to
recover under the RandW Policy prior to exhaustion of the Aggregate Escrow
Cash. Without limiting the foregoing, Damages shall be calculated net of
actual recoveries under existing insurance policies and contractual
indemnification or contribution provisions (in each case calculated net of
any actual collection costs and reserves, deductibles, premium adjustments and
retrospectively rated premiums); _provided, that,_ in the event that Parent
Indemnified Persons first recover from the Aggregate Escrow Cash or Effective
Time Holders for any particular Damages and thereafter recover for the same
Damages pursuant to any existing insurance policies and/or contractual
indemnification or contribution provisions, then the amount recovered pursuant
to such existing insurance policies (including the RandW Policy) and/or
contractual indemnification or contribution provisions (up to the amount first
recovered from the Aggregate Escrow Cash) shall be deposited in the escrow
fund or paid to the Effective Time Holders, as applicable, by Parent. In
addition, Damages shall exclude special, consequential, exemplary or punitive
damages, unless (i) specifically awarded by an arbitrator or Governmental
Authority to a third party and paid to such third party by a Parent
Indemnified Person or (ii) in the case of consequential damages only,
reasonably foreseeable under an objective standard.

 

(f) In determining the existence or amount of any Damages in respect of the
failure of any representation or warranty to be true and correct as of any
particular date or the breach of or default in connection with any covenant or
agreement, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect standard or
qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation,
warrant, covenant or agreement shall be disregarded (other than in instances
where the context dictates otherwise (e.g., the operation of this sentence
shall not turn references to "Company Material Contract" to "Company
Contract" or "Material Adverse Effect" to "Effect" for purposes of calculating
Damages)); _provided, however_ , that such standard or qualification shall not
be disregarded for the purposes of the initial determination of whether there
was a failure of such representation or warranty to be true and correct, or a
breach of or default in connection with any covenant or agreement, as
aforesaid.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that any
claim for Damages which are accrued but not yet paid or which are anticipated
to be incurred, paid or sustained in the future is resolved in favor of a
Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Article 11_ , no amounts shall
actually be payable by the Effective Time Holders (whether from the Aggregate
Escrow Cash or directly by the Effective Time Holders) to such Parent
Indemnified Person until after such Damages are actually incurred, paid or
sustained.

 

(h) Following the Closing, (i) this _Article 11_ shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy for recovery of money Damages by the Parent Indemnified
Persons for all Indemnifiable Matters, (ii) all applicable statutes of
limitations or other claims periods with respect to claims for Indemnifiable
Matters shall be shortened to the applicable claims periods and survival
periods expressly set forth herein and (iii) the Parent Indemnified Persons
irrevocably waive any and all rights they may have to make claims against the
Effective Time Holders under statutory and common law as a result of any
Damages and any and all other damages or losses incurred by the Parent
Indemnified Persons with respect to this Agreement whether or not in excess of
the maximum amounts permitted to be recovered pursuant to this _Article 11_.

 



72 (i) Except for such representations and warranties contained in Article 3,
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Company Closing Certificates, each of
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company or its
Representatives nor any Effective Time Holder or other Person makes, and
each of Parent and Merger Sub is not relying on, any other express, implied
or statutory representation or warranty with respect to the Company or Company
Business, any Effective Time Holder or otherwise, including with respect to
any projections, forecasts, estimates and budgets for the Company.

(j) Nothing herein shall limit the liability of an Effective Time Holder
for any Fraud personally committed by such Effective Time Holder.

11.4 _Notice of Claim_.

 

(a) As used herein, the term "Claim" means a claim for indemnification of
Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Person for Damages under this _Article
11_. Parent may give notice of a Claim under this Agreement, whether for its
own Damages or for Damages incurred by any other Parent Indemnified Person,
and Parent shall give written notice of a Claim executed by an officer of
Parent (a "Notice of Claim") to the Representative (with a copy to the Escrow
Agent) after Parent becomes aware of the existence of any actual or potential
claim by a Parent Indemnified Person for indemnification from the Effective
Time Holders under this _Article 11_ , arising out of or resulting from (i)
any Indemnifiable Matter listed in the foregoing clauses (a)-(h) of _Section_
__ _ 11.2_ or (ii) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against
Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Person of a claim, demand or Action
brought by a third party against Parent or such other Parent Indemnified
Person (in each such case, a "Third-Party Claim") that is based on, arises
out of or relates to any Indemnifiable Matter listed in the foregoing clauses
(a)-(h) of _Section_ __ _ 11.2_.

 

(b) The period during which claims may be initiated (the "Claims Period")
for indemnification from the Escrow Cash shall commence at the Effective Time
and terminate at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the 12 month anniversary of the
Closing Date (the "Escrow Period"). The Claims Period for (A) indemnification
for Damages arising out of or resulting from any Fraud by the Company under
this Agreement shall commence at the Effective Time and terminate upon the
earlier of (1) the six year anniversary of the Closing Date and (2) expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations, (B) indemnification for Damages
arising out of or resulting from any of the matters set forth on _Schedule
11.2(g)_ shall commence at the Effective Time and terminate upon the three
year anniversary of the Closing Date, and (C) indemnification for Damages
arising out of _Section_ __ _ 11.2(b)_ to _(f)_ or breaches of Fundamental
Representations by the Company under this Agreement shall commence at the
Effective Time and terminate upon expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations.

(c) Each Notice of Claim by Parent given pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
11.4_ shall contain the following information:

 



73 (1) that Parent or another Parent Indemnified Person has incurred,
paid, sustained or accrued, or reasonably anticipates that it will incur,
pay, sustain or accrue, Damages in an aggregate stated amount arising from
such Claim (which amount may be the amount of damages claimed by a third party
in an action brought against any Parent Indemnified Person based on alleged
facts, which if true, would give rise to liability for Damages to such Parent
Indemnified Person under this _Article 11_ ); and

 

(2) a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably
available to Parent), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to
such Damages based on Parents good faith belief thereof, including (x) the
basis for such anticipated liability and the nature of the breach to which
such Damages are related, (y) the identity of any third party claimant and
(z) copies of any formal demand or complaint from any third party claimant.

 

(d) No delay on the part of Parent in giving the Representative a Notice of
Claim shall relieve the Representative or any Effective Time Holder from any
of their respective obligations under this _Article 11_ unless (and then only
to the extent that) the Representative or the Effective Time Holders are
materially prejudiced thereby in terms of the amount of Damages for which the
Effective Time Holders are obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Persons.

 

11.5 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) Parent shall determine and conduct the defense and the settlement,
adjustment or compromise of any Third-Party Claim, and the costs and expenses
incurred by Parent in connection with such defense or settlement (including
reasonable attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees and court
or arbitration costs) may be included by Parent in the Damages for which
Parent may seek indemnification pursuant to a Claim made by any Parent
Indemnified Person hereunder.

 

(b) The Representative shall have the right to receive copies of all
pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the Third-Party Claim
(to the extent that receipt of such documents by the Representative does not
affect any privilege relating to the Parent Indemnified Person and subject to
execution by the Representative of Parents standard non-disclosure agreement
to the extent that such materials contain confidential or proprietary
information). The Representative may participate at the expense of the
Effective Time Holders in, but not determine or conduct, any defense of the
Third-Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect to the Third-Party
Claim.

 

(c) No settlement of any such Third-Party Claim with any third party
claimant shall be determinative of the existence or amount of Damages
relating to such matter, except with the written consent of the
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed (it being understood and agreed that it shall be reasonable for
the Representative to withhold consent to any requested settlement if the
Representative believes in good faith that there is not any underlying basis
for indemnification under _Section 11.2_ with respect to such settlement). In
the event that the Representative has consented to any such settlement,
neither the Representative nor any Effective Time Holder shall have any power
or authority to object under any provision of this _Article 11_ to the amount
of any claim by or on behalf of any Parent Indemnified Person against the
Aggregate Escrow Cash for indemnification with respect to such settlement.

 



74 11.6 _Resolution of Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim given
by Parent shall be resolved as follows:

(a) _Uncontested Claims_. If, within 30 days after a Notice of Claim
is received by the Representative, the Representative does not contest such
Notice of Claim in writing to Parent as provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.6(b)_,
the Representative shall be conclusively deemed to have consented, on behalf
of all Effective Time Holders, to the recovery by the Parent Indemnified
Person of the full amount of Damages specified in the Notice of Claim in
accordance with this _Article 11_ , including the forfeiture of Aggregate
Escrow Cash.

 

(b) _Contested Claims_. If the Representative gives Parent written notice
contesting all or any portion of a Notice of Claim (a "Contested Claim")
(with a copy to the Escrow Agent) within the 30 day period specified in
_Section_ __ _ 11.6(a)_, then such Contested Claim shall be resolved by
either (i) a written settlement agreement executed by Parent and the
Representative (a copy of which shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent) or
(ii) in the absence of such a written settlement agreement within 30 days
following receipt by Parent of the written notice from the Representative, by
binding litigation between Parent and the Representative in accordance with
the terms and provisions of _Section_ __ _ 11.6(c)_.

 

(c) _Litigation of Contested Claims_. Either Parent or the Representative
may bring suit in the courts specified in _Section_ __ _ 12.1_ to resolve
the Contested Claim. The decision of the trial court as to the validity and
amount of any claim in such Notice of Claim shall be non-appealable, binding
and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold
payments out of the Aggregate Escrow Cash in accordance therewith. Judgment
upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction.

11.7 _Appointment of Representative_.

 

(a) By voting in favor of the Merger or participating in the conversion of
Company Capital Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants, each Effective
Time Holder approves the designation of and designates the Representative as
the representative of the Effective Time Holders and as the attorney-in-fact
and agent for and on behalf of each Effective Time Holder with respect to
claims for indemnification under this _Article 11_ and the taking by
the Representative of any and all actions and the making of any decisions
required or permitted to be taken by the Representative under this Agreement,
including the exercise of the power to: (a) give and receive notices and
communications to or from Parent (on behalf of itself of any other Parent
Indemnified Person) and/or the Escrow Agent relating to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or any of the transactions and other matters contemplated
hereby or thereby (except to the extent that this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication shall
be given or received by such holders individually); (b) authorize the release
or delivery to Parent of the Aggregate Escrow Cash in satisfaction of
indemnification claims by Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Person
pursuant to this _Article 11_ (including by not objecting to such claims); (c)
agree to, object to, negotiate, resolve, enter 

 



75  into settlements and compromises of, demand litigation of, and comply with
orders of courts with respect to, indemnification claims by Parent or any
other Parent Indemnified Person against the Aggregate Escrow Cash pursuant to
this _Article 11_ ; and (d) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The
Representative shall have authority and power to act on behalf of each
Effective Time Holder with respect to the disposition, settlement or other
handling of all claims against the Aggregate Escrow Cash under this _Article
11_ and all rights or obligations with respect to the Aggregate Escrow Cash
arising under this _Article 11_. The Effective Time Holders shall be bound by
all actions and decisions taken and consents and instructions given by the
Representative in connection with this _Article 11_ , and Parent and other
Parent Indemnified Persons and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on,
and shall be relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by
them in accordance with, any such action, decision, consent or instruction of
the Representative. Notices or communications to or from the Representative
after the Closing shall constitute notice to or from each of the Effective
Time Holders. The Person serving as the Representative may be replaced from
time to time by the holders of a majority in interest of the Aggregate Escrow
Cash then on deposit with the Escrow Agent upon not less than ten days prior
written notice to Parent and the Escrow Agent, which notice shall specify the
Person replacing the Representative, the effective date of such replacement,
the mailing address and telephone number for such Person and other information
reasonably requested by Parent or the Escrow Agent.

 

(b) The Representative will incur no liability of any kind with respect to
any action or omission by the Representative in connection with the
Representatives services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements
ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly resulting from the
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Representative
shall not be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of
counsel. The Effective Time Holders will severally (based on each such
holders Pro Rata Share) and not jointly indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively,
"Representative Expenses") arising out of or in connection with the
Representatives execution and performance of this Agreement and any
agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Expense is
suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event that any such
Representative Expense is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Representative, the
Representative will reimburse the Effective Time Holders the amount of such
indemnified Representative Expense to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the
Representative by the Effective Time Holders, any such Representative
Expenses may be recovered by the Representative from (i) first, the Expense
Cash and (ii) second, the Escrow Cash at such time as any remaining amounts
would otherwise be distributable to the Effective Time Holders; _provided_ ,
that while this _Section_ __ _ 11.7_ allows the Representative to be paid
from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Effective
Time Holders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative
Expenses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the
Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.
In no event will the Representative be required to advance its own funds on
behalf of the Effective Time Holders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability
or indemnification 

 



76  obligations of the Effective Time Holders set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities provided to the
Representative under this  _Section_ __ _ 11.7_. The foregoing indemnities
will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Representative or
the termination of this Agreement. Upon the Closing, the Parent will wire the
Expense Cash to the Representative to be held by it in a segregated client
funds account and which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or
reimbursing the Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this
Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The Effective Time Holders
will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Cash and irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Representative any ownership right that they may
otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Expense Cash other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Representative will
hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use these funds
for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and will not
voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the completion of the
Representatives responsibilities, the Representative will deliver any
remaining balance of the Expense Cash to the Payments Administrator for
further distribution to the Effective Time Holders. For tax purposes, the
Expense Cash will be treated as having been received and voluntarily set
aside by the Effective Time Holders at the time of Closing. For clarity, no
Parent Indemnified Person shall have any liability with respect to the Expense
Cash, including with respect to the distribution, investment, holding and
disposition thereof.

(c) The Representative shall have reasonable access to information about
the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of the Companys
former officers and employees for purposes of performing its duties and
exercising its rights hereunder; _provided, that,_ the Representative shall
treat confidentially and not use or disclose the terms of this Agreement or
any nonpublic information from or about the Surviving Corporation to anyone
(except to the Effective Time Holders or the Representatives employees,
attorneys, accountants, financial advisors or authorized representatives on a
need to know basis, in each case who agree to treat such information
confidentially); _provided, however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to provide such access or information if it
determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would jeopardize the
protection of attorney-client privilege. The Representative shall enter into a
separate customary confidentiality agreement prior to being provided access
to such information if reasonably requested by Parent.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Article 11 to the contrary, unless a
majority-in-interest of the Effective Time Holders (determined using their
respective Pro Rata Shares) shall have notified Parent and the Representative
in writing to the contrary, the Representative shall not be empowered or
authorized to act as agent or attorney-in-fact for or on behalf of the
Effective Time Holders with respect to any indemnification claim to the
extent such claim seeks recovery from the Effective Time Holders directly
(i.e., beyond the Escrow Cash) ("Extended Parent Claim"), meaning that the
grants of authority to the Representative contemplated by _Section 11.7_(a)
shall not be applicable with respect to any such Extended Parent Claim.

 

(e) Certain Effective Time Holders (the "Advisory Group") have concurrently
herewith entered into a letter agreement with the Representative regarding
direction to be provided by the Advisory Group to the Representative. The
Advisory Group shall incur no

 



77  liability to the Effective Time holders for any liability incurred by the
members of the Advisory Group while acting in good faith and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of their duties (it being
understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel
shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith), even if such act or omission
constitutes negligence on the part of the Advisory Group or one of its
members. This indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement.

 

11.8 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The Company Securityholders,
the Representative and Parent agree to treat (and cause their Affiliates to
treat) any payment received pursuant to this _Article 11_ as adjustments to
the Total Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes, to the maximum extent
permitted by Applicable Law.

 

ARTICLE 12

TAX MATTERS

12.1 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Parent, the Company and the
Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by another party, in connection with any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Parent and the Representative agree to (A) retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority and (B) to give the
other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records.

 

12.2 _Returns_. Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely
file, or cause to be timely filed (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained), all Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries required
to be filed after the Closing Date. Returns relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (such Returns, "Pre-Closing Returns") which are filed pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 12.2_ shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior Tax
accounting practices and methods used by the Company and its Subsidiaries,
or, if past practice is inconsistent with Applicable Law, consistent with
Applicable Law. In the event that the Taxes reflected on a Pre-Closing Return
could form the basis for a claim of indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 11.2_, Parent shall provide the Pre-Closing Return to the Representative
for review and comment at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for
filing such Returns, and shall consider in good faith and incorporate any
reasonable comments thereto provided by the Representative.

 

12.3 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any and all Tax sharing, allocation,
indemnification or similar agreements or arrangements with respect to or
involving the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 



78 12.4 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, registration and other
such Taxes (including, without limitation, charges for or in connection with
the recording of any instrument or document as provided in this Agreement)
payable in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by
Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Effective Time Holders. The parties
agree to cooperate with each other in the filing of any Returns with respect
to Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in their
possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such Returns.

 

12.5 _Tax Contests_. Parent shall notify the Representative in writing
upon receipt by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates
of any notice of any written inquiries, assessments, legal proceedings, or
audits received from any Governmental Authority after the Closing with respect
to Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for which could form the basis
for a claim of indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ ("Tax
Contest"). Parent shall have sole control of the conduct of such Tax Contests,
_provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall keep the Representative timely informed
with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such Tax Contest,
provide the Representative with the right to participate in any such Tax
Contest at the Effective Time Holders expense, and shall not settle or
compromise any such Tax Contest without the Representatives prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the
event of any conflict or overlap between the provisions of this  _Section_ __
_ 12.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.5_, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
12.5_ shall control.

 

12.6 _Certain Post-Closing Tax Matters_. Unless required by a
"determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code), none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company) will or will permit or cause any
Person to: (A) file (other than in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 12.2_) or
amend any Return with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries that relates
in whole or in part to any Pre-Closing Tax Period; or (B) make any Tax
election (including any election pursuant to Section 338 of the Code or the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (or pursuant to any corresponding
provision of Applicable Law) with respect to the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement) or change any method of the Tax accounting that has an effect
on any Return relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of any
Pre-Closing Tax Period; in each case except with the prior written consent of
the Representative (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned); _provided_ , _however_ , if Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company) takes any such action without the prior written consent of
Representative, such action shall not be determinative of the existence of any
claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.2_ or otherwise under
this Agreement or the amount of any Damages relating to such claim. Parent
and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation)
shall not make or initiate any voluntary contact with a Governmental Authority
regarding any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case, which could reasonably be
expected to increase the Effective Time Holders indemnification obligations
for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement without consulting with
the Representative in good faith.

 



79 ARTICLE 13

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

13.1 _Governing_ __ _ Law_. The internal laws of the State of Delaware,
irrespective of its conflicts of law principles, shall govern the validity of
this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the interpretation and
enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of first, the state
courts within New York County in the State of New York (and any appellate
court thereof located within such county) and to the extent such state courts
within New York County in the State of New York (or appellate court thereof
located within such county) lacks jurisdiction over the matter, the Federal
courts of the United States of America in the Southern District of New York
(or appellate court thereof located within such county) solely in respect of
the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of
the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including resolution of disputes
under  _Section_ __ _ 11.6(c)_), and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such
action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said
courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement
or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in such court. The parties hereby
consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such
parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 13.9_ or in such other manner as may be
permitted by Applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.
With respect to any particular action, suit or proceeding, venue shall lie
solely in New York, New York.

 

13.2 _Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of Parent, including
any successor to, or assignee of, all or substantially all of the business and
assets of Parent. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, no party
hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of
this provision shall be void.

13.3 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or
unenforceable, then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of the void or unenforceable
provision.

13.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original as regards any party whose
signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute one and
the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or more
counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the
signatures of all parties reflected hereon as signatories.

 



80 13.5 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby
or by law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude
the exercise of any other. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any State having jurisdiction. However, notwithstanding the foregoing,
following the Closing, _Section_ __ _ 11.3(g)_ shall exclusively control
regarding remedies under this Agreement.

 

13.6 _Amendments and Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may
be amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively), only by a writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. The
waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the performance hereof
shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other default or any
succeeding breach or default. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 13.6_ at any time before or after
adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders, but, after such
adoption, no amendment shall be made which by Applicable Law requires the
further approval of the Company Stockholders without obtaining such further
approval. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of Company and
Parent, by action taken by its Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally
allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to it contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions for its benefit contained herein. No such waiver or extension
shall be effective unless signed in writing by the party against whom such
waiver or extension is asserted. The failure of any party to enforce any of

herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Reference to the subsidiaries of an entity shall be deemed to
include all direct and indirect subsidiaries of such entity. The parties
hereto agree that they have been represented by legal counsel during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the
application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document shall be construed against
the party drafting such agreement or document.

 

13.11 _No Joint Venture_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed or construed as creating a joint venture or partnership between any of
the parties hereto. No party is by virtue of this Agreement authorized as an
agent, employee or legal representative of any other party. No party shall

described herein and contemplated hereby and to carry into effect the intents
and purposes of this Agreement.

 

13.13 _Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. No provisions of this Agreement
are intended, nor shall be interpreted, to provide or create any third party
beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind in any client, customer,

party hereto or any other Person unless specifically provided otherwise
herein and, except as so provided, all provisions hereof shall be personal
solely between the parties to this Agreement; except that _Section_ __ _ 6.5_

intended to benefit the Parent Indemnified Persons.

13.14 _Public Announcement_. Upon execution of this Agreement, the Parent
and Company shall issue a joint press release announcing the proposed Merger,
and each of Parent and the Company shall have a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on such press release. Prior to the publication of such
initial press release, neither Parent nor the Company

 



83  shall make any public announcement relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except as may be required by law).
Thereafter, Parent may issue such press releases, and make such other public

any securities exchange or stock market) or otherwise in the best interest of
Parent.

13.15 _Confidentiality_. The Company and Parent each confirm that they
have entered into the NDA and that they are each bound by, and shall abide
by, the provisions of such NDA. If this Agreement is terminated, the NDA shall

hereto, the Company Ancillary Agreements, the Parent Ancillary Agreements and

agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings,

parties with respect hereto other than the NDA. The express terms hereof
control and supersede any course of performance or usage of the trade
inconsistent with any of the terms hereof.

13.17 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

13.18 _Consent to Representation; Conflict of Interest_. If the
Representative so desires, acting on behalf of the Company Securityholders
and without the need for any consent or waiver by Company, Parent, or Sub,
Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian LLP ("Gunderson")
shall be permitted to represent the Company Securityholders after the Closing
in connection with any dispute that arises under this Agreement in connection
with Parent enforcing its indemnification rights under _Article 11_. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Gunderson shall
be permitted to represent the Company Securityholders, or any one or more of
them, in connection with any negotiation or dispute (including any litigation,
arbitration, or other adversary proceeding) with Parent, the Company, or any
of their agents or Affiliates under or relating to this Agreement in
connection with Parent enforcing its indemnification rights under _Article
11_. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company further agree that in connection
with any dispute arising under this Agreement in connection with Parent
enforcing its indemnification rights under _Article 11_ , as to all
communications among Gunderson and the Representative and the
Company Securityholders and their respective Affiliates (individually and
collectively, the "Seller Group") that relate in any way to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and are subject to attorney-client privilege,
attorney 

 



84  work product or similar protections, Parent shall not assert the such
communications against Gunderson or the Seller Group (including as evidence
supporting such claim). Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing the
exception of client confidence shall belong solely to Parent and the Company
as a Subsidiary of Parent and may be controlled only by Parent and the Company
as a Subsidiary of Parent and shall not be retained by the Seller Group. This
right to the attorney-client privilege shall exist even if such communications
may exist on the Companys or Gundersons computer system (or of a third
party) or in documents in the Companys or Gundersons possession (or a third
party). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises
between Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company, on the one hand, and a Person
other than a party to this Agreement, on the other hand, after the
Closing, the Company or Parent may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure to such third-party of confidential communications by
Gunderson to the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , neither Parent nor the
Company may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Representative.
