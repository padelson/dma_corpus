practicable, but in any event within the 10 business day period commencing on
the first business day after the date of this Agreement, Acquisition Sub
shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the

DGCL.

(d) The Offer shall expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the date
that is 20 business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule

initial expiration time and date of the Offer, the " _Initial Expiration
Time_ "), unless the Offer has been extended as provided in this Agreement

the Offer may or shall, as applicable, be extended from time to time as
follows:

 

(i) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, any Offer Condition is not

preceding the End Date, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied; and
(B) to the extent requested by the Company from time to time, Acquisition Sub
shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer and the then-scheduled Expiration Time
for one or more periods (the length of such periods, but in no event longer

later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the business day immediately
preceding the End Date, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied;

(ii) Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required
by applicable Legal Requirements, any interpretation or position of the SEC

Offer;

 

(iii) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, the Company brings or shall
have brought any action in accordance with Section 8.13 to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement by
Parent or Acquisition Sub, the Expiration Time shall be extended: (A) for the
period during which such action is pending; or (B) by such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action, as the case may be, but,
in any event, ending no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the
business day immediately preceding the End Date; or

 

(iv) if: (A) on or after the date that is the second business day prior to the
date on which the then-scheduled Expiration Time will occur the full amount
of the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing in an amount sufficient,
together with any cash on the balance sheet of Parent and any cash on the
balance sheet of the Company, to enable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated) is not reasonably expected to be available to be
funded promptly after the Expiration Time (a " _Financing Delay_ ") and Parent
notifies the Company in writing that a Financing Delay has occurred (such
notice, the " _Financing Delay Notice_ "); (B) all of the Offer Conditions
have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Expiration Time, but subject to such
conditions being able to be satisfied) on the date on which Parent delivers
the Financing Delay Notice to the Company; and (C) only with respect to clause
"(1)" below, Parent and Acquisition Sub irrevocably acknowledge and agree in
a writing delivered to the Company (which writing need only be delivered one
time) that all Offer Conditions set forth in clauses "(2)(b)," "(2)(c),"
"(2)(e)," (2)(g)" (except in such certificate with respect to clause "(2)(d)"
of _Annex I_ ) and "(2)(h)" of _Annex I_ shall be deemed to have been
satisfied or waived at the Expiration Time, then: (1) Acquisition Sub shall
have the right in its sole discretion to extend (and re-extend) the Offer and
the then-scheduled Expiration Time for one or more periods of up to five
business days

 



3  each (each such increment to end at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the
last business day of such period) (the length of such periods, but in no event
longer than five business days each, to be determined by Acquisition Sub), or
such other duration as may be agreed to by Parent and the Company; and (2) to
the extent requested by the Company from time to time, Acquisition Sub shall
extend (and re-extend) the Offer and the then-scheduled Expiration Time for
one or more periods of at least five business days and no more than 10
business days each (each such increment to end at 11:59 p.m., New York City
time, on the last business day of such period); _provided_ , _ however_ ,
that Acquisition Sub shall not (under either clause "(1)" or "(2)" above) be
permitted to extend the Offer to a time and date that is later than 11:59
p.m., New York City time, on the second business day after the End Date.

The Offer may not be terminated prior to the then-scheduled Expiration Time
unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 7.

(e) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Acceptance Time, the
outstanding Company Shares are changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Per Share Amount
shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate.

1.2 Actions of Parent and Acquisition Sub.

 

(a) On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall: (i)
cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer, which will contain or incorporate by reference
Acquisition Subs offer to purchase and related letter of transmittal (the

form of summary advertisement (such Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO and
all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto being referred to
collectively in this Agreement as the " _Offer Documents_ "); and (ii) cause
the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares to the

of Acquisition Subs obligations under this Agreement.

reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Schedule 14D-9.
Parent and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or supplement
thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC or the dissemination thereof
to holders of Company Shares; _provided, however_ , that the Company need not
give Parent and its counsel such opportunity to review and comment in
connection with any amendment or supplement to the Schedule 14D-9 that relates
to any Acquisition Proposal or any Change in Recommendation. The Company shall
promptly provide Parent and its counsel with a copy or a description of any

(b) To the extent required by the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder, (i) each of Parent, Acquisition Sub
and the Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Schedule 14D-9 if such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and (ii) the Company shall take all
steps necessary to promptly cause the Schedule 14D-9, as supplemented or
amended to correct such information, to be filed with the SEC and, subject to
the final sentence of this Section 1.3(b), to be disseminated to holders of
Company Shares. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly furnish to the
Company all information concerning Parent or Acquisition Sub that may be
reasonably requested by the Company in connection with any action contemplated

5  disseminated to the holders of Company Shares together with the Offer
Documents disseminated to the holders of Company Shares.

 

(c) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, except as
permitted by Section 1.3(d) or Section 5.2: (i) withdraw, modify, amend or
qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent and Acquisition Sub, the Company Board
Recommendation; (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable any Acquisition
Proposal; (iii) publicly propose or announce any intention to take any of
the foregoing actions (any action described in clauses "(i)," "(ii)" or
"(iii)" being referred to as a " _Change in Recommendation_ "); or (iv) cause
or permit the Company to enter into any contract (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with Section 5.2(a))
contemplating an Acquisition Transaction (any such contract, an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may:

(i) make a Change in Recommendation in response to an Acquisition Proposal
and/or cause the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
concerning an Acquisition Proposal if: (A) such Acquisition Proposal did not
result from a breach of Section 5.2(a); (B) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor, (1) that such Acquisition Proposal would, if this
Agreement or the Offer were not amended or an alternative transaction with
Parent were not entered into, constitute a Superior Proposal and (2) that in
light of such Acquisition Proposal, a failure to make a Change in
Recommendation and/or to cause the Company to enter into such Alternative
Acquisition Agreement would be a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal
Requirements; (C) the Company delivers to Parent a written notice (the "
_Superior Proposal Notice_ ") stating that the Company Board intends to take
such action and including the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal and the material terms thereof or (in the event the Company Board
contemplates causing the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement) including a copy of such Alternative Acquisition Agreement; (D)
during the four business day period commencing on the date of Parents receipt
of such Superior Proposal Notice, the Company negotiates in good faith with
Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding a possible
amendment of this Agreement or the Offer or a possible alternative transaction
so that the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the Superior Proposal
Notice ceases to be a Superior Proposal; (E) after the expiration of
the negotiation period described in clause "(D)" above, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and its financial advisor, and after taking into account any amendments to
this Agreement and the Offer that Parent and Acquisition Sub have proposed to
make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by clause "(D)" above, that
(1) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (2) the
failure to make a Change in Recommendation and/or enter into such Alternative
Acquisition Agreement would be a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements;
and (F) if the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
concerning such Superior Proposal, the Company terminates this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1(f); _provided_ , _however_ , __ that if such
Superior Proposal is materially modified (it being agreed that any change in
the amount, form or mix of consideration shall constitute a material
modification), the Company shall again comply with its obligations under
clauses "(C)" through "(E)" of this Section 1.3(d)(i) with respect to such
modified Superior Proposal (with the negotiation period in clause "(D)" above
reduced to three business days); or

 



6 (ii) make a Change in Recommendation not related to an Acquisition Proposal
if: (A) any material change in circumstances arises after the date of this
Agreement affecting the Company that does not relate to any Acquisition
Proposal (any such material change in circumstances unrelated to an
Acquisition Proposal being referred to as a " _Change in Circumstances_ "),
_provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall any of the following constitute a
Change in Circumstances: (1) the announcement or pendency of this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or (2) the fact that the Company meets or exceeds internal or
analysts expectations or projections; (B) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light
of such Change in Circumstances, a failure to effect a Change in
Recommendation would be a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements; (C) such Change in Recommendation is not effected prior
to the fourth business day after Parent receives written notice from the
Company confirming that the Company Board intends to effect such Change in
Recommendation, including a description of the Change in Circumstances in
reasonable detail; (D) during such four business day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) to amend this Agreement or the Offer or
enter into an alternative transaction; and (E) at the end of such four
business day period, the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and after taking into account
any amendments to this Agreement and the Offer that Parent and Acquisition
Sub have proposed to make as a result of the negotiations contemplated by
clause "(D)" above, that, in light of such Change in Circumstances, a failure
to effect a Change in Recommendation would be a breach by the Company Board
of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements.

 

(e) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall instruct its transfer
agent to furnish to Acquisition Sub a list, as of the most recent practicable
date, of the record holders of Company Shares and their addresses, as well as
mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of
Company Shares. The Company will furnish Acquisition Sub with such
additional information (including any security position listings as of the
most recent practicable date in the Companys possession and updated lists of
the record holders of Company Shares) and assistance as Acquisition Sub may
reasonably request for purposes of communicating the Offer to the holders of
Company Shares. Except as required by applicable Legal Requirements or as
necessary to communicate the Offer, all information furnished in accordance
with this Section 1.3(e) shall be held in confidence by Parent and
Acquisition Sub in accordance with the requirements of the Mutual
Confidentiality Agreement, dated April 1, 2016, between Parent and the
Company, as amended (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and shall be used
by Parent and Acquisition Sub only in connection with the communication of the
Offer to the holders of Company Shares.

conducted and all such Governmental Authorizations are valid, and in full
force and effect. To the knowledge of the Company, no such Governmental
Authorization has been or is being revoked or challenged, except where such
revocation or challenge would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and, to the knowledge of the Company, the Collaboration Partners
(with respect to the Company Products) have filed with the applicable

reports or submissions, including adverse event reports and all other
submitted data relating to the Company Products required to be filed by them
to permit the conduct of the Companys business as currently conducted. All
such filings, representations, declarations, listings, registrations, reports
or submissions were in material compliance with applicable Legal Requirements
when filed, and no material deficiencies have been asserted by any applicable
Governmental Entity with respect to any such filings, representations,
declarations, listing, registrations, reports or submissions.

similar remedy. The Company is not the subject of any pending or, to the

the subject of a refusal to file, clinical hold, deficiency or similar action

request the recall, suspension or discontinuation of, any Company Product.

knowledge of Parent and Acquisition Sub, each of the other parties thereto;
(ii) the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in
any respect and no such amendment or modification is contemplated or pending
(other than amendments or modifications to the Debt Commitment Letter solely
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar
entities); and (iii) the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letter
have not been withdrawn, terminated, reduced or rescinded in any respect and
no such withdrawal, termination, reduction or rescission is contemplated by
Parent or Acquisition Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent or Acquisition Sub,
any of the other parties thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has
paid in full any and all fees (including commitment fees and other fees)
required to be paid under the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on or
prior to the date of this Agreement, and Parent is unaware of any fact or
occurrence existing on the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate or that would reasonably be expected
to cause the Debt Commitment Letter to be ineffective. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies (including
pursuant to any "flex" provisions in the Fee Letter or otherwise) related to
the funding of the full amount (or any portion) of the Debt Financing except
as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which (with or
without notice, lapse of time or both) would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach or failure to satisfy a condition precedent by
Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or, to the
knowledge of Parent or Acquisition Sub, any other party thereto under the
Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor
Acquisition Sub has any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on
a timely basis any of the conditions that are required to be satisfied by it
as a condition to the obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter prior to
the expiration thereof, or that the full amount of the Debt Financing will not
be available in full to Parent and Acquisition Sub at the Acceptance Time and
the Effective Time, nor does Parent or Acquisition Sub have knowledge or
reason to believe that any of the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter
will not perform their respective obligations thereunder.

 

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions and that the Debt
Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, the net
proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter together with any cash on
the balance sheet of Parent and any cash on the balance sheet of the Company,
will, in the aggregate, be sufficient for Parent and Acquisition Sub to
pay all of the cash amounts (including any fees and expenses) required to be
paid by Parent or Acquisition Sub at the Acceptance Time and the Effective
Time in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



27 4.7 Solvency. Assuming the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section 3
and, subject to Section 4.12, that the most recent financial forecasts of the
Company made available to Parent were prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions that were, at the time made, and continue to be, at the Effective
Time, reasonable, immediately after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer, the Merger and the Debt
Financing, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter, the payment of any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the payment of all related fees and expenses of Parent and
Acquisition Sub, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent
as of the Acceptance Time and as of the Effective Time and immediately after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ ," when used with respect to
any Person, means that, as of any date of determination: (a) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed the sum of: (i) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including
contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors; and (ii)
the amount that will be required to pay the liabilities of such Person, as of
such date, on its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities)
as such debts become absolute and mature; (b) such Person will not have, as
of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such
date; and (c) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities (including
contingent and other liabilities) as they mature. For purposes of this
definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities (including contingent and other liabilities)
as they mature" means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash
from operations, asset dispositions or refinancings, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

4.8 Ownership of Company Shares. Neither Parent nor any of Parents
Affiliates directly or indirectly owns, and during the past three years,
neither Parent nor any of Parents Affiliates has owned, beneficially or
otherwise, any Company Shares or any securities, contracts or
obligations convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Company
Shares.

4.9 Offer Documents. The Offer Documents will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act. On the date filed
with the SEC, on the date first published, sent or given to the Companys
stockholders and at all other times at or prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Offer Documents will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation is made by
Parent or Acquisition Sub with respect to any information supplied in writing
by the Company specifically for inclusion in the Offer Documents.

 

4.10 Information in Schedule 14D-9. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 will,
at the time the Schedule 14D-9 is filed with the SEC, at the time the Schedule
14D-9 is mailed to the stockholders of the Company, or at any other time at
or prior to the Acceptance Time, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

4.11 No Other Company Representations or Warranties. Each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub acknowledges and agrees that: (a) the Company has not made and
is not making any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the
subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied, except as provided in
Section 3; (b) neither of them are relying, and have not relied, on any
representations or

 



28  warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement,
express or implied, except as provided in Section 3; and (c) no employee,
agent, advisor or other Representative of the Company has made or is making
any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and Acquisition
Sub acknowledges and agrees that: (i) neither the Company nor any of its
Representatives has made any representation or warranty, whether express or
implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding the
Company or its Affiliates furnished or made available to Parent or Acquisition
Sub and their respective Representatives except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement; and (ii) neither the Company nor any other Person shall be
subject to any liability to Parent or Acquisition Sub or any other Person
resulting from the Companys making available to Parent or Acquisition Sub or
Parents or Acquisition Subs use of such information, or any information,
documents or material made available to Parent or Acquisition Sub in any due
diligence materials provided to Parent or Acquisition Sub, including in the
"data room," management presentations (formal or informal) or in any other
form in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

4.12 Non-Reliance on Company Forecasts, Projections, Estimates, Budgets and
Forward-Looking Statements. Without limiting Section 4.11, each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub acknowledges and agrees that the Company has not made and is
not making any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding any
forecasts, projections, estimates or budgets discussed with, delivered to or
made available to Parent or to any of its Representatives, or otherwise
regarding the future revenues, future results of operations (or any component
thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or any
component thereof) of the Company or the future business and operations of
the Company.

(iv) waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce any contractual standstill or
similar obligation of any Person (other than Parent and Acquisition Sub);

_provided, however,_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may engage in any such
discussions or negotiations and provide any such information in response to a
bona-fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.2(a) if: (A) prior to providing any material non-public
information regarding the

 



31  Company to any third party in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the
Company receives from such third party (or there is then in effect with such
party) an executed confidentiality agreement that contains nondisclosure
provisions that are not materially less restrictive of such third party than
the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not contain any standstill provision); (B) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal; and (C) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure
to take such action would be a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements.
Prior to or concurrent with providing any material non-public information to
such third party, the Company shall make such material non-public information
available to Parent (to the extent such material non-public information has
not been previously made available by the Company to Parent or Parents
Representatives).

 

(b) If the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry,
then the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 48 hours after
receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry) notify Parent in
writing of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (which
notification shall include the identity of the Person making or submitting
such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and the material terms and
conditions thereof), and shall thereafter keep Parent reasonably and promptly
informed of the status of and any material change to the terms of such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry; ___provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not be required to provide Parent or Acquisition Sub with
the identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry or the terms or conditions of any such Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry to the extent that: (i) disclosure of such
information is prohibited by any confidentiality agreement in effect as of the
date of this Agreement; and (ii) the only communications between the Company
or any of its Representatives and such Person relate to: (A) such Person being
informed of the Companys obligations under Section 5.2; and (B) a request
that such Person waive any provision of such confidentiality agreement that
prohibits the Company from complying with the terms of this Section 5.2.

(c) The Company shall, and shall ensure that its Representatives, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation of, or discussions
or negotiations with, any Person relating to any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry and request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished or provided to such Person.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company, the Company Board or their Representatives from:
(i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A, or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position under
Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, provided that any such
disclosure does not contain an express Change in Recommendation; (ii)
disclosing to the Companys stockholders any factual information regarding the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or the
fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity of the party
making such Acquisition Proposal or the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal (and no such disclosure shall, taken by itself, be deemed to be a
Change in Recommendation); or (iii) furnishing a copy or excerpts of this
Agreement to any Person (or the Representatives of such Person) that makes any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry or communicating with such Person
to the extent necessary to direct such Person to the provisions of this
Section 5.2; _provided, however_ , that the Company Board shall not make any
express Change in Recommendation except in accordance with Section 1.3(d).

 



32 5.3 Filings; Other Action.

 

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall: (i) promptly (and
in no event later than the date that is 10 business days after the date of
this Agreement) make and effect all registrations, filings and submissions
(other than the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9) required to be made or
effected by it pursuant to the HSR Act, the Exchange Act and other
applicable Legal Requirements with respect to the Offer and the Merger; (ii)
use reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents and approvals required from
third parties in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including requesting early termination of the waiting period under
the HSR Act); and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken, on a
timely basis, all other actions necessary or appropriate for the purpose of
consummating and effectuating the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee (except for customary
fees to Governmental Entities), penalty or other consideration to any
Person for any consent or approval required for the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
(A) shall promptly provide all information requested by any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B) shall use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all actions
and steps necessary to obtain any clearance or approval required to be
obtained from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of
Justice, any state attorney general, any foreign competition authority or any
other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any applicable Antitrust Law, Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall: (i) vigorously contest, resist and defend against any such Legal
Proceeding; and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any Order resulting from any such Legal Proceeding.

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in Section 5.3(a),
subject to applicable Legal Requirements, each party hereto shall: (i) give
the other parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding by or before any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Offer or the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties
informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or Legal Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any
communication to or from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S.
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Offer or
the Merger. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the
other parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties
in connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding. In addition,
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Legal
Requirement, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or Legal Proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized
Representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting or
conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal
Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with
any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental
Entity in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or
Legal Proceeding.

 

5.4 Access. Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall afford Parents
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout
the period prior to the Effective Time, to the Companys books and records
and, during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent all
readily available information concerning its business as Parent may
reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to permit any inspection or other access, or to disclose

 



33  any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would: (a)
result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties; (b) violate
any obligation of the Company with respect to confidentiality or privacy; (c)
jeopardize protections afforded the Company under the attorney-client
privilege or the attorney work product doctrine (it being understood that with
respect to any such access or disclosure, the Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent to enable Parent and/or its Representatives to enter
into appropriate confidentiality, joint defense or similar agreements, if and
as applicable, so that Parent and its Representatives may have access to
such information without jeopardizing the protections afforded under the
attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine ); (d) violate
any Legal Requirement; or (e) materially interfere with the conduct of the
Companys business. All information obtained by Parent and its
Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be treated as "Confidential
Information" of the Company for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

5.5 Interim Operations of Acquisition Sub. During the period from the date of
this Agreement through the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of
termination of this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall not engage in any
activities of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

5.6 Publicity. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be a
joint press release issued by the Company and Parent. Thereafter, provided
that the Company Board shall not have made a Change in Recommendation, the
Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall each consult with the other prior to
issuing any press releases or otherwise making public statements with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any
filings with any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) a
party may, without complying with the foregoing obligations, make any public
statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or
those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees
and make disclosures in Company SEC Documents, to the extent that such
statements are consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made jointly by the parties and otherwise in compliance with
this Section 5.6; (b) a party may, without complying with the foregoing
obligations, issue any such press release or make any such public announcement
or statement where such party shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that such disclosure is required
by applicable Legal Requirements or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer
quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Entity; (c)
the Company need not comply with the foregoing obligations in connection with
any press release, public statement or filing to be issued or made with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal (including any "stop, look and listen"
release) or Change in Recommendation; and (d) a party may, without complying
with the foregoing obligations, issue any such press release or make any such
public announcement or statement in connection with any dispute between the
parties hereto regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In addition, the parties shall coordinate with each other and
the others Representatives with respect to communications with employees of
the Company regarding post-Closing transition, integration and related
matters; _provided, however_ , that any such communications shall be conducted
at a reasonable time, jointly and under the supervision of personnel of the
Company and conducted in such a manner as to not interfere unreasonably with
the normal operation of the business of the Company.

5.7 Stock Options; RSUs; ESPP.

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, each (i) Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time
and (ii) Company RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time shall fully vest and shall be cancelled and upon the
cancellation thereof the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, in
respect of each Company Share subject to such Company Option or Company RSU
immediately prior to such cancellation, an

 



34  amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to: (A) the
Per Share Amount; _minus_ (B) with respect to a Company Option only, the
exercise price per Company Share subject to such Company Option; _provided,
however,_ that, if any such Company Option is an Underwater Option, then such
Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash or other consideration
being paid or provided in respect thereof. Each holder of a Company Option or
Company RSU cancelled as provided in this Section 5.7(a) shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the cash
consideration specified in this Section 5.7(a), without interest,
as applicable. Parent shall cause the cash payments described in this Section
5.7(a) to be paid promptly (but no later than the second payroll period)
following the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
(or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take or cause to be taken all
actions necessary to effectuate this Section 5.7(a) to the extent such
treatment is not expressly provided for by the terms of the applicable Company
Equity Plans and related award agreements.

(b) The Company shall take the necessary actions with respect to the Companys
2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") so that: (i) as of
the date of this Agreement, the current offering will be terminated, no
offering periods or purchase periods shall be commenced, and no payroll
deductions or other contributions will be accepted; (ii) no additional
Company Shares shall be purchased or issued under the Company ESPP; and (iii)
conditional upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, the Company ESPP shall
terminate effective upon the Effective Time.

 

5.8 Other Employee Benefits.

 

(a) Parent agrees that all employees of the Company who continue employment
with Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time ("
_Continuing Employees_ ") shall, following the Effective Time: (i) be entitled
to receive base pay, bonus and commission targets, severance and other
benefits substantially similar to those in place with respect to similarly
situated employees of Parent; and (ii) be eligible to participate in Parents
employee benefit plans (including any profit sharing plans, bonus plans,
severance plans and health and welfare benefit plans) to the same extent
as similarly situated employees of Parent. Nothing contained herein shall be
construed as requiring, and the Company shall take no action that would have
the effect of requiring, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
specific employee benefit plans or to continue the employment of any specific
person.

(b) Parent shall ensure that, as of the Effective Time, each Continuing
Employee receives full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to
participate, vesting, benefit accrual, vacation entitlement and severance
benefits) for service with the Company (or predecessor employers to the extent
the Company provides such past service credit) under the comparable employee
benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable and to the extent allowed under such plan, program or policy, in
which such employees became participants; _provided, however_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan or to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, credit to Continuing Employees the amount
of vacation time that such employees had accrued under any applicable Company
Plan as of the Effective Time. With respect to each health or welfare benefit
plan maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation for the benefit of
Continuing Employees, Parent shall, to the extent allowed under such plan: (i)
cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of
insurability requirements and the application of any pre-existing condition
limitations under such plan; and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be
given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee
under any similar Company Plan for the plan year that includes the Effective
Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 



35 (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume and honor in
accordance with their terms all deferred compensation plans, agreements and
arrangements, severance and separation pay plans, agreements and arrangements,
and all written employment, severance, retention, incentive, change in control
and termination agreements (including any change in control provisions
therein) applicable to employees of the Company.

(d) If directed by Parent in writing at least 10 business days prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Plans
intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than
the business day immediately preceding the Acceptance Time. In the event that
Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated
pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board (the form and substance of which
shall be subject to review and reasonable approval by Parent).

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.8 or elsewhere in this Agreement is intended
nor shall be construed to (i) be treated as an amendment to any particular
Company Plan, (ii) prevent Parent from amending or terminating any of its
benefit plans in accordance their terms, (iii) create a right in any employee
to employment with Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or (iv) create any
third-party beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company with respect to
the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may
be provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent or the Company or under any
benefit plan which Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation may
maintain.

 

5.9 Compensation Arrangements. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the compensation
committee of the Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") will cause
each Company Plan and Company employment agreement pursuant to which
consideration is payable to any officer, director or employee who is a holder
of any security of the Company to be approved by the Compensation Committee
(comprised solely of "independent directors") in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in
Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 

5.10 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance.

 

(a) From and after the Acceptance Time, Parent will cause the Company, and the
Surviving Corporation, to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations
of the Company pursuant to (i) each written indemnification agreement in
effect between the Company and any Indemnified Party in effect on the date of
this Agreement and set forth on Part 5.10(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, and (ii) any indemnification, exculpation from liability or
advancement of expenses provision set forth in the Organizational Documents of
the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement. The
Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation shall contain the
provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation from liability and
advancement of expenses set forth in the Companys Organizational Documents on
the date of this Agreement and, from and after the Acceptance Time through
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, such provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that could adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party. 

(b) From the Acceptance Time through the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect, for the benefit of the
Indemnified Parties, the current level and scope of directors and officers
liability insurance coverage as set forth in the Companys current directors
and officers liability insurance policies in effect as of the date of this
Agreement; _provided,_

 



36   _however_ , that (i) in no event shall Parent be required pursuant to this
Section 5.10(b) to expend in any one year an amount in excess of 300% of the
annual premium payable by the Company as of the date of this Agreement with
respect to such current policy, it being understood that if the annual
premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent shall
be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for an
annual premium equal to such amount, and (ii) in lieu of the foregoing, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in clause "(i)" above, the
Company may obtain a prepaid "tail" policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ") prior to
the Acceptance Time, which policy provides the Indemnified Parties with
directors and officers liability insurance for a period ending no earlier
than the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time. Parent shall cause any such
Tail Policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and
cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

 

(c) In the event the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, or at Parents option, Parent, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

 

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this Section 5.10 shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified
Party may have under the Organizational Documents of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, under any other indemnification arrangement, under the
DGCL or otherwise. This Section 5.10 shall survive the Acceptance Time and
shall also survive consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time. This
Section 5.10 is intended to benefit, and may be enforced by, the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs, Representatives, successors and assigns,
and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation. Section 5.10 may not be amended, altered or repealed
after the Acceptance Time without the prior written consent of the affected
Indemnified Person.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, each individual who is or was an officer
or director of the Company at or at or at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time shall be deemed to be an " _Indemnified Party_."

5.11 Section 16 Matters. The Company Board shall, to the extent necessary,
take appropriate action, prior to or as of the Acceptance Time, to approve,
for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the disposition of Company
Shares in the Offer and the deemed disposition and cancellation of Company
Shares and, as applicable, Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Shares
purchased pursuant to the exercise of outstanding purchase rights under the
Company ESPP in the Merger by applicable individuals. 

5.12 Stock Exchange Delisting. The Surviving Corporation shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Shares to no longer be quoted on
NASDAQ and to be deregistered under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time.

 

5.13 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall provide Parent with prompt
notice of, and copies of all pleadings and correspondence relating to, any
Legal Proceeding against the Company or any of its directors or officers by
any holder of Company Shares arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement, or
compromise of any such Legal Proceeding, at Parents sole cost and expense,
and no such settlement or compromise shall be agreed to without the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, _provided_ , _however_ ,

 



37  that Parent shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement that does
not include a full release of Parent and its Affiliates or that imposes an
equitable remedy upon Parent or its Affiliates (including, after the
Effective Time, the Company). For purposes of this Section 5.13, "
_participate_ " means that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed strategy
and other significant decisions with respect to the Legal Proceeding by the
Company (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company
and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer
comments or suggestions with respect to the Legal Proceeding but will not be
afforded any decision-making power or other authority over the Legal
Proceeding except for the settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

 

5.14 Financing Assistance.

 

(a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, use reasonable best
efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, which reasonable best
efforts shall include:

 

(i) furnishing Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable with financial
information and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent such information exists (or is otherwise customary

information would be unreasonably burdensome) and is reasonably requested by
Parent to consummate the Debt Financing (including the Required Financial
Information);

 

(ii) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions, meetings with prospective lenders and
sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Debt Financing, and

the extent necessary, an additional bank information memorandum that does not
include material non-public information) and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing;

 

(iii) (A) reasonably assisting Parent in connection with Parents preparation
of one or more credit or other similar agreements, as well as any pledge and
security documents, and other definitive financing documents, collateral
filings or other certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no perfected security interest, pledge or
guarantee shall be effective until the Effective Time and (B) reasonably
facilitating the taking of all corporate (or equivalent) actions by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to entering such definitive
financing documents and necessary to permit consummation of the Debt
Financing; and

 

(iv) at least four business days prior to the Acceptance Time, providing all
documentation and other information about the Company that is reasonably
requested by the Lenders as the Lenders reasonably determine is required by
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act, to the extent requested by Parent
in writing at least nine business days prior to the Acceptance Time;

_provided_ ; _however_ , in each case that: (A) none of the Company or its
Representatives shall be required to execute or enter into, perform or
authorize any agreement or deliver any guaranty, mortgage, collateral filing,
blocked account control agreement, certificate, document or other instrument,
in each case the effectiveness of which is not contingent upon the Effective
Time or that would otherwise be effective prior to the Effective Time; (B)
such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the 

 



38  business or the ongoing operations of the Company; (C) nothing in this
Section 5.14 shall require cooperation to the extent that it could: (1) cause
any Offer Condition not to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this
Agreement; or (2) reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate the
Companys Organizational Documents or any Legal Requirement, or result in the
contravention of, or result in a violation or breach of, or default under,
any Material Contract; (D) prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company
nor any of its Representatives shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or incur any other liability or obligation in connection
with the financings contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, other than
expenses that are advanced or reimbursed as provided in Section 5.14(c); and
(E) nothing shall obligate the Company or any of its Representatives to: (1)
provide, or cause to be provided, any legal opinion; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company or its Representatives shall use their reasonable best
efforts to provide, or cause to be provided, customary backup documentation
for legal opinions that are required in connection with the Debt Financing to
the extent reasonably requested by Parent in accordance with this Section
5.14(a); or (2) take any action or provide any information to the extent it
would result in a violation of applicable Legal Requirements. 

(b) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
solely for the purpose of obtaining the Debt Financing; _provided_ that such
logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely
to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation
or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective intellectual property rights.

(c) Neither the Company nor its Representatives shall be required to take any
action that would subject any of them to bear any cost or expense or to pay
any commitment or other similar fee or make any other payment or incur any
other liability or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection
with the Debt Financing or the performance of their respective obligations
under this Section 5.14, except to the extent contingent upon the Effective
Time and except in the case of costs, expenses or fees, if such amounts are
advanced or reimbursed as provided in this Section 5.14(c). Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Company
and its Representatives from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse
each of them for, any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with the Debt Financing and the performance of their
respective obligations under this Section 5.14 and any information utilized
in connection therewith, except to the extent such liabilities or obligations
resulted from: (i) information provided by or on behalf of the Company or any
of its Representatives; or (ii) the gross negligence or bad faith of, or
willful misconduct by, the Company. Parent shall, within 30 days after the
delivery of a written request by the Company accompanied by supporting
documentation therefor, reimburse the Company and each of its Representatives
for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
by the Company or any of its Representatives in connection with any assistance
or cooperation in connection with the Debt Financing provided by the Company
or its Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.14.

5.15 Parent Financing Efforts.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain, or cause to be obtained, the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using
its reasonable best efforts with respect to: (i) maintaining in full force and
effect the Debt Commitment Letter; (ii) negotiating, executing and delivering
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing consistent with the
terms and conditions contained therein or, if available, on other terms that
are acceptable to Parent in its sole discretion and could not adversely
affect the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein; and (iii) taking into account the expected timing of the
Marketing Period, satisfying on a timely basis all 

 



39  conditions applicable to Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective
Subsidiaries to obtaining the Debt Financing that are within Parents,
Acquisition Subs or such Subsidiaries control.

(b) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall, without the prior written
consent of the Company: (i) terminate the Debt Commitment Letter, unless the
Debt Commitment Letter is concurrently replaced in a manner consistent with
the following clause (ii); or (ii) permit any amendment, supplement or
modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, or replace,
the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment, supplement, modification,
waiver, or replacement: (w) would: (1) add any new condition to the Debt
Financing (or adversely modify or expand any existing condition); or (2)
taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period, reasonably
be expected to make the timely funding of any of the Debt Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining any of the Debt Financing less
likely to occur; (x) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to an
amount such that the transactions contemplated hereby (including payment of
the Per Share Amount and any other amounts (including fees and expenses)
required to be paid by Parent or Acquisition Sub hereunder) could not be
consummated; (y) taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing
Period, would reasonably be expected to prevent, impair, impede or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or (z) would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely impact the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter (it being
understood that Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had
not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof). Parent shall
deliver to the Company an accurate and complete copy of any amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver of the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreement with respect to the Debt Financing promptly following
execution thereof, in each case, to the extent entered into prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amendment to the Fee Letter
may be redacted to the same extent as the Fee Letter is permitted to be
redacted under Section 4.6(a). Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing: (A) of any material breach or default (or any event or circumstance
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any material breach or default) by any party to the
Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement in connection with the
Debt Financing of which Parent obtains knowledge; (B) of the receipt by
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives of any written notice or other written communication from any
Lender or other financing source with respect to any actual, threatened or
alleged breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letter or any definitive financing agreement in connection with
the Debt Financing or any provision of the Debt Financing contemplated
pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter or such definitive financing agreement
(including any proposal by any Lender or other financing source to
withdraw, terminate or make a material change in the amount of Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter); (C) if for any reason Parent or
Acquisition Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement
with respect to the Debt Financing; and (D) of the termination or expiration
prior to the Acceptance Time of the Debt Commitment Letter. As soon as
reasonably practicable, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall provide any material
information in connection with funding of the Debt Financing reasonably
requested by the Company.

 

(c) Upon the request of the Company, Parent shall promptly update the Company
in reasonable detail of any material developments concerning the availability
of the Debt Financing. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall provide the Company,
upon request, with copies of any drafts of the definitive agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing and such other information and documentation
regarding the Debt Financing as shall be reasonably necessary to allow the
Company to monitor the progress of the arrangement and obtaining of the Debt
Financing. In the event that all or any portion of the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent
shall: (i)

 



40  promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and, to the knowledge of
Parent, the reason therefor; and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event and
in any event no later than the last day of the Marketing Period, alternative
financing (in an amount sufficient to enable the transactions contemplated
hereby to be consummated, including payment of the Per Share Amount and any
other amounts (including fees and expenses) required to be paid by Parent or
Acquisition Sub hereunder) from the same or other financing sources and on
terms and conditions no less favorable in any respect to Parent
or Acquisition Sub than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
compliance by Parent and Acquisition Sub with their obligations under this
Section 5.15 shall not relieve Parent and Acquisition Sub of their obligations
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Nothing contained in this Section 5.15 shall require, and in no event shall
the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require,
Parent to: (A) pay any fees to the Lenders in excess of those contemplated in
the Debt Commitment Letter and the related Fee Letter as of the date hereof,
whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise; or
(B) amend or waive any of the terms or conditions under the Debt Commitment
Letter.

 

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that, as of the date of this Agreement, it
has received: (i) all of the Required Financial Information specified in
clause "(a)" of the definition of such term; and (ii) the unaudited balance
sheet and statement of income of the Company as of and for the fiscal quarter
ended March 31, 2016.

 

5.16 Cash Management. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company will: (a) use
commercially reasonable efforts to convert not less than $50,000,000 of
Short-term Investments to cash; (b) take all action necessary to cause Short-
term Investments that mature after the date of this Agreement to remain in
cash and not be re-invested in Short-term Investments; and (c) discuss with
Parent, and act in good faith in connection with, the conversion of the
Companys remaining Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments into
cash. Any available cash of the Company on hand at the Closing may be used
for payments to be made at the Closing as directed by Parent.

SECTION 6 CONDITIONS TO EACH PARTYS OBLIGATION TO EFFECT THE MERGER

 

The obligation of each party to effect the Merger shall be subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions prior to the Effective
Time:

6.1 Consummation of the Offer. Acquisition Sub (or Parent on Acquisition Subs
behalf) shall have accepted for payment the Company Shares validly tendered
pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn.

6.2 No Restraints. No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other Order preventing the consummation of the Merger shall have
been issued by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction and remain in
effect, and there shall not be any Legal Requirement enacted or deemed
applicable to the Merger that makes consummation of the Merger illegal.

SECTION 7 TERMINATION

7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and the Merger
may be abandoned: 

 



41 (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time;

(b) by Parent or the Company at any time after September 30, 2016 (the " _End
Date_ ") and prior to the Acceptance Time if the Acceptance Time shall not
have occurred on or before the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) if
the Marketing Period has commenced and is continuing, but the Acceptance Time
has not yet occurred as of the End Date, then the End Date shall
automatically be extended to (and shall be deemed for all purposes to be) the
date that is five business days following the then-scheduled end date of the
Marketing Period; and (ii) a party shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) if the breach by such party of any
of its representations or warranties or the failure of such party (or any
Affiliate of such party) to perform any covenant (other than any covenant
related to the Debt Financing) required to be performed by such party (or any
Affiliate of such party) at or prior to the Acceptance Time shall have been
the primary cause of the failure of the Acceptance Time to have occurred on or
before the End Date; 

(c) by Parent or the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if there
shall be any law enacted after the date of this Agreement and remaining in
effect that makes the acceptance for payment of, or the payment for, Company
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer or the Merger illegal or that prohibits
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or any court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree
or ruling having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the acceptance for payment of, or payment for, Company Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger,
and such order, decree or ruling shall have become final and non-appealable;
_provided, however,_ that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) if the failure of such party (or
any Affiliate of such party) to perform any covenant required to be performed
by such party (or any Affiliate of such party) at or prior to the Acceptance
Time shall have been the primary cause of the existence of such order, decree
or ruling;

(d) by Parent or the Company if the Offer (as it may have been extended
pursuant to Section 1.1(d)) expires as a result of the non-satisfaction of
one or more Offer Conditions (it being understood that if any of such Offer
Conditions is deemed satisfied or waived, there cannot be a failure of such
Offer Condition to be satisfied), or is validly terminated or withdrawn prior
to the Acceptance Time in accordance with this Agreement, without Acquisition
Sub having accepted for payment any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the
Offer; _provided, however_ , that a party shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(d) if the non-satisfaction of any
Offer Condition or the termination or withdrawal of the Offer results from the
breach by such party of a representation or warranty under this Agreement or
the failure of such party (or any Affiliate of such party) to perform any
covenant required to be performed by such party (or any Affiliate of such
party) at or prior to the Acceptance Time;

 

(e) by Parent at any time prior to the Acceptance Time (i) if the Company
Board shall have made a Change in Recommendation; or (ii) if, following the
public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal or the commencement of a tender
offer or exchange offer for the Company Shares (or any material change thereto
is first made public or sent or given to the stockholders of the Company),
the Company Board shall have failed to publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation and recommend that the Companys stockholders reject such
tender or exchange offer, as applicable, in each case upon Parents
written request within 10 business days after receipt of such request;
_provided, however_ that Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) unless the notice of termination
pursuant to this Section 7.1(e) is delivered by Parent to the Company within
10 business days following the occurrence of the event giving rise to Parents
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(e);

 



42 (f) by the Company in connection with the Company Board making a Change in
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or causing the Company to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, if the Company and the
Company Board shall have complied in all material respects with the notice,
negotiation and other requirements set forth in Section 1.3(d) with respect
to such Superior Proposal;

(g) by Parent by written notice to the Company at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, if a breach of any representation or warranty in Section 3 or
failure to perform any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on
the part of the Company shall have occurred that would cause a failure of
the conditions set forth in clauses "(2)(b)," "(2)(c)" and "(2)(d)" of _Annex
I_ to exist (it being understood that if any of such conditions is deemed
satisfied or waived, there cannot be a failure of such condition to exist);
_provided, however_ , that, for purposes of this Section 7.1(g), if such a
breach is curable by the Company within 20 business days of the date Parent
gives the Company notice of such breach and the Company is continuing to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach, then Parent may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(g) on account of such breach
unless such breach shall remain uncured upon the expiration of such 20
business day period;

(h) by the Company by written notice to Parent at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, if a breach in any material respect of any representation or
warranty in Section 4 or failure to perform in any material respect any
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement on the part of Parent or
Acquisition Sub shall have occurred, in each case if such breach or failure
has had or would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or Acquisition Sub
from consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that, for purposes of this Section 7.1(h), if such a breach is
curable by Parent within 20 business days of the date the Company gives Parent
notice of such breach and Parent is continuing to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such breach, then the Company may not terminate
this Agreement under this Section 7.1(h) on account of such breach unless
such breach shall remain uncured upon the expiration of such 20 business day
period;

 

(i) by the Company by written notice to Parent at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time, if Acquisition Sub fails to commence the Offer on or prior
to the date that is two business days after the date on which Acquisition Sub
is required to commence the Offer pursuant to Section 1.1(a); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(i) if such failure by Acquisition
Sub results from the failure by the Company (or its Affiliates) to perform any
covenant required to be performed by the Company (or its Affiliates) under
this Agreement; or 

(j) by the Company by written notice to Parent at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time and after the Last Date if: (i) the Offer Conditions have
been satisfied or waived (or, pursuant to Section 1.1(d)(iv), deemed satisfied
or waived) at the earlier of the Expiration Time and the date on which Parent
delivers a Financing Delay Notice (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Expiration Time, but subject to such
conditions being able to be satisfied); and (ii) the Company has confirmed by
written notice to Parent that it intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 7.1(j) if Acquisition Sub fails to consummate (as defined in
Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the Offer when required in accordance Section
1.1(b); and (iii) Acquisition Sub shall have failed to consummate (as defined
in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the Offer within the later of (x) three

contemplated by clause "(ii)" of this Section 7.1(j) and (y) one business day
after the then-scheduled Expiration Time at the time the Company provides the
notice contemplated by clause "(ii)" of this Section 7.1(j) (such later date,
the " _Last Date_ ").

 

7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect, without any liability on the part of any

 



43  party hereto; _provided, however,_ that: (a) the indemnification and
reimbursement obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub under Section 5.14(c),
this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Section 8 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) subject to
Section 7.3(e), the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any party
from any liability for any intentional and material breach of this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Acquisition Sub
acknowledge and agree that any failure of Parent or Acquisition Sub to satisfy
its obligation to accept for payment or pay for Company Shares in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement following satisfaction of the Offer
Conditions, and any failure of Parent to cause the Merger to be effected in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement following satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Section 6, will be deemed to constitute an
intentional and material breach of a covenant of this Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall not be affected by a termination of this
Agreement.

 

7.3 Termination Fee.

 

(a) If: (i) (A) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(d), (B) following the date of this
Agreement and prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced (and such Acquisition
Proposal shall not have been withdrawn prior to the time of the termination
of this Agreement), and (C) the Company consummates a Specified Acquisition
Transaction within 12 months after such termination or the Company enters into
a definitive agreement within 12 months after such termination providing for
a Specified Acquisition Transaction that is subsequently consummated; (ii)
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(e); or (iii)
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(f), then
in the case of each of clauses "(i)" through "(iii)," the Company shall pay
or cause to be paid to Parent, in cash at the time specified in the next
sentence, a termination fee in the amount of $16,500,000 (the " _Company
Termination Fee_ "). Any Company Termination Fee shall be paid by the
Company: (1) in the case of clause "(i)" of the preceding sentence of this
Section 7.3(a), within two business days after the consummation of the
Specified Acquisition Transaction; (2) in the case of clause "(ii)" of the
preceding sentence of this Section 7.3(a), within two business days following
termination of this Agreement; and (3) in the case of clause "(iii)" of the
preceding sentence of this Section 7.3(a), concurrently with a termination of
this Agreement under Section 7.1(f).

 

(b) If (i) this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.1(j), or (ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b) and at such time the Expiration Time has
been extended beyond the End Date pursuant to Section 1.1(d)(iv), then Parent
shall pay to the Company a termination fee in the amount of $25,000,000
(the " _Parent Termination Fee_ "), in the case of a termination of this
Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(j), within two business days
following the termination of this Agreement, and in the case of a termination
of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(b), concurrently with
such termination.

(c) Any Company Termination Fee due under Section 7.3(a) shall be paid by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by Parent. Any Parent Termination Fee due under Section 7.3(b) shall
be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Company. For the avoidance of doubt: (i) the
Company Termination Fee shall be payable only once and not in duplication even
though the Company Termination Fee may be payable under one or more
provisions hereof; and (ii) the Parent Termination Fee shall be payable only
once and not in duplication even though the Parent Termination Fee may be
payable under one or more provisions hereof. Each of the parties acknowledges
and agrees that neither the Parent Termination Fee nor the Company
Termination Fee shall constitute a penalty but instead is liquidated damages
in a reasonable amount that will compensate the party receiving such amount in
the circumstances in which it is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the

 



44  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision (it being
understood that nothing in this sentence shall limit the Companys or
Parents rights in the event of an intentional and material breach). If the
Company fails to pay the Company Termination Fee when due or if Parent fails
to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, then the party that has failed to
pay such amount shall also be required to pay to the other party interest on
such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date such
overdue amount is actually paid to Parent or the Company, as applicable) at a
rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as published in the _Wall Street
Journal_ ) in effect on the date such amount was originally required to be
paid (any such interest payment, an " _Interest Payment_ ").

(d) While each of the Company and Parent may pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with Section 8.13 and the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, under no
circumstances shall the Company or Parent be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance that results in the Acceptance Time or
the Effective Time occurring and the Parent Termination Fee or the Company
Termination Fee, as applicable.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
Section 5.14(c), if Parent or Acquisition Sub breaches this Agreement
(whether such breach is intentional and material, unintentional, willful or
otherwise) or fails to perform any of its covenants, obligations or agreements
hereunder (whether such failure is intentional and material,
unintentional, willful or otherwise), the Companys right to: (i) obtain an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with
the terms and limitations of Section 8.13; or (ii) terminate this Agreement
and: (A) receive the Parent Termination Fee in the circumstances under which
such fee is payable pursuant to Section 7.3(b) (and any related Interest
Payment); or (B) in any circumstance under which the Parent Termination Fee is
not payable pursuant to Section 7.3(b), seek money damages from Parent in the
event of Parents or Acquisition Subs intentional and material breach of any
of their representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or agreements
contained in this Agreement, shall be the sole and exclusive remedies
(whether such remedies are sought in equity or at law, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) of the Company and the Company Related Parties against the Parent
Related Parties or the Lender Related Parties for any losses, damages, costs,
expenses, obligations or liabilities arising out of or related to this
Agreement (or any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation
or agreement contained in this Agreement), the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (or any failure of such transactions to be consummated), the
Debt Commitment Letter and the financings contemplated therein (or any failure
of such financings to be consummated) or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection with this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or
the transactions contemplated therein. In no event shall: (1) the Company or
any other Company Related Party seek, directly or indirectly, to recover
against any Parent Related Parties (other than Parent and Acquisition Sub) or
Lender Related Parties, compel payment by any Parent Related Parties (other
than Parent and Acquisition Sub) or Lender Related Parties of, any damages or
other payments whatsoever or bring against any Parent Related Parties (other
than Parent and Acquisition Sub) or Lender Related Parties any actions, claims
or causes of action (whether such remedies are sought in equity or at law, in
contract, in tort or otherwise), in each case in this clause "(1)" arising
out of or related to this Agreement (or any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained herein), the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any failure of such
transactions to be consummated), the Debt Commitment Letter and the financings
contemplated therein (or any failure of such financings to be consummated), or
in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection with this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter; or (2) Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any other Parent Related Party seek, directly or
indirectly, to recover against any Company Related Party (other than the
Company), compel payment by any Company Related Party

 



45  (other than the Company) of, any damages or other payments whatsoever or
bring against any Company Related Party (other than the Company) any action,
claim or cause of action (whether any such remedy is sought in equity or at
law, in contract, in tort or otherwise), in each case in this clause "(2)"
arising out of or related to this Agreement (or any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation contained
herein), the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any failure of
such transactions to be consummated), the Debt Commitment Letter and the
financings contemplated therein (or any failure of such financings to be
consummated), or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be
made in connection with this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter.

8.9 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and

 



48  provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or

unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable
as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to
it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term

8.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by

Sub and the Surviving Corporation under this Agreement, and Parent shall be
jointly and severally liable with Acquisition Sub and the Surviving
Corporation for the due and timely performance and satisfaction of each of
said covenants, obligations and liabilities.

 

8.12 Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit
the ability of the Company or the Company Board to make any disclosure if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with counsel) that
failure to do so would create a material risk of either (a) a breach by the
Company Board of its fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Shares, or
(b) a violation of any Legal Requirement.

8.13 Specific Performance.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto agrees that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedy that a party hereto
may have under law or in equity, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company of any covenant
or obligation of such party contained in this Agreement, the other party shall
be entitled to obtain (i) a decree or order of specific performance to enforce
the observance and performance of such covenant (including with respect to
the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to accept for payment and pay
for Company Shares and the obligation of Parent to consummate the Merger); and
(ii) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach (including
with respect to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to accept for
payment and pay for Company Shares and the obligation of Parent to consummate
the Merger). In the event that any action is brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto shall allege, and each party
hereto hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate
remedy at law. Each party hereto further agrees that no other party hereto or
any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish, or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this Section 8.13, and each party hereto irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing, or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including Section 8.13(a)), it is explicitly agreed that the Company shall
have the right to obtain an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parents and Acquisition

 



49  Subs obligations to consummate (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL)
the Offer and to consummate the Merger if and only if: (i) all Offer
Conditions have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Expiration Time, but subject to such
conditions being able to be satisfied) or waived at the Expiration Time; (ii)
the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Acceptance Time;
and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent
that if an injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy is
granted, then it would take such actions required of it under this Agreement
to consummate (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) the Offer and to
consummate the Merger, as applicable.

8.14 Construction.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine

ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be
applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.
