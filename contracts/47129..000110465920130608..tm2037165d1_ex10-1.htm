side letters or arrangements to which the Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party relating to the Equity Financing, Athene Debt

of the Equity Fund to fund the Equity Financing, (B) conditions precedent to the obligations of Athene to fund the Athene Debt

Financing. As of the date hereof (assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in <U>Article VIII)</U>, the Buyer has
no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or waived at the Closing or that the funding
contemplated in the Financing will not be made available to the Buyer at the Closing in order to consummate the Transactions in

Debt Commitment Letter and the Third Party Debt Commitment Letter to be paid as of the date hereof, and as of the date hereof,
the Buyer is unaware of any fact or occurrence that would reasonably be expected to cause any Commitment Letter to be ineffective.
The aggregate proceeds of the Athene Debt Financing and the Equity Financing (to the extent not reduced by the aggregate amount
of Third Party Debt Financing (including any Alternative Financing) actually funded), when funded in accordance with the Commitment
Letters, will provide financing sufficient to pay all amounts to be paid or repaid by the Buyer under the Transaction Documents,

with the Transactions (the &ldquo;<U>Financing Uses</U>&rdquo;).</P>

10.12&#9;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Remedies</U>. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages would be inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged
that the parties hereto and the third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled to equitable relief, without proof
of actual damages, including an injunction or injunctions or Orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including any Order sought by the Selling Entities to
cause the Buyer to perform its agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement, including to cause the Buyer to enforce its
rights under the Athene Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter), in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Each party hereto further agrees that no
other party hereto or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection
with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this <U>Section 10.12</U>, and each party hereto (i) irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument, subject only
to the immediately succeeding sentence, and (ii) agrees to cooperate fully in any attempt by the other parties hereto in obtaining
such equitable relief. Each party hereto further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any
action for equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. If a court of
competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce the obligations of the Buyer to consummate the Closing pursuant to
a Claim for specific performance brought against the Buyer and has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged breach,
then Selling Entities or Hertz may enforce such award. In the event of a failure or threatened failure of the Buyer to enforce
the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter or the Athene Debt Commitment Letter, Hertz and the Seller shall be entitled to specific
performance to cause the Buyer to enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter and the Athene Debt Commitment Letter (or
any financing agreements related thereto), as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby further acknowledge
and agree that prior to the Closing, Hertz and/or the Selling Entities shall be entitled to specific performance to cause the
Buyer to draw down the full proceeds of the Equity Financing and the Athene Debt Financing and to cause Buyer to consummate the
Transactions and to effect the Closing in accordance with <U>Section 4.1</U>, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Agreement, if, and only if, (A) all conditions set forth in <U>Section 8.1</U> and <U>Section 8.2</U> (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing and which would be satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such time)
have been or will have been satisfied at the time when the Closing would be required to occur pursuant to <U>Section 4.1</U>,
(B) the Buyer fails to complete the Closing in accordance with <U>Section 4.1</U>, (C) the Third Party Debt Financing (including
any Alternative Financing) has been or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing and Athene Debt Financing are funded
at the Closing and (D) Hertz has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to the Buyer that the Selling Entities are prepared
to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.</FONT></P>

if Recipient does not agree to pay the increased costs or assume such increased obligations, Provider may allow such Contract

the particular portion of this Agreement where the term is used. The term &ldquo;or&rdquo; shall not be exclusive. The terms &ldquo;including,&rdquo;
 &ldquo;includes&rdquo; or similar terms when used herein means &ldquo;including, without limitation.&rdquo; The meaning of defined

is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period will be
excluded. If the last day of such period is a day other than a Business Day, the period in question will end on the next succeeding

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages
would be inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the parties hereto and the third-party beneficiaries of
this Agreement shall be entitled to equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction or injunctions
or Orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity as a remedy for any such breach
or threatened breach. Each party hereto further agrees that no other party hereto or any other Person shall be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
<U>Section 13(l)</U>, and each party hereto (i) irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument, subject only to the immediately succeeding sentence, and (ii) agrees to cooperate
fully in any attempt by the other parties hereto in obtaining such equitable relief. Each party hereto further agrees that the
only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for equitable relief is that it contests the existence of
a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.</P>

Debtors and their professionals conducted the sale process in compliance with the Bidding Procedures Order, and have afforded
potential purchasers a full and fair opportunity to make higher and better offers. The Purchaser has acted in good faith and in
compliance with the terms of the Bidding Procedures. In accordance with the Bidding Procedures, the Debtors determined that the
bid submitted by the Purchaser and memorialized by the Asset Purchase Agreement is the Successful Bid (as defined in the Bidding
Procedures). The Asset Purchase Agreement constitutes the highest and best offer for the Donlen Assets, and will provide a greater
recovery for the Debtors&rsquo; estates than would be provided by any other available alternative. The Debtors&rsquo; determination
that the Asset Purchase Agreement constitutes the highest and best offer for the Donlen Assets constitutes a valid and sound exercise

of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Sale Transaction and the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts,
constitutes an exercise of the Debtors&rsquo; sound business judgment and such acts are in the best interests of each Debtor,
its estate, and all parties in interest. The Court finds that each Debtor has articulated good and sufficient business reasons
justifying the Sale Transaction. Such business reasons include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the Asset Purchase
Agreement constitutes the highest and best offer for the Donlen Assets; (ii) the consideration to be received by the Debtors will
consist entirely of cash, which provides immediate liquidity and certainty of value for the Debtors and this certainty of value
is compelling compared to the uncertain long term value potential when accounting for the risks of continuing to operate the Donlen
Assets, particularly the risks inherent in operating while in bankruptcy and in a very uncertain business climate and the potential
for devaluation of the Assets; (iii) the Purchaser has agreed to assume the Assumed Liabilities; and (iv) unless the Sale Transaction
and all of the other transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement are concluded expeditiously, as provided for in
the Motion, the Bidding Procedures, and pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, recoveries to creditors may be diminished.</P>

</FONT>The Debtors and their professionals actively marketed the Donlen Assets to potential purchasers, as set forth in the Motion
and in accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order. The bidding and auction process set forth in the Bidding Procedures Order
and the Bidding Procedures afforded a full and fair opportunity for any entity to make a higher or otherwise better offer to purchase
the Donlen Assets. Based upon the record of these proceedings, all creditors and other parties in interest and all prospective
bidders have been afforded a reasonable and fair opportunity to bid for the Donlen Assets.</P>

would give equal or greater economic value to the Debtors in the aggregate than the value being provided by the Purchaser pursuant

maximize the return to their estates. The terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, including the consideration to
be realized by the Debtors, are fair and reasonable. Approval of the Motion, the Asset Purchase Agreement, and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Sale Transaction and the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts, is in the best
