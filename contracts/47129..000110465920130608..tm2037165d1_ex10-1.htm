the period prior to the Assumption Approval; (ii) in no event shall Buyer be

(f)  If the Selling Entities are unable to assume and assign

commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Closing to obtain, and to
cooperate in obtaining, all Consents and Governmental Authorizations from
Governmental Authorities and third parties necessary to assign such Assumed
Agreement or Assumed Real Property Lease to the Buyer and for the Buyer

Contract, if such Consent or Governmental Authorization has not been obtained
prior to the Closing. In such event, the Closing will proceed with respect to
the remaining Purchased Assets upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, and there will be no reduction in the Purchase Price as a result
thereof, and, for a period of six (6) months after the Closing Date (or the
remaining term of any such Contract or the closing of the Bankruptcy Cases,
if shorter), (A) the Seller and the Buyer will use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Consents with
respect to any such Contract and (B) the Seller and the Buyer will cooperate
in a mutually agreeable arrangement, to the extent feasible and without the
need for any Consent, under which the Buyer would obtain the benefits and
assume the obligations under such Contracts in accordance with this Agreement,

Section 3.5 _Determination of Cash Purchase Price Adjustment._

  



  

(a) Promptly after the Closing Date, and in any event not later than
forty five (45) days following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to Hertz a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the
Buyer's good faith calculations (the " _Buyer 's Proposed Calculations_") for
each of (i) the Working Capital (the  " _Closing Working Capital_ "), Fleet
Equity (the " _Closing Fleet Equity_ ") and Assumed Indebtedness Amount (the
" _Closing Assumed Indebtedness Amount_ "), in each case, as of 11:59 P.M.

the amount (which may be positive or negative) equal to (x) the Working

accordance with this Agreement based on such amounts. The Buyer's Proposed
Calculations shall be prepared in good faith and calculated in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. If the Buyer fails to timely deliver the
Closing Statement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence within
such forty five (45) day period, then, at the election of Hertz, in its sole
discretion, Hertz may by providing written notice delivered to the Buyer elect
to either (1) determine that the Closing Estimate Statement delivered by the
Seller to the Buyer pursuant to _Section 3.4_  shall be deemed final for all
purposes herein or (2) deliver the Closing Statement to the Buyer. If Hertz
elects _clause (2)_ above in this _Section 3.5(a)_ , the Accounting Firm (as
defined below) shall provide an audit of the Buyer's and its Subsidiaries'
books, determine the calculation of, and prepare, the Closing Statement
consistent with the provisions of this _Section 3.5_ , the determination of
the Closing Fleet Equity, the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Assumed
Indebtedness Amount and the Closing Adjustment by such Accounting Firm being
conclusive, final and binding on the parties hereto. Upon delivery by the
Buyer of the Buyer's Proposed Calculations or upon the election by Hertz to
deliver the Closing Statement to the Buyer pursuant to _clause (2)_ above in
this _Section 3.5(a)_ , the Buyer shall provide Hertz and its Representatives
with reasonable access, during normal business hours and with advance notice,
to the Buyer's auditors and accounting and other personnel providing
accounting services to the Buyer and the Business and to the books and
records of the Buyer, the Business and the Acquired Subsidiaries and any other
document or information reasonably requested by Hertz, in each case, relating
to the preparation of and calculations set forth in the Closing Statement
(including the work papers of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries' auditors
(subject to the execution of any non-reliance and access letters required by
any third party accountants and other personnel providing accounting
services to Buyer)), to allow Hertz and its Representatives to verify the
accuracy of the Buyer's Proposed Calculations or to prepare and deliver the
Closing Statement pursuant to _clause (2)_ above in this _Section 3.5(a)_.
Without the prior consent of Hertz, the Buyer shall not have the right to
modify Buyer's Proposed Calculations or any items or amounts set forth
therein after the Buyer delivers such calculations to Hertz.

  



  

   

37

 



    



  

(b)  If Buyer timely delivers Buyer's Proposed Calculations and
Hertz does not object to the Buyer's Proposed Calculations by written notice
of objection (the " _Notice of Objection_ ") delivered to the Buyer within
forty five (45) days after Hertz's receipt of the Buyer's Proposed
Calculations, the recalculation of the Cash Purchase Price pursuant to the
Buyer's Proposed Calculations shall be deemed final and binding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that the Buyer does not provide any materials
reasonably requested by Hertz at least 5 days prior to the end of such forty
five (45) day period, such forty five (45) day period shall be extended by
one (1) day for each additional day required for the Buyer to fully respond
to such request. A Notice of Objection shall set forth in reasonable detail
Hertz's alternative calculations of (i) the Closing Fleet Equity, the Closing
Working Capital, the Closing Assumed Indebtedness Amount and the Closing
Adjustment calculated by reference thereto and (ii) a recalculation of the
Cash Purchase Price based on such amounts. Without the prior consent of
Buyer, Hertz shall not have the right to modify the Notice of Objection or any
items or amounts set forth therein after Hertz delivers such calculations to
Buyer.

  



  

(c)  If Buyer timely delivers Buyer's Proposed Calculations and
Hertz delivers a Notice of Objection to the Buyer within the forty five (45)
day period referred to in _Section 3.5(b)_ , then (i) any amount of the
Buyer's Proposed Calculations that is not in dispute on the date such Notice
of Objection is given shall be treated as final and binding and (ii) any
dispute (all such disputed amounts, the " _Disputed Amounts_ ") shall be
resolved as follows:

  



  

(i) Hertz and the Buyer shall promptly endeavor in good faith to
resolve the Disputed Amounts listed in the Notice of Objection. All
such discussions related thereto (including any written communications,
analysis or calculations undertaken in connection with such discussions)
shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any
applicable similar state Law. If a written agreement between the Buyer and
Hertz determining the Disputed Amounts has not been reached within ten (10)
Business Days (or such longer period as may be agreed by the Buyer and Hertz)
after the date of receipt by the Buyer from Hertz of the Notice of Objection,
the resolution of such Disputed Amounts shall be submitted to a nationally
recognized independent accounting-firm to be mutually agreed by Buyer and
Hertz (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). Hertz and the Buyer will enter into a
customary engagement agreement with the Accounting Firm, including reasonable
access rights, and agree to cooperate in good faith with the Accounting Firm
during the term of its engagement. As promptly as practicable and not later
than ten (10) Business Days after the Accounting Firm is engaged, the Buyer
shall forward a copy of the Buyer's Proposed Calculation to the Accounting
Firm, and Hertz shall forward a copy of the Notice of Objection to the
Accounting Firm, together with, in each case, a written presentation and all
relevant documentation supporting the items remaining in dispute in the
Buyer's Proposed Calculation or the Notice of Objection, as the case may be.
After the Accounting Firm has received both presentations, the Accounting Firm
will share with the Buyer and Hertz their respective submissions to the
Accounting Firm. The Buyer and Hertz may each then submit a response to the
other's presentation, which shall be submitted to the Accounting Firm and such
other party within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such other party's
presentation. There shall be no ex parte communications by Hertz or the Buyer
or either of their respective Affiliates and their respective Representatives
with the Accounting Firm regarding the subject of such dispute;

  



  

   

38

 



    



  

(ii)  Hertz and the Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a decision
in accordance with this _Section 3.5_ along with a statement of reasons
therefor and to deliver a copy to each of the Buyer and Hertz of such
decision which shall include as a separate line item a determination of the
aggregate difference between the Cash Purchase Price and the Final Cash
Purchase Price within forty five (45) days of the submission of the Disputed
Amounts to the Accounting Firm. Absent manifest error, the decision of the
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding upon each of Hertz and the Buyer
and the decision of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding upon the
parties and enforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction;

  



  

(iii)  if Hertz and the Buyer submit any Disputed Amounts to the
Accounting Firm for resolution, Hertz and the Buyer shall each pay their own
costs and expenses incurred under this _Section 3.5(c)_. The fees and
disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the Buyer and
Hertz in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of Disputed Amounts
that were determined in favor of the other party (as finally determined by
the Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of disputed items submitted by
Hertz and the Buyer; and

  



  

(iv)  the Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator to determine, based upon the provisions of this _Section 3.5(c)_ ,
only the Disputed Amounts and the determination of each amount of the Disputed
Amounts shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. No
hearing with the Accounting Firm will be held and no discovery will be
permitted. No party will engage in ex parte communications with the
Accounting Firm. Hertz and the Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Accounting Firm's determination of the Disputed Amounts
to be no less than the lesser of the amount claimed by either Hertz or the
Buyer, and shall be no greater than the greater of the amount claimed by
either Hertz or the Buyer; provided, that if, notwithstanding the
commercially reasonable efforts of Hertz and the Buyer, (A) the Accounting
Firm's determination of any Disputed Amount is less than the lesser of the
amounts claimed by either Hertz or the Buyer, then such Disputed Amount shall
be deemed to be the lesser of the amounts claimed by either Hertz or the
Buyer in the Closing Statement or Notice of Objection, as applicable, or (B)
the Accounting Firm's determination of any Disputed Amount is more than the
greater of the amounts claimed by either Hertz or the Buyer, then such
Disputed Amount shall be deemed to be the greater of the amounts claimed by
either Hertz or the Buyer.

  



  

   

39

 



    



  

(d) Upon the determination, in accordance with _Sections 3.5(a)_ ,
_3.5(b)_ or _3.5(c)_ , of the final calculations of the amounts of the
Closing Fleet Equity, the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Assumed
Indebtedness Amount and the Closing Adjustment calculated by reference
thereto, the Cash Purchase Price shall be recalculated using such finally
determined amounts in lieu of the amounts used in the Closing Statement. The
term " _Final Cash Purchase Price_ " shall mean the result of
such recalculation of the Cash Purchase Price.

  



  

(i)  If the Final Cash Purchase Price is greater than the Cash
Purchase Price (an " _Upward Purchase Price Adjustment_ "), then the Buyer
shall within three (3) Business Days after the determination of the Final Cash
Purchase Price, pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account of Hertz an amount in cash equal to the Upward Purchase Price
Adjustment.

  



  

(ii)  If the Final Cash Purchase Price is less than the Cash
Purchase Price (a " _Downward Purchase Price Adjustment_ "), then Hertz shall
promptly pay to the Buyer (without interest) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account of the Buyer an amount in cash equal to the
Downward Purchase Price Adjustment.

  



  

(iii)  Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 3.5(d)_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

  



  

Section 3.6 _Allocation_. The Buyer shall, not later than ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, prepare and deliver to the Seller an allocation
of the Purchase Price (and the Assumed Liabilities, to the extent properly
taken into account under the Code) among the Purchased Assets (the "
_Allocation_ ") in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations for the Seller's review and approval. The Seller and the
Buyer shall work in good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding the
Allocation. If the Seller and the Buyer are unable to reach an agreement
within thirty (30) days of the Buyer's receipt of the Seller's objection, the
Seller and the Buyer shall each be entitled to adopt their own positions
regarding the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Seller and the Buyer do reach
agreement, the Buyer and the Seller agree to file all Tax Returns (including
the filing of IRS Form 8594 with their U.S. federal income Tax Return for the
taxable year that includes the date of the Closing) consistent with the
Allocation (as finally negotiated) unless otherwise required by applicable
Law. In administering the Bankruptcy Cases, the Bankruptcy Court shall not be
required to apply the Allocation in determining the manner in which
the Purchase Price should be allocated as between the Selling Entities and
their respective estates.

  



  

Section 3.7 _Withholding_. Buyer, its Affiliates and, effective upon the
Closing, the Acquired Subsidiaries, and any of their agents, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state,
local or non-U. S. Law. If any amount is so withheld, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person with respect to which such deduction or withholding was imposed.
Any Person that expects to so deduct or withhold (or expects its agent to so
deduct or withhold) any such amounts will take commercially reasonable efforts
to provide notice of the expected deduction or withholding at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the withholding to the Person with respect to which
the deduction or withholding is to be made (and the notice will include the
legal authority and the calculation method for the expected deduction or
withholding) (other than any deduction or withholding resulting from a failure
to provide certificates that exempt such amounts from withholding under
Section 1445 or 1446 of the Code), and the parties hereto will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate to minimize the amount of the
deduction or withholding in accordance with applicable Law.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLING ENTITIES

  



  

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Seller to the
Buyer (the " _Disclosure Schedule_ ") concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, each Selling Entity jointly and severally hereby represents and
warrants to the Buyer as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date as
follows:

  



  

   

42

 



    



  

Section 5.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each Selling Entity and each
Acquired Subsidiary is an entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the
extent applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization. Each Selling Entity and each Acquired Subsidiary has all
requisite power (corporate or otherwise) and authority to own, lease and
operate all of its properties and assets required for the Business and to
carry on the Business as it is now being conducted, except as has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an
adverse effect on the Business or the Purchased Assets, taken as a whole, in
any material respect and would not materially impair or delay the ability of
Hertz or any Selling Entity to consummate the Transactions. Each Selling
Entity and each Acquired Subsidiary is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the Business or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by the
Business makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, an adverse effect on
the Business or the Purchased Assets, taken as a whole, in any material
respect and would not materially impair or delay the ability of Hertz or any
Selling Entity to consummate the Transactions. No Acquired Subsidiary is in
material violation of any of the provisions of its Organizational Documents.
Seller has made available to Buyer a copy of the Organizational Documents of
each Acquired Subsidiary.

  



  

Section 5.2 _Acquired Subsidiaries and Purchased Assets_.

  



  

(a)  All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of (or comparable
equity interest in) each Acquired Subsidiary (i) are owned directly or
indirectly by the Selling Entities, (ii) are free and clear of any Encumbrance
(other than (A) Encumbrances created by the Buyer or arising out of ownership
of the Equity Interests by the Buyer, (B) restrictions on transfer of
unregistered securities arising under applicable federal, state or foreign
securities Laws or (C) under the Organizational Documents of the Acquired
Subsidiaries) and (iii) have been duly authorized, validly issued and are
fully paid and, to the extent applicable, non-assessable. _Section 5.2(a)_ of
the Disclosure Schedule lists all of the Acquired Subsidiaries and the
outstanding shares of capital stock thereof, or other equity securities
therein and, in each case, the owner(s) thereof. There are no options,
warrants, convertible securities or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments relating to the Equity Interests (other than this Agreement)
obligating any Acquired Subsidiary to issue, sell or transfer, or repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire, any shares of capital stock of, or any other
equity interest in, an Acquired Subsidiary (other than this Agreement). No
Acquired Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other
equity interest in any other Person (other than an Acquired Subsidiary). There
are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings with respect to
the equity interests of the Acquired Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b)  Each Selling Entity, as applicable, has indefeasible title to, and
owns and possesses all rights and interests in, including the right to use,
each of the Purchased Assets, or with respect to leased Purchased Assets,
valid leasehold interests in, or with respect to licensed Purchased Assets,
valid licenses to use, except where failure to hold such title, rights or
interests (i) has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, an adverse effect on the Business or the
Purchased Assets, taken as a whole, in any material respect and would not
materially impair or delay the ability of Hertz or any Selling Entity to
consummate the Transactions or (ii) would be cured as a result of the entry of
the Sale Order. At the Closing (after giving effect to the Transaction),
Buyer or its permitted assigns will have good title to (or in the case of
Purchased Assets that are leased, valid leasehold interests in) the Purchased
Assets free and clear of any Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances
except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, an adverse effect on the Business or the
Purchased Assets, taken as a whole, in any material respect and would not
materially impair or delay the ability of Hertz or any Selling Entity to
consummate the Transactions.

  



  

   

43

 



    



  

(c) The Acquired Subsidiaries have engaged in no business other in
connection with the Existing Structured Financings (the " _Donlen ABS
Business_ ") and the holding of interests in other entities that engage solely
in the Donlen ABS Business. Except as set forth in the Seller Financial
Statements, the Acquired Subsidiaries have no Liabilities other than any
Liabilities entered into in connection with the Existing ABS Financings, no
assets other than the vehicles subject to the Existing Structured
Financings and no employees.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_.
Subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the entry and
effectiveness of the Bidding Procedures Order, each of the Selling Entities
has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, to perform and
comply with each of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and, upon entry
and effectiveness of the Sale Order, in accordance with the terms hereof, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
execution and delivery by the Selling Entities of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents to which any Selling Entity is a party, the
performance and compliance by the Selling Entities with each of their
obligations herein and therein, and the consummation by it of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or similar action on the part of the Selling Entities,

Disclosure Schedule, of (i) the unaudited combined statement of operating
results of the Business for the fiscal years ended as of December 31, 2018
and December 31, 2019 (collectively, the " _Year-End Operating Statements_
"); (ii) the unaudited combined statement of operating results of the

the Cash Flow Statements, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied throughout the periods indicated (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or in _Section 5.8(b)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule). On that basis the Seller Financial Statements fairly present, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Business as of the
respective dates thereof and the respective operating results of the Business

in the case of the Interim Operating Statements, subject to normal and
recurring year-end adjustments (the effect of which are not material whether

differ in amount or nature from those included in the annual Seller
Financial Statements); _provided_ , that, the Seller Financial Statements and
the foregoing representations and warranties are qualified by the fact that
the Business has not operated as a separate stand-alone entity and has
received certain allocated charges and credits which do not necessarily
reflect amounts which would have resulted from arm's length transactions or
which the Business would incur on a stand-alone basis.

13a-15 under the Exchange Act in all material respects. No Selling Entity or,
to the Seller's Knowledge, any independent registered public accounting firm,
has identified or been made aware of "significant deficiencies" or "material
weaknesses" (as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in
the design or operation of the Seller's internal controls over and procedures
relating to financial reporting which would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect in any material respect the ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data, in each case which has not been
subsequently remediated.

_(S)_ applies to items  _(C)_ , _(E)_ , _(H)_ , _(N)_ , _(P)_ , _(Q)_ or
_(R))_ if such actions were taken or not taken after the date hereof but
prior to the Closing or earlier termination of this Agreement.

applicable Laws.

  



  

(c) Each Parent Benefit Plan and Seller Benefit Plan that is intended

of the Seller, no fact or event has occurred that could reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Parent Benefit Plan and
Seller Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.

  



  

(d) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

employee, officer, director or other Person with respect to any Selling Entity
or any Acquired Subsidiary who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term
is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Seller
Benefit Plan would reasonably be expected to be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No Parent
Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plan provides, and no Acquired Subsidiary has
an obligation to provide, for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under
Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code with respect to any Employee.

former director, officer, employee or individual independent contractor of
any Acquired Subsidiary to any additional material compensation or benefit
(including any bonus, retention or severance pay), (ii) accelerate the
vesting or result in any material increase, payment or funding of compensation
or benefits under any of the Parent Benefit Plans or Seller Benefit Plans or

65

 



    



  

Section 6.6 _Buyer Financing._

  



  

(a) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Buyer has delivered to the Seller true, correct and complete copies of (a) an
executed commitment letter addressed to the Buyer, dated as of the date
hereof (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ "), from Athene USA Corporation (the
" _Equity Fund_ "), to provide equity financing in an aggregate amount of $400
million (the " _Equity Financing_ "), (b) an executed debt commitment letter,
and the executed fee letter associated therewith, dated as of the date hereof
(such commitment letter, including all exhibits, term sheets, schedules,
annexes, supplements and amendments thereto and each such fee letter,
collectively " _Athene Debt Commitment Letter_ "), from Athene
USA Corporation (" _Athene_ ") to provide debt financing in an aggregate
amount of $550 million (the " _Athene Debt Financing_ ") and (c) an executed
debt commitment letter and the executed fee letter associated therewith (
_provided_ , that (x) such fee letter does not contain any "flex" terms
and(y) fee amounts, and other economic terms of the fee letter may be
redacted in a customary manner so long as no redaction covers terms that would
reduce the amount of the Third Party Debt Financing below the amount required
to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into account the amount of Equity
Financing and the Athene Debt Financing) or adversely affect the
conditionality, availability or termination of the Third Party Debt
Financing), dated as of the date hereof (such commitment letter(s), including
all exhibits, term sheets, schedules, annexes, supplements and amendments
thereto and each such fee letter, collectively, " _Third Party Debt Commitment
Letter_ " and, together with the Athene Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity
Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ "), from the Debt Financing
Sources, pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have committed subject
to the terms and conditions thereof, to lend the amounts set forth therein
for purposes of funding a portion of the Transactions at Closing (the " _Third
Party Debt Financing_ ", and the Third Party Debt Financing together with the
Equity Financing and the Athene Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ "). Each of
Seller and Hertz are express third-party beneficiaries of the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Athene Debt Commitment Letter.

  



  

(b) As of the date hereof, (i) the Equity Commitment Letter,
the Athene Debt Commitment Letter and the Third Party Debt Commitment
Letter are, as to the Buyer and, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, the other
parties thereto, valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto,
enforceable by and against such parties in accordance with their terms and
(ii) the Equity Commitment Letter, the Athene Debt Commitment Letter and the
Third Party Debt Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect other than in accordance with
_Section 7.8(b)_ , and (iii) no event has occurred that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach
on the part of the Buyer under any term or condition of the Equity Commitment
Letter, the Athene Debt Commitment Letter or the Third Party Debt Commitment
Letter. There are no other agreements, side letters or arrangements to which
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party relating to the Equity
Financing, Athene Debt Financing or the Third Party Debt Financing that could
affect the availability (including by imposing additional conditions
precedent) or amount of any such Financing at Closing. Except as set forth,
described or provided for in the Equity Commitment Letter, the Athene Debt
Commitment Letter and the Third Party Debt Commitment Letter, there are no (A)
conditions precedent to the obligations of the Equity Fund to fund the Equity
Financing, (B) conditions precedent to the obligations of Athene to fund the
Athene Debt Financing or (C) conditions precedent to the respective
obligations of the Debt Financing Sources to provide the Third Party
Debt Financing. As of the date hereof (assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII)_ , the Buyer has no reason to believe
that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or waived at
the Closing or that the funding contemplated in the Financing will not be
made available to the Buyer at the Closing in order to consummate the
Transactions in accordance with this Agreement. The Buyer has fully paid any
and all commitment fees, if any, or other fees required by the Athene Debt
Commitment Letter and the Third Party Debt Commitment Letter to be paid as of
the date hereof, and as of the date hereof, the Buyer is unaware of any fact
or occurrence that would reasonably be expected to cause any Commitment Letter
to be ineffective. The aggregate proceeds of the Athene Debt Financing and
the Equity Financing (to the extent not reduced by the aggregate amount of
Third Party Debt Financing (including any Alternative Financing) actually
funded), when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters, will provide
financing sufficient to pay all amounts to be paid or repaid by the Buyer
under the Transaction Documents, and all of the Buyer's and its Affiliates'
fees and expenses, including the Buyer Expense Payment Amount,
associated with the Transactions (the " _Financing Uses_ ").

  



  

   

66

 



    



  

(c) Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article VIII_ and (b) the accuracy in all material respects of the
representations and warranties of the Selling Entities set forth in _Article
V_ hereof, then immediately upon the consummation of the Transactions, (i)
the Buyer will not be insolvent as defined in Section 101 of the Bankruptcy
Code, (ii) Buyer will not be left with unreasonably small capital to conduct
the Business to be conducted following the Closing Date, and (iii) the Buyer
will not have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they
mature.

  



  

Section 6.7 _Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism and Similar
Laws._

  



  

(a) None of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or, to the
Knowledge of the Buyer, after reasonable review of publicly available
information, any of the Buyer's beneficial owners is included on a Government
List or is owned in any amount or controlled by any Person on a Government
List, as amended from time to time.

  



  

(b) None of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or, to the
Knowledge of the Buyer, after reasonable review of publicly available
information, any of the Buyer's beneficial owners is acting, directly or
indirectly, on behalf of terrorists, terrorist organizations or
narcotics traffickers, including those Persons or entities that appear on any
Government List, as amended from time to time.

  



  

(c) None of the funds to be used to purchase the Purchased
Assets or in connection with the Transactions shall be knowingly derived
from any activities that contravene any applicable Laws concerning money
laundering, terrorism, narcotics trafficking, or bribery, or from any Person,
entity, country, or territory on a Government List.

  



  

Section 6.8 _Investment Canada Act_. The Buyer is either not a "non-
Canadian" or, if it is a "non-Canadian" it is not a "state-owned enterprise"
for the purposes of the Investment Canada Act.

  



  

Section 6.9 _Related Party._ To the Knowledge of the Buyer, the
Buyer is not "related" within the meaning of Sections 267 or 707 of the Code
to any Selling Entity.

  



  

   

67

 



    



  

Section 6.10 _Independent Evaluation; Reliance by the Buyer._ The
Buyer has conducted its own independent investigation, verification, review
and analysis of the business, operations, assets, Liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition, technology and prospects of the Business,
the Purchased Assets (including the Acquired Subsidiaries) and the Assumed
Liabilities, which investigation, verification, review and analysis was
conducted by the Buyer and its Affiliates and, to the extent the Buyer deemed
appropriate, by Buyer's Representatives. The Buyer acknowledges that it and
its Representatives have been provided adequate access to the personnel,
properties, premises and records of the Selling Entities and the Acquired
Subsidiaries. In entering into this Agreement, the Buyer acknowledges that it
has relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation, verification, review
and analysis and not on any factual representation, warranty, inducement,
promise, understanding, omission, condition or opinion of the Selling Entities
or any of their Affiliates or their respective Representatives (except the
specific representations and warranties set forth in _Article V_ , in
each case, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedule thereto, or any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement), and the Buyer acknowledges
and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that:

  



  

(a)  none of the Selling Entities or Acquired Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Affiliates, or any of their
respective Representatives, direct or indirect equityholders or members or

express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of (A) any of the
information set forth in management presentations relating to the Business,
the Purchased Assets (including the Acquired Subsidiaries) or the Assumed
Liabilities made available to the Buyer, its Affiliates or its
Representatives, in materials made available in any "data room" (virtual or
otherwise), including any cost estimates delivered or made available,
financial projections or other projections, in presentations by
the management of the Selling Entities or their respective Affiliates, in
"break-out" discussions, in responses to questions submitted by or on behalf
of the Buyer, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives, whether
orally or in writing, in materials prepared by or on behalf of any Selling
Entity or Acquired Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives, or in any other form (such information, collectively, " _Due
Diligence Materials_ "), or (B) any information delivered or made available
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ or (C) the financial information, projections or
other forward-looking statements with respect to the Business, in each case
in expectation or furtherance of the Transactions;

  



  

(b)  none of the Selling Entities or Acquired Subsidiaries or
any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective Representatives, direct
or indirect equityholders or members or any other Person shall have any
Liability or responsibility whatsoever to the Buyer, its Affiliates or their
respective Representatives on any basis (including in contract, tort or
equity, under federal or state securities Laws or otherwise) based on any Due
Diligence Materials; provided, that the foregoing shall not limit Liability
against the underwriter under a buy-side representations and warranties
insurance policy provided to, and paid for, by the Buyer for breach of the
representations and warranties of the Selling Entities set forth in _Article
V_ ;

  



  

(c)  without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Selling Entities, the Acquired Subsidiaries, their respective Affiliates and

respective Affiliates or Representatives, even if the same were made
available for review by the Buyer or its Representatives; and

  



  

   

68

expressly acknowledges and agrees that none of the documents, information or
other materials provided to them at any time or in any format by the Selling

Section 7.3 _Access to and Delivery of Information; Maintenance of Records._

  



  

(a)  Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date or
the earlier valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
to the extent permitted by Law, the Selling Entities shall, during ordinary
business hours for any physical access and upon the reasonable prior request
from the Buyer, except as would be imprudent or impossible in light of any
Emergency Event, give the Buyer and the Buyer's Representatives reasonable
access (at the Buyer's sole expense) including, to the extent practicable, at
Buyer's or Buyer's Representatives written request, through data rooms, video
or conference calls or other methods of virtual access, to (x) the Seller's
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other authorized
outside Representatives, officers and senior management possessing
information relating to the Business, (y) all books, records and
other documents and data relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets
(including the Acquired Subsidiaries) or the Assumed Liabilities in the
locations in which they are normally maintained, and (z) subject to all
applicable Law and, with respect to any physical access, the Parent Group's
COVID-19 virus policies, all offices and other facilities of the Selling
Entities and the Acquired Subsidiaries included in the Purchased Assets, to
make such investigation and physical inspection of the Purchased Assets
and the Assumed Liabilities as it reasonably requests _provided_ , _however_
, that, in connection with such access, the Buyer and the Buyer's
Representatives shall minimize disruption to the Business, the Bankruptcy
Cases and the Auction; _provided further_ that in connection with the Buyer's
and/or the Buyer's Representatives' access of such offices and other
facilities, the Buyer and/or the Buyer's Representatives shall be accompanied
at all times by a representative of Hertz and the Selling Entities unless
Hertz otherwise agrees, shall not materially interfere with the use and
operation of such offices and other facilities, and shall comply with all
reasonable safety and security rules and regulations for such offices and
other facilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Hertz or the Selling Entities may restrict the foregoing access
and shall not be required to (I) provide any information or access that the
Selling Entities reasonably believe would violate applicable Law, including
Antitrust Laws and data protection Laws or the terms of any applicable
Contract (including confidentiality obligations) or cause forfeiture of any
attorney-client privilege or an expectation of client confidence or any other
rights to any evidentiary privilege (such limitations, " _Disclosure
Limitations_ "); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Buyer and the Selling
Entities shall reasonably cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow
disclosure of such information to the extent doing so would not (in the good
faith belief of the Seller after consultation with outside
counsel) reasonably be likely to cause such violation to occur or such
privilege to be undermined with respect to such information (II) provide any
information relating to the sale process, bids received from other Persons in
connection with the Transactions and information and analysis (including
financial analysis) relating to such bids (except to the extent provided under
the Bidding Procedures Order) or (III) conduct, or permit the Buyer or any of
its Representatives to conduct, any Phase I or Phase II environmental site
assessment or investigation, or other environmental sampling relating to any
Leased Real Property. For purposes of this _Section 7.3(a)_ , Buyer's
Representatives shall include the Debt Financing Sources. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Hertz and the Selling Entities' obligations to cooperate with
respect to the Buyer arrangement of the Total Financing shall be limited to
the obligations set forth in _Section 7.9._ The Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
documents, materials, communications, analyses and other information relating
to the sale process, bids received from the Buyer and other Persons in
connection with the Transactions are in the possession of the Selling Entities
or any Acquired Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement and through the
Closing will be transferred to the Seller prior to, or as of, the Closing and
the Seller shall not be required to grant access to such documents, materials
and other information to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates at any time.

(b)  From and after the Closing, for a period of seven (7) years
following the Closing Date (or, if later, the closing of the
Bankruptcy Cases), the Buyer will provide Hertz and the Selling Entities (and
their respective successors) and their respective Representatives, at the
Seller's sole expense, with reasonable access, during normal business hours,
and upon reasonable advance notice, subject to reasonable denials of access
or delays to the extent any such access would unreasonably interfere with the
operations of the Buyer or the Business and compliance with any health and
safety policies of the Buyer and/or the Business, including with respect to
COVID-19, to the books and records, including work papers, schedules,
memoranda, and other documents (for the purpose of examining and copying)
relating to the Purchased Assets, the Excluded Assets, the Assumed Liabilities
or the Excluded Liabilities with respect to periods or occurrences prior to
the Closing Date, for the purposes of (i) complying with the requirements of
any Governmental Authority, including the Bankruptcy Court, (ii) the closing
of the Bankruptcy Cases and the wind down of the Selling Entities' estates
(including reconciliation of Claims), (iii) making insurance Claims, (iv)
complying with applicable Laws and (v) defending or prosecuting any

connection with Hertz's or any Selling Entity's or their respective
Representatives' access to offices and other facilities of the Buyer, Hertz,
such Selling Entity or their Representatives shall be accompanied at all times
by a representative of the Buyer unless the Buyer otherwise agrees, shall not
materially interfere with the use and operation of such offices and other
facilities, and shall comply with all reasonable safety and security rules
and regulations for such offices and other facilities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Buyer shall not be obligated to provide any such access that
would conflict with the Disclosure Limitations;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Buyer and the Selling Entities shall reasonably cooperate in seeking
to find a way to allow disclosure of such information to the extent doing so
would not (in the good faith belief of the Buyer after consultation with
outside counsel) reasonably be likely to cause such violation to occur or such
privilege to be undermined with respect to such information.

  



  

(c)  Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Hertz, the
Buyer will not, for a period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date
(or, if later, the closing of the Bankruptcy Cases), destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of any of such books and records contemplated by _Section
7.3 (b)_ without first offering to surrender to the Seller such books and
records or any portion thereof that the Buyer may intend to destroy, dispose
of or alter. From and after the Closing, the Buyer will, at the Seller's sole
expense, provide the Selling Entities with reasonable assistance, support and
cooperation with the wind-down of the operations and related activities
_(e.g.,_ helping to locate documents or information related to prosecution or
processing of insurance/benefit Claims) of the Selling Entities.

  



  

(d)  Until the two (2)-year anniversary of the Closing Date,
Hertz will, and will cause its controlled Affiliates and its and their
Representatives to, hold in confidence, and without the prior written consent
of Buyer, not disclose other than as expressly set forth in _Section 7.3
(b)(i)-(v)_, any confidential, proprietary or non-public information involving
or relating to any of the Purchased Assets (including the Acquired
Subsidiaries) or Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this 
_Section 7.3(d)_ shall not (i) apply to information that is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by
Hertz or any of its affiliates or its Representatives in breach of this
_Section 7.3(d)_ or (ii) prohibit any disclosure (A) required by Law
(including disclosure required in respect of Hertz's or its Affiliates' Tax
returns) or required or requested by any Governmental Authority, in each case
so long as, to the extent legally permissible and feasible, Hertz provides
Buyer with reasonable prior notice of such disclosure so that Buyer may seek
to obtain a protective order or other reasonable assurance that such
disclosure shall be treated confidentially (at Buyer's sole cost and
expense) or (B) made in connection with any litigation regarding the
Transaction Documents or the Transactions.

  



  

   

74

 



    



  

(e)  From and after the Closing, for a period of seven (7) years
following the Closing Date (or, if later, the closing of the Bankruptcy
Cases), Hertz and the Selling Entities will provide Buyer (and their
respective successors) and their respective Representatives, at the Buyer's
sole expense, with reasonable access, during normal business hours, and upon
reasonable advance notice, subject to reasonable denials of access or delays
to the extent any such access would unreasonably interfere with the operations
of Hertz, its controlled Affiliates or their respective businesses and
compliance with any health and safety policies of Hertz or its
controlled Affiliates, including with respect to COVID-19, to the books and
records, including work papers, schedules, memoranda, and other documents
(for the purpose of examining) and the Seller's accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other authorized outside Representatives, officers and
senior management possessing information, in each case relating to the
Business, the Purchased Assets (including the Acquired Subsidiaries), the
Excluded Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Excluded Liabilities with
respect to periods or occurrences prior to the Closing Date; provided, that
to the extent solely relating to Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities,
such access shall be for the purposes of the Buyer's (i) making insurance
Claims, (ii) complying with applicable Laws, (iii) defending or prosecuting
any Proceeding to which any Buyer or its Affiliates is a party; (iv) preparing
financial statements and regulatory filings and (v) providing employee
benefits; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in connection with such access, the
Buyer and the Buyer's Representatives shall minimize disruption to the
Business, the Bankruptcy Cases and the Auction; _provided_ _further_ that
in connection with the Buyer's and/or the Buyer's Representatives' access
of such offices and other facilities, the Buyer and/or the Buyer's
Representatives shall be accompanied at all times by a representative of
Hertz and the Selling Entities unless Hertz otherwise agrees, shall not
materially interfere with the use and operation of such offices and other
facilities, and shall comply with all reasonable safety and security rules and
regulations for such offices and other facilities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Hertz and its controlled Affiliates shall not be obligated to
provide any such access that would conflict with the Disclosure Limitations;
_provided_ , that Hertz and its controlled Affiliates shall reasonably
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information to
the extent doing so would not (in the good faith belief of Hertz after
consultation with outside counsel) reasonably be likely to cause such
violation to occur or such privilege to be undermined with respect to such
information.

  



  

(f)  All information obtained by the Buyer or the Buyer's
Representatives pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ shall be subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement prior to and upon the Closing.

  



  

Section 7.4 _Expenses. _ Except to the extent otherwise specifically provided
herein, including in _Section 7.14_ , the Sale Order, or the
Bidding Procedures Order, whether or not the Transactions are consummated,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be borne by the party hereto incurring such costs and
expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, any expenses of the Acquired
Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be
deemed expenses of the Selling Entities.

  



  

   

75

(b)  From time to time, on or after the Closing Date until the
dissolution and liquidation of the Selling Entities, the Selling Entities

more effectively vest in the Buyer all of the Selling Entities' right, title
and interest to the Purchased Assets and assignments of all interest in
Assumed Agreements, free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances) and Claims (other than Assumed Liabilities).

behalf of the Buyer, (ii) prohibit any Selling Entity from ceasing operations
or winding up its affairs following the Closing so long as the other Selling
Entities or its Affiliates assumes responsibility and are able to perform any
remaining post-Closing obligations of such Selling Entity, or (iii) prohibit
the Selling Entities from taking such actions as are necessary to conduct the
Auction or as would otherwise be permitted under _Section 7.1._

Agreement shall be a joint press release, the text of which shall be agreed
to in writing by the Buyer, on the one hand, and Hertz, on the other hand.
Thereafter, unless otherwise required by or reasonably necessary to comply

with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions and shall not, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, issue any such

conditioned or delayed), except that no such consent shall be necessary to
the extent disclosure is made on the record at a hearing in connection with
this Agreement or the Bankruptcy Cases; _provided_ , that nothing in this
Agreement shall restrict or prohibit (a) Hertz, Buyer or their respective
Affiliates from making any announcement to their respective employees,

respects with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made by any party hereto in accordance with this Agreement,
including in investor conference calls, SEC filings, QandAs or other publicly
disclosed statements or documents, in each case under this _clause (ii)_ , to

to their employees or existing or prospective limited partners or other
investors, in each case, subject to the terms of the

(a)  The Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to)

actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and obtain the Equity Financing contemplated by the
Equity Commitment Letter and the Athene Debt Financing contemplated by the

its obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter and the Athene Debt
Commitment Letter, (ii) maintaining in effect the Equity Commitment Letter
and the Athene Debt Commitment Letter until consummation of the Closing, (iii)
satisfying or obtaining a waiver of (and causing its Affiliates to satisfy or
obtain a waiver of), on a timely basis all conditions contained in the Equity
Commitment Letter and the Athene Debt Commitment Letter, (iv) if all
conditions to the Equity Financing and the Athene Debt Financing have been
satisfied in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter and the Athene Debt
Commitment Letter, respectively, causing the Persons committing to fund the
Equity Financing and the Athene Debt Financing at the Closing and
(v) diligently enforcing all of its rights under the Equity Commitment Letter
and the Athene Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive agreements relating
to the Equity Financing and the Athene Debt Financing, including through
litigation. The Buyer shall give Hertz and the Seller prompt notice upon
having knowledge of any actual or potential breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Equity Commitment Letter and the Athene Debt
Commitment Letter or any of the definitive documents related to the Equity
Financing and the Athene Debt Financing. The Buyer shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Athene Debt Commitment
Letter without the prior written consent of Hertz.

  



  

   

79

 



    



  

(b)  The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary or advisable to obtain the Third Party Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Third Party Debt Commitment Letter on
or prior to the Closing, including: (i) complying with its obligations under
the Third Party Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) entering into definitive
agreements with respect to the Third Party Debt Financing on a timely basis
on the terms and conditions contained in the Third Party Debt Commitment
Letter or on other terms that, with respect to conditionality, amount of
commitment thereunder and availability at Closing only, are not less favorable
to the Buyer or the Selling Entities than those contained in the Third Party
Debt Commitment Letter (as in effect on the date hereof) and maintaining in
effect such definitive agreements until consummation of the Closing; (iii)
satisfying (or, if deemed advisable by the Buyer, seek a waiver of) on a
timely basis all conditions in the Third Party Debt Commitment Letter and such
definitive agreements that are applicable to and are within the control of
the Buyer, including the payment of any fees required as a condition to the
Third Party Debt Financing; (iv) maintaining in effect the Third Party Debt

(c)  The Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of Hertz, take or fail to
take any action or enter into any transaction that could reasonably be
expected to materially impair, delay or prevent consummation of the Financing
required for the Financing Uses. If at any time it becomes likely that any
portion of the Third Party Debt Financing or the Athene Debt Financing
necessary to fund the Financing Uses (after taking into account the amount
of the Equity Financing) shall become unavailable on the terms and conditions
contemplated in the Athene Debt Commitment Letter or the Third Party Debt
Commitment Letter, as applicable, the Buyer promptly (and in any event within
two (2) Business Days) shall notify the Seller and Hertz of such
unavailability and shall thereafter use its reasonable best efforts, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, to seek and
to arrange to obtain alternative financing in an amount sufficient to
satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking into account the amount of the
Equity Financing and, if applicable, the Athene Debt Financing) ("
_Alternative Financing_ "), including from alternative sources on terms and
conditions that are not less favorable in any material respect to Buyer
(including with respect to the third party beneficiary rights in favor of the
Seller contained in the Athene Debt Financing or to the extent related to
Alternative Financing for the Athene Debt Financing) than those contained in
the Athene Debt Commitment Letter or the Third Party Debt Commitment Letter,
as applicable, and which shall not expand upon the conditions precedent to
the funding on the Closing Date of the Financing as set forth in any of the
Commitment Letters in effect on the date hereof. For the purposes of this
Agreement, all references to the Athene Debt Financing and the Third
Party Debt Financing shall be deemed to include such Alternative Financing,
all references to the Athene Debt Commitment Letter and the Third Party Debt
Commitment Letter shall include the applicable documents for the Alternative
Financing.

(d)  The Buyer shall keep Hertz and the Seller informed on a
prompt basis upon request and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange and consummate the Financing and shall give Hertz and the
Seller prompt written notice (i) of any actual or threatened in writing
breach or default by the Buyer or, to the Knowledge of the Buyer, of any other
party to the Commitment Letters, (ii) of any actual or threatened in writing
termination of the Commitment Letters by the Buyer or, to the Knowledge
of the Buyer, by any other party to the Commitment Letters or (iii) if at any
time the Buyer reasonably believes in good faith that it will not be able to
obtain the Financing necessary to satisfy the Financing Uses (after taking
into account the amount of the Equity Financing and the Athene Debt
Financing). Without the prior written consent of Hertz, the Buyer shall not,
and shall not permit any other Person to, amend, modify, supplement, waive,
restate or replace the Commitment Letters (other than any amendment of the
Third Party Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or any person with similar roles or titles
who had not executed the Third Party Debt Commitment Letter as of the date
hereof) other than (1) amendments, modifications or waivers to the Third
Party Debt Commitment Letter that would not reduce the aggregate amount of the
Third Party Debt Financing to an amount below the amount necessary to satisfy
the Financing Uses (after taking into account the amount of the Equity
Financing and the Athene Debt Financing) unless the Equity Financing or the
Athene Debt Financing is increased by a corresponding amount, (2) amendments,
modifications or waivers to the Third Party Debt Commitment Letter that would
not impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise expand on any
conditions under the Third Party Debt Commitment Letter or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing or the funding of the
Third Party Debt Financing, the Athene Debt Financing or the Equity Financing
or (3) amendments, modifications or waivers to the Third Party Debt
Commitment Letter that would not materially adversely impact the ability of
Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Third Party Debt
Commitment Letter; provided, that no such amendment, modification or waiver
described in the foregoing _clauses (1)_ through _(3)_ shall be permitted to
the extent such amendment, modification or waiver would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay Closing or any of the Transactions.
The Buyer shall provide notice to Hertz and the Seller promptly upon
receiving the Athene Debt Financing and the Third Party Debt Financing.

  



  

(e)  The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to
consummate the Transactions are not in any way conditioned or contingent upon
or otherwise subject to, receipt of the Financing or other financing or the
availability, grant, provision or extension of any Financing or other
financing of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this _Section 7.8_ will require, and in no
event will the reasonable best efforts of Buyer be deemed or construed to
require, Buyer to (i) bring any enforcement action against any Equity
Financing or Athene Debt Financing source to enforce its rights pursuant to
the Equity Commitment Letter or the Athene Debt Commitment Letter; (ii) seek
the Equity Financing or Athene Debt Financing from any source other than a
counterparty to, or in any amount in excess of that contemplated by, the
Equity Commitment Letter or the Athene Debt Commitment Letter, or (iii) pay
any material fees in excess of those contemplated by the Commitment Letters.

(vii) [Reserved];

  



  

(viii) using reasonable best efforts to cause the independent auditors
of the Business to attend a reasonable number of accounting due
diligence sessions and drafting sessions;

  



  

(ix) (A) furnishing the Buyer and the Total Financing Sources as
directed by the Buyer, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the

Existing Structured Financing and the collateral secured thereunder,
including the applicable offering documentation and underlying
transaction documentation, and, to the extent available or prepared in the

 _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Selling Entities shall not
be required to provide, or cause any Acquired Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates or their respective Representatives to provide,
cooperation under this _Section 7.9(a)_ that: (A) unreasonably interferes
with the ongoing business of any Selling Entity or any Acquired Subsidiary;
(B) causes any representation, warranty covenant or agreement in this
Agreement to be breached; or (C) causes any closing condition set forth in
_Article VIII_ to fail to be satisfied or otherwise causes the breach of this
Agreement or any Contract to which any Selling Entity, any Acquired
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates is a party. For
the avoidance of doubt, no Selling Entity, Acquired Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof shall be required to provide, (1) the preparation of pro forma
financial statements, including pro forma cost savings, synergies,
capitalization or other pro forma adjustments desired to be incorporated into
any financial statement or any pro forma financial statements, other
than providing the financial information expressly required as part of the
Required Financing Information, (2) any description of all or any component
of the Total Financing, including any such description to be included in any
liquidity or capital resources disclosure or any "description of notes", (3)
projections, risk factors or other forward-looking statements relating to all
or any component of the Total Financing, (4) financial statements or any other
information of the type required by Rule 3.09, Rule 3.10 or Rule 3.16 of
Regulation S-X or (5) any legal opinion or other opinion of counsel, or any
information that would, in Hertz's good faith opinion, result in a violation
of applicable Laws or loss of any attorney-client privilege or an expectation
of client confidence or any other rights to any evidentiary privilege.
Neither Hertz nor any Selling Entity shall be required to incur any liability
in connection with the Total Financing. No Acquired Subsidiary shall be
required to incur any liability in connection with the Total Financing prior
to the Closing. The pre-Closing boards of directors of the Selling Entities,
the Acquired Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and the directors,
managers, trustees and general partners of the Selling Entities and the
Acquired Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates shall not be required
to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments
pursuant to which the Total Financing is obtained unless they also constitute
members of the post-Closing boards, directors, managers, trustees or general
partners of the Acquired Subsidiaries. None of the Selling Entities, any
Acquired Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required
to execute any definitive engagement letters, financing documents, including
any credit or other agreements, pledge or security documents, or other
certificates, legal opinions or documents in connection with the Total
Financing prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that, and if any such Person does
agree to execute any such document prior to the Closing, the Buyer agrees
that the execution of any documents in connection with the Total
Financing shall be subject to the consummation of the Transactions at the
Closing and such documents will not take effect until the Closing occurs and
will not encumber the assets of the Selling Entities, the Acquired
Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates prior to the Closing (or, in the
case of any Selling Entity or any Affiliate thereof, other than an
Acquired Subsidiary, following the Closing) and will otherwise terminate
concurrently with the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms. Except as expressly provided above, none of the Selling Entities,
Acquired Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates shall be required to
take any corporate, limited liability company, trust or limited
partnership actions prior to the Closing to permit the consummation of the
Total Financing.

  



  

   

84

 



    



  

(b) In no event shall any Selling Entity, any Acquired Subsidiary or
any of their respective Affiliates be required to (i) pay any commitment or
similar fee or incur any Liability or expense (including due to any act or
omission by any Selling Entity, any Acquired Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives) in connection with assisting the
Buyer in arranging the Total Financing or as a result of any information
provided by any Selling Entity, any Acquired Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection
therewith other than as it relates to any Acquired Subsidiary to the
extent occurring and for periods after the Closing, (ii) take any action that
would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of applicable Law or
subject it to actual or potential Liability prior to the Closing (or, in the
case of any Selling Entity or any Affiliate thereof, other than an Acquired
Subsidiary, following the Closing), (iii) incur any Liability or any
obligation under any definitive financing document or any related document or
other agreement or document related to the Total Financing prior to the
Closing (or, in the case of any Selling Entity or any Affiliate thereof, other
than an Acquired Subsidiary, following the Closing), (iv) incur any other
Liability in connection with the Total Financing prior to the Closing (or, in
the case of any Selling Entity or any Affiliate thereof, other than an
Acquired Subsidiary, following the Closing) or (v) disclose or provide any
information the disclosure of which in the reasonable judgment of Hertz, the
Selling Entities or the Acquired Subsidiaries, is restricted by applicable
Law or Order. The Buyer shall (i) promptly upon request by Hertz or the Seller
reimburse all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Selling Entities, the Acquired Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates in
connection with such cooperation (including, without limitation, in
connection with the preparation of any audited financial statements in
order to obtain the Athene Debt Financing or Required Financing Information)
and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Selling Entities, the Acquired
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and Representatives from and
against any and all losses and Liabilities suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the Total Financing or providing any of the
information utilized in connection therewith, _provided_ , _however_ , that
this clause (ii) shall not apply in respect of the Selling Entities', the
Acquired Subsidiaries' and their respective Affiliates' and Representatives'
bad faith or willful misconduct, in each case as determined by a final and
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.

  



  

(c) The Selling Entities hereby consent, in coordination with them, to
the use of any Acquired Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Total
Financing so long as such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended or reasonably likely to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely
affect the Selling Entities, the Acquired Subsidiaries or any of the Selling
Entities' other Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of such Persons.

  



  

Solely for the purposes of this _Section 7.9_ , "Selling Entities" shall
include Hertz.

Section 7.10 _Employee Matters._

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Buyer shall make an offer of employment,
to commence as of the Closing, to each of the Employees (each such Employee,
an " _Offered Employee_ "); provided, however, that with respect to an
Employee on a leave of absence as of the Closing (an " _Inactive Employee_
"), such offer shall be for employment as of the date he or she is able to
again commence employment, but only to the extent such date is within six
months following the Closing. Each Offered Employee who receives and accepts
such an offer of employment with the Buyer (and commences employment) is
referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_ ", and the Buyer shall
employ each Transferred Employee in accordance with such accepted offer as of
the Closing. The Buyer hereby agrees that the offers to the Offered Employees
shall contain the terms set forth in _Section 7.10(a)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule (a " _Qualifying Offer of Employment_ ") and shall include, and for
the period immediately following the Closing through and including the twelve
(12) month anniversary of the Closing, the Buyer shall provide (i)
base salary or wage rates (as applicable) and target annual incentive
opportunities to each Transferred Employee and (ii) benefits (including
retirement, health, welfare, severance and other benefits, but excluding any
equity compensation and any defined benefit plan) for each Transferred
Employee, in each case of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ that are substantially
similar in the aggregate to the base salary, wage rates, target annual
incentive opportunities and benefits (including retirement, health,
welfare, severance and benefits, but excluding any equity compensation and
any defined benefit plan) provided to such Offered Employee immediately prior
to the Closing. With respect to employees of the Acquired Subsidiaries (the "
_Acquired Subsidiary Employees_ ", and together with the Transferred
Employees, the " _Continuing Employees_ "), the Buyer hereby agrees that it
will provide to the Acquired Subsidiary Employees base salary or wage rates
(as applicable), target annual cash incentive opportunities and benefits
through and including the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing that
are substantially similar in the aggregate to the base salary or wage rates
(as applicable), target annual cash incentive opportunities and benefits
provided to such employees immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

(b) Effective at or prior to the Closing, the Selling Entities shall
terminate the employment of each Offered Employee (other than an
Inactive Employee) who does not accept an offer of employment with the Buyer
prior to the Closing (a " _Terminated Employee_ "). The Buyer, Hertz and the
Selling Entities agree that the Transactions will not constitute a separation,
termination or severance of employment of any Continuing Employee for
purposes of the KERP and that each such Continuing Employee will have
continuous employment immediately before and immediately after the Closing
for purposes of the KERP; provided that such Continuing Employee accepts
Buyer's Qualifying Offer and does not resign from his or her employment with
the Buyer prior to March 31, 2020.

  



  

(c) In respect of the Continuing Employees and any Terminated Employee
who did not receive a Qualifying Offer of Employment (" _Non-
Offered Employee_ "), the Buyer shall be responsible for (i) any and all
Liabilities under the Assumed Plan and (ii) all current compensation,
deferred compensation reflected on _Section 7.10(c)_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, salary, wages, unused vacation pay, overtime pay, holiday pay, sick
days, personal days or leave earned and/or accrued through the Closing (other
than any such pay required to be paid under applicable Law by the Selling
Entities in connection with a termination of employment). In respect of the
Employees who will not become Continuing Employees (other than Non-Offered
Employees), including the Terminated Employees who received a Qualifying
Offer of Employment, the Selling Entities shall be responsible for (i) any and
all Liabilities to any such individuals, including Liabilities arising out of
such termination, (ii) all current compensation, all compensation
reflected on _Section 7.10(c)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, salary, wages,
unused vacation pay, overtime pay, holiday pay, sick days, personal days or
leave earned and/or accrued through the Closing, (iii) statutory, contractual,
and/or common law notice, pay in lieu of notice and/or any severance
obligations or Liabilities, including any obligations or Liabilities that
arise under any Seller Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan and (iv) any
Liabilities arising under an employee incentive or retention program
or similar arrangement. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, none of Buyer, its Affiliates or any
Acquired Subsidiary shall have any Liability or obligation with respect to any
Employee who does not become a Continuing Employee (other than a Non-Offered
Employee).

  



  

   

86

 



    



  

(d) Following the Closing, subject to the Transition Services
Agreement, the Buyer shall process the payroll for, and pay (or cause to be
paid), the base wages, base salary and ordinary course sales commissions
accrued during the payroll period in which the Closing Date falls (the "
_Closing Payroll Period_ ") with respect to each Transferred Employee and each
Acquired Subsidiary Employee employed at any time during the Closing Payroll
Period. The Closing Payroll Period shall extend from the final payroll date
preceding the Closing through and including the Closing Date. Subject to the
Transition Services Agreement, in connection therewith, the Buyer shall
withhold and remit, on behalf of the Selling Entities, all applicable Taxes,
including payroll taxes, as required by Law.

  



  

(e) At the Closing, the Seller shall furnish the Buyer with information
concerning the location, identity, date of termination and reason for
termination with respect to any Employee involuntary terminated during the
ninety (90) days immediately preceding the Closing.

  



  

(f) Continuing Employees shall receive credit for all purposes
(including for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit
accrual and eligibility to receive benefits (other than for benefit accrual
under any defined benefit plan)) under any Buyer Benefit Plan under which
each Transferred Employee and each Acquired Subsidiary Employee may be
eligible to participate on or after the Closing to the same extent recognized
by the Seller under comparable Parent Benefit Plan or Seller Benefit Plans as
of the date hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such crediting of service
shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such
benefit. With respect to any Buyer Benefit Plan that is a welfare benefit
plan, program or arrangement and in which a Transferred Employee or an
Acquired Subsidiary Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the
Closing, the Buyer shall, (i) waive, or use reasonable efforts to cause its
insurance carrier to waive, all limitations as to pre-existing, waiting period
or actively-at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to each Transferred Employee and each
Acquired Subsidiary Employee under such Buyer Benefit Plan to the same extent
waived under a comparable Seller Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan and (ii)
provide, or use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, credit to each
Transferred Employee and each Acquired Subsidiary Employee (and such
Transferred Employee's and such Acquired Subsidiary Employee's beneficiaries)
for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such
Transferred Employee or such Acquired Subsidiary Employee, as applicable (and
such Transferred Employee's or such Acquired Subsidiary Employee's
beneficiaries, as applicable) under the comparable Parent Benefit Plan or
Seller Benefit Plan during the relevant plan year, up to and including the
Closing; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such credit shall not operate to
duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit.

  



  

   

87

 



    



  

(g) Effective as of the Closing, (i) the Buyer agrees to assume and
honor, or to cause an Affiliate of the Buyer (including any one of the
Acquired Subsidiaries) to assume and honor, in accordance with their current
terms, sponsorship of, or the Liabilities under, each of the Seller Benefit
Plans and Parent Benefit Plans set forth on _Section 7.10(g)_ of the
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Assumed Plans_ "), (ii) the Buyer or an Affiliate
of the Buyer (including any one of the Acquired Subsidiaries) shall assume
or retain, as applicable, all Liabilities arising out of or relating to each
Assumed Plan and (iii) each Employee and each Acquired Subsidiary Employee
shall cease active participation in each Seller Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit
Plan that is not an Assumed Plan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, to the extent that any portion of any retention bonuses
paid pursuant to the retention bonus agreements set forth on _Section
7.10(g)_ of the Disclosure Schedule, are subsequently repaid by the
applicable individual who is a party to such agreement to the Buyer or any of
its Affiliates pursuant to the terms of the applicable retention bonus
agreement, within ten (10) Business Days following the date on which such
repayment occurs, Buyer shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to Seller an
amount equal to such repaid portion of such retention bonus amount. The Buyer
shall request that such amounts be repaid and shall promptly notify the
Seller of any event that would result in the repayment obligation of any
retention bonuses described in this _Section 7.10(g)._ For the avoidance of
doubt, neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any repayment
obligation unless and until it receives such repayment from a Continuing
Employee. Further, neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any
repayment obligation in respect of retention bonus amounts repaid by any
Continuing Employee directly to Seller.

  



  

(h) The provisions of this _Section 7.10_ are for the sole benefit of
the Buyer, the Selling Entities and nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person (including
for the avoidance of doubt any Employees or Transferred Employees), other
than the Buyer and the Selling Entities and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 7.10_ or under or
by reason of any provision of this Agreement). Nothing contained herein,
express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (ii) shall, subject to
compliance with the other provisions of this _Section 7.10_ , alter or limit
Buyer's or any Selling Entity's ability to amend, modify or terminate any
particular benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement or (iii) is
intended to confer upon any current or former employee any right to
employment or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this
Agreement, or any right to a particular term or condition of employment.

Section 7.11 _Tax Matters._

  



  

(a) Any sales, use, goods and services, harmonized sales, Quebec sales
tax, provincial sales, real property, property transfer or gains, gross
receipts, documentary, stamp, registration (including, without limitation, any
vehicle registration, titling, and other fees payable in connection with the
transfer of motor vehicles), recording or similar Tax payable in connection
with the sale or transfer of the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities and not exempted under the Sale Order or by Section
1146(a) of the Bankruptcy Code (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be payable and
borne by the Buyer. Buyer shall pay such Transfer Taxes to the applicable
Selling Entity or the relevant Governmental Authorities as it is required to
pay by applicable Law. Buyer shall provide evidence of payment of Transfer
Taxes to the Seller within ten (10) Business Days after any such payment is
made. The Buyer shall indemnify and reimburse any Selling Entity, its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives for the amount of any
Transfer Taxes that such Selling Entity is required to pay pursuant to
applicable Law or due to an audit and/or inquiry within ten (10) Business
Days after payment is made. The Selling Entities and the Buyer shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to reduce or
exempt the sale and transfer of the Purchased Assets from any such Transfer
Taxes, including a request (as part of the Sale Order) that the Selling
Entities' sale of the Purchased Assets be exempted from Transfer Taxes
pursuant to Section 1146 of the Bankruptcy Code, to the extent applicable. The
Buyer shall prepare all necessary Tax Returns or other documents with respect
to all such Transfer Taxes and deliver such Tax Returns to the Selling
Entities at least ten (10) days prior to their due dates. The Buyer shall
incorporate any reasonable comments and shall file such Tax Returns to the
extent permitted under applicable Tax Law. If a Transfer Tax Return reports
Taxes that are not Transfer Taxes and that are an Excluded Liability (a "
_Hybrid Tax Return_ "), such Hybrid Tax Return shall be subject to approval by
the Selling Entities (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned). If any of these Tax Returns are required under applicable
Law to be filed by Selling Entities, the Buyer shall deliver such Tax Returns
to the Selling Entities so that they are received no later than two (2) days
prior to their due date so that Selling Entities can timely file these Tax
Returns. With respect to an audit and/or inquiry made by any tax authority
regarding a Hybrid Tax Return, Buyer shall control the audit and respond to
any inquiries made by a taxing authority but Selling Entities shall, at their
own expense, be able to participate in such audit. Buyer shall not settle any
items for which Selling Entities are not indemnified by the Buyer without the
consent of such Selling Entity (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). Any payment (or reimbursement) of Transfer
Taxes other than Canadian Transfer Taxes made by the Buyer shall be treated by
the Buyer and the Selling Entities as additional Purchase Price, or in the
case of Canadian Transfer Taxes such amounts shall be amounts paid in addition
to the Purchase Price. Any payments of Transfer Taxes to a taxing authority
for Taxes that the Selling Entities are obligated to pay pursuant to
applicable law shall be treated as a deduction for the Selling Entities, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

(b) The Buyer shall be responsible for any GST/HST/QST (as defined
below) payable in respect of the transfer of the Purchased Assets. If
available and subject to the applicable Selling Entity's and Buyer's mutual
agreement, each applicable Selling Entity and the Buyer will jointly execute
an election under section 167 of the Excise Tax Act (Canada) and section 75 of
An Act Representing the Quebec Sales Tax such that no taxes imposed under
such Law (the " _GST/HST/QST_ ") will be payable in connection with the
transfer of the Purchased Assets by the applicable Selling Entity to the
Buyer. The Buyer shall file such elections within the time and in the manner
prescribed by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in the event that it is determined by a relevant Governmental
Authority that there is a liability of the Buyer to pay GST/HST/QST or the
Selling Entities to collect GST/HST/QST in respect of all or part of the
transaction hereunder, the Buyer shall indemnify and hold the Selling
Entities, their Affiliates and their respective Representatives harmless in
respect of any GST/HST/QST, penalties and interest which may be assessed
against the Selling Entities under the Excise Tax Act (Canada) or An Act
Respecting the Quebec Sales Tax as a result of the transaction under this
Agreement not being eligible for the elections or the failure of the Buyer to
file such elections in the manner and in the time prescribed by the Excise Tax
Act (Canada) or An Act Respecting the Quebec Sales Tax.

  



  

   

89

 



    



  

(c) If the parties agree, each applicable Selling Entity and the Buyer
will, if available, jointly execute an election under section 22 of the Tax
Act and section 184 of the Taxation Act (Quebec) with respect to the sale of
Accounts Receivable by such Selling Entity and shall designate therein the
portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Accounts Receivable under
_Section 3.4_ as consideration paid by Buyer for such Accounts Receivable.

  



  

(d) All real property, personal property, intangible property and other
similar ad valorem Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the Purchased Assets for a Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the
Selling Entities, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, based on the
number of days of such taxable period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period
and the number of days of such taxable period included in the Post-Closing
Tax Period. Seller shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Taxes
that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall be liable
for the proportionate amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-
Closing Tax Period. With respect to any other type of Tax assessed with
respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes (other than
franchise Taxes) attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date will be determined on a "closing of the books basis" as if
the relevant Acquired Subsidiaries' year ended on the Closing Date; provided,
however, that if the income or loss of Donlen Canada Fleet Funding LP is
allocated with respect to a Straddle Period based on a notional year-end on
the Closing Date as contemplated by _Section 5.1_ of the Disclosure Schedule
or pursuant to _Section 7.11(e)_ then such allocation shall prevail for
Canadian Income Tax purposes. For purposes of this _Section 7.11(d)_ , any
exemption, deduction, credit or other item that is calculated on an annual
basis will be apportioned on a per diem basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any franchise Taxes payable with respect to any Straddle Period will be
allocated to the period during which the income, operations, assets or
capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether
the right to do business for another period is obtained by the payment of such
franchise Tax.

  



  

(e) The Selling Entities and the Buyer shall request consent from the
CRA to have a fiscal period end of the Donlen Canada Fleet Funding LP be the
end of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and allocate its
partnership income or loss, as determined for purposes of the Tax Act (and
any corresponding provincial legislation), to the respective partners of
Donlen Canada Fleet Funding LP in accordance with the allocation provisions
of the Partnership Agreement. The Seller agrees that the Partnership
Agreement shall be amended to permit such a fiscal period of the Donlen
Canada Fleet Funding LP assuming that the CRA provides its consent to the
change of fiscal period. In the event that the CRA does not provide its
consent to such request, the Seller and the Buyer shall, acting reasonably,
enter into an agreement with respect to the allocation of the income or loss
of the Donlen Canada Fleet Funding LP: i) from the beginning of its fiscal
period that includes the Closing Date to the end of the day immediately
prior to the Closing Date and ii) from the beginning of the day on the
Closing Date until the end of its fiscal period. In that event, the parties
agree that the maximum amount of capital cost allowance deductible pursuant to
the Tax Act and any other discretionary deductions shall be claimed to the
full extent permitted pursuant to the Tax Act and, if applicable, subject to
proration for the number of calendar days in the portion of the fiscal period
prior to the Closing Date and the portion of the fiscal period beginning on
the Closing Date and that any expense, deductions and credits imposed or
realized on a periodic basis without regard to income, gross receipts,
payroll or sales shall be allocated notionally between the portion of the
fiscal period prior to the Closing Date and the portion of the fiscal period
beginning on the Closing Date, as applicable, based on the amount thereof
and the number of calendar days in each such portion of the fiscal period.

(f) The Selling Entities (or their shareholders, as the case may be)
shall have the sole authority to prepare and file, or cause to be prepared
and filed, any "consolidated", "unitary", "affiliated", "aggregated" or
"combined" Tax Return (including any amendments to such Tax Returns) with
respect to the Business or Purchased Assets that includes an Acquired
Subsidiary or any of its shareholders (each such Tax Return, a " _Seller
Consolidated Return_ "), and Seller shall have no obligation to provide to
the Buyer any Seller Consolidated Return for any taxable period. In addition,
the Selling Entities (or their Affiliates, as the case may be) shall have the
sole authority to control (including any responses, or settlements) regarding
any inquiries, Claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to
Taxes relating to a Seller Consolidated Return. Except as provided in
_Section 7.11(g)_ and _(h)_ , the Buyer shall not make any elections that
could affect Taxes or Tax assets reported on a Seller Consolidated Return. The
Buyer and the Selling Entities agree and acknowledge that the Transaction Tax
Deductions shall be reported in Pre-Closing Tax Periods (and otherwise treated
as attributable to Pre-Closing Tax Periods) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. The Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
treat any Transaction Tax Deductions (or any portion thereof) as occurring
after the Closing Date under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b) (or any
similar provision of state, local or non-U.S applicable Law), unless otherwise
required by applicable Law. Buyer shall have the sole authority to prepare
and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all other Tax Return that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Business, the Purchased Assets
and the Acquired Subsidiaries after the Closing Date; provided, however, to
the extent that any such Tax Return reports items that (i) are reflected on a
Tax Return of Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to applicable Law, or (ii) or
could increase the Tax liability of Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to this
Agreement (a " _Seller Return_ "), (i) such Seller Return shall be prepared
in accordance with past practice (except as required by applicable Law); (ii)
Buyer shall deliver a draft of such Seller Return to Seller for review and
approval, (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), on or before thirty (30) days prior to the due date for such Seller
Returns and (iii) Buyer shall not settle or otherwise compromise a matter
with a Taxing authority with respect to a Seller Return without the
approval of the Seller (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt, a Tax Return shall cease
to the treated as a Seller Return hereunder if items set forth therein could
no longer increase the Tax liability of Seller or any Affiliate pursuant to
applicable Law or pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(g) Buyer shall be entitled to make, in its sole discretion, an
election under Section 338 of the Code (and any corresponding
applicable provisions of state, local and non-U.S. Laws) (" _Section 338
Election_ ") for each Acquired Subsidiary, and the Selling Entities shall
take all steps necessary to effect such elections; provided that Buyer pays
any incremental Taxes of the Selling Entities and their Affiliates
attributable to the making of the Section 338 Election. The parties further
acknowledge and agree that, in connection with the sale of interests in the
Acquired Subsidiaries, the Selling Entities shall consider in good faith, at
the Buyer's option, making an election under Section 336(e) of the Code (and
any corresponding applicable provisions of state, local and non-U.S. Laws) ("
_Section 336(e) Election_ "); provided that Buyer pays any incremental
Taxes attributable to the making of the Section 336(e) Election. The Selling
Entities shall reasonably cooperate and provide such information as
reasonably requested by Buyer to determine the amount of any such incremental
Taxes. Such incremental Taxes shall be determined on a with and without basis
compared to the Taxes that would be owed by the Selling Entities or their
Affiliates as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if
no Section 338 Election or Section 336(e) Election, as the case may be,
were made. The Allocation described in _Section 3.6_ shall include
allocations among the assets of each Acquired Subsidiary for which a Section
336(e) Election or Section 338 Election is made.

  



  

   

91

 



    



  

(h) Buyer shall be entitled to make, or cause to be made, in its sole
discretion, (i) an election pursuant to Section 754 of the Code and any
corresponding applicable provisions of state, local and non-U.S. Laws) with
respect to each applicable Acquired Subsidiary, and (ii) an election under
Section 6226(a) of the Code (and any corresponding applicable provisions of
state, local and non-U.S. Laws), in the event that an audit or examination of
a Tax Return of an applicable Acquired Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period results in any adjustment in the amount of any item of income, gain,
loss, deduction, or credit of such Acquired Subsidiary or any partner's
distributive share thereof, or otherwise gives rise to any "imputed
underpayment" of Taxes (as defined in Section 6225 of the Code or any
corresponding applicable provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Laws), and the
Selling Entities shall take all steps necessary to effect such elections.

  



  

(i)  Each party agrees to furnish or cause to be furnished to the other
party, upon reasonable request, as promptly as practicable, such information
and assistance as is reasonably necessary for the filing of Tax Returns, the
making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit or
other proceeding by Governmental Authority and the prosecution or defense of
any Claim, suit or other proceeding relating to any Tax. Such information and
assistance shall include providing reasonable access to any of the books and
records of the Selling Entities and the books and records of the Acquired
Subsidiaries delivered to the Buyer at Closing or provided pursuant to
_Section 7.3(b)._ Access to books and records shall be afforded upon receipt
of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours.

  



  

(j) Any Tax sharing arrangement to which any Acquired Subsidiary is a
party shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date, and all payables and
receivables arising thereunder shall be settled, in each case, prior to the
Closing Date. After the Closing, no Acquired Subsidiary shall have any rights
or Liabilities thereunder or under any payables or receivables arising
thereunder.

  



  

(k) If the parties agree, each applicable Selling Entity and the Buyer
will, if available, jointly execute and file an election under subsection
20(24) of the Tax Act in the manner required by subsection 20(25) of the Tax
Act and under the equivalent or corresponding provisions of any other
applicable provincial or territorial statute, in the prescribed forms and
within the time period permitted under the Tax Act and under any other
applicable provincial or territorial statute, as to such amount paid by such
Selling Entity to the Buyer for assuming future obligations. In this regard,
the Buyer and the Seller acknowledge that a portion of the Purchased Assets
transferred by each relevant Selling Entity pursuant to this Agreement and
having a value equal to the amount elected under subsection 20(24) of the Tax
Act and the equivalent provisions of any applicable provincial or territorial
statute, is being transferred by such Selling Entity as a payment for the
assumption of such future obligations by the Buyer; and The Buyer and the
Seller will also execute and deliver such other Tax elections and forms as
they may mutually agree upon.

  



  

   

92

 



    



  

(l) Prior to the Closing Date, the Selling Entities agree that Donlen
Fleet Leasing Ltd. and Donlen Canada Fleet Funding Corporation on behalf of
Donlen Canada Fleet Funding LP shall prepare, execute and file the joint
election pursuant to the provisions of subsection 97(2) of the Tax Act and
any applicable provincial or territorial legislation in respect of the
transfer of property from Donlen Fleet Leasing Ltd. to Donlen Canada Fleet
Funding LP which transfer took place on December 31, 2019 (the  " _2019
Transfer_ "), in prescribed form, specifying such "agreed amounts" as
determined by Donlen Fleet Leasing Ltd. within the limits provided for in the
Tax Act. Donlen Fleet Leasing Ltd. and Donlen Canada Fleet Funding Corp.
shall provide draft copies of such Tax elections to the Buyer for review,
shall consider any reasonable comments from the Buyer thereon and shall
execute and file such Tax elections and amend any Tax returns already filed in
order to reflect the 2019 Transfer. Donlen Fleet Leasing Ltd. and Donlen
Canada Fleet Funding Corp. shall also file such other Tax elections or forms
relating to the 2019 Transfer as the Buyer and Seller agree to file.

  



  

(m) Hertz shall retain, be responsible for, and shall pay to the
appropriate taxing authority, all Liabilities for Taxes of any member of any
consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group of which any Selling
Entity or Acquired Subsidiary is or has been a member prior to the Closing
Date; provided that the Buyer shall not have any right to recover from Hertz
(and thus Hertz shall have no Liability to the Buyer) to the extent Hertz
does not comply with this covenant.

  



  

Section 7.12 _Submission for Bankruptcy Court Approval._

  



  

(a) The Selling Entities and the Buyer each acknowledges that this
Agreement and the sale of the Purchased Assets to the Buyer, the
assignment of the Assumed Agreements and Assumed Real Property Leases to the
Buyer and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by the Buyer are subject
to Bankruptcy Court approval. The Buyer acknowledges that (i) to obtain such
approval, the Selling Entities must demonstrate that they have taken
reasonable steps to obtain the highest and otherwise best offer possible for
the Purchased Assets (as further set out in _Section 7.13_ ), and (ii) the
Buyer must provide adequate assurance of future performance as required under
the Bankruptcy Code with respect to each Assumed Agreement and Assumed Real
Property Lease. Each of the Selling Entities shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to file and serve the Bidding Procedures
Motion (the " _Motion_ ") in agreed form, with such modifications or
amendments as may be mutually agreed to by the Buyer and the Selling Entities,
on or prior to the end of the first (1st) Business Day following the date
hereof. Each of the Selling Entities shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to have, subject to the availability of the Bankruptcy
Court, the Bidding Procedures Hearing occur and the Bidding Procedures Order
entered within 25 calendar days following the first (1st) Business
Day following the date hereof. Provided that the Buyer is selected as the
winning bidder in respect of the Purchased Assets at the Auction, if any, or
if no Competing Bid is submitted with respect to the Purchased Assets, each of
the Selling Entities shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to have the Sale Hearing occur and the Sale Order entered within the
later of (y) 60 calendar days following the entry of the Bidding Procedures
Order and (z) 85 calendar days following the date of this Agreement. The
Buyer agrees that it will promptly take such actions as are reasonably
requested by Hertz or the Selling Entities to assist in obtaining entry of
such Orders and a finding of adequate assurance of future performance by the
Buyer of the Assumed Agreements and Assumed Real Property Leases, including
furnishing affidavits or other documents or information for filing with the
Bankruptcy Court for the purposes, among others, of providing necessary
assurances of performance by the Buyer under this Agreement and demonstrating
that the Buyer is a "good faith" purchaser under section 363(m) of the
Bankruptcy Code. The Selling Entities shall give notice under the Bankruptcy
Code of the request for the relief specified in the Motions to all Persons
entitled to such notice, including all Persons that have asserted Encumbrances
or other interests in the Purchased Assets and all non-debtor parties to the
Assumed Agreements and the Assumed Real Property Leases, and other appropriate
notice, including such additional notice as the Bankruptcy Court shall direct
or as the Buyer may reasonably request, and provide appropriate
opportunity for hearing, to all parties entitled thereto, of all motions,
Orders, hearings, or other Proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions. The Selling Entities shall be responsible
for making all appropriate filings relating thereto with the Bankruptcy
Court, which filings shall be submitted, to the extent practicable, to the
Buyer no later than one (1) Business Day prior to their filing with the
Bankruptcy Court for the Buyer's prior review.

  



  

   

93

 



    



  

(b) Each Selling Entity and the Buyer shall provide notice as far in
advance as possible (but in no case less than two (2) Business Days before
filing) and consult with one another and Hertz regarding pleadings which any
of them intends to file with the Bankruptcy Court in connection with, or
which might reasonably affect the Bankruptcy Court's entry of, as applicable,
the Bidding Procedures Order or the Sale Order. Each Selling Entity shall
promptly provide the Buyer and its counsel with copies of all notices,
filings and Orders of the Bankruptcy Court that such Selling Entity receives
pertaining to the motion for approval of the Bidding Procedures Order or the
Sale Order or any other Order related to any of the Transactions, but only to
the extent such papers are not publicly available on the Bankruptcy Court's
docket or otherwise directly provided to the Buyer and its counsel.

  



  

(c) The proposed forms of the Bidding Procedures Order, the Sale Order,
and any other Orders of the Bankruptcy Court relating to this Agreement or
the Business to be filed by the Selling Entities shall be in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and Hertz and consistent with
the terms of this Agreement; _provided,_ that any amendments to the proposed
form of Sale Order attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ must be reasonably
acceptable to the Buyer only if (i) no Qualified Bids are received by the Bid
Deadline, (ii) the Buyer is selected as the winning bidder at the Auction or
(iii) the Buyer serves as the Back-Up Bidder.

  



  

(d) If the Bidding Procedures Order, the Sale Order, or any other
Orders of the Bankruptcy Court relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions shall be appealed by any Person (or if any petition for
certiorari or motion for reconsideration, amendment, clarification,
modification, vacation, stay, rehearing or reargument shall be filed with
respect to the Bidding Procedures Order, the Sale Order or other such Order),
subject to rights otherwise arising from this Agreement, the Selling Entities
and the Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to prosecute
such appeal, petition or motion and obtain an expedited resolution of any such
appeal, petition or motion.

  



  

   

94

 



    



  

Section 7.13 _Competing Bids; Overbid Procedures; Adequate Assurance._

  



  

(a)  The Buyer and the Selling Entities acknowledge that the Selling
Entities must take reasonable steps to demonstrate that they have sought to
obtain the highest or otherwise best price for the Purchased Assets, including
giving notice thereof to the creditors of the Selling Entities and other
interested parties, providing information about the Selling Entities' business
to prospective bidders, entertaining higher and better offers from such
prospective bidders, and, if additional qualified prospective bidders desire
to bid for the Purchased Assets, conducting an auction (the " _Auction_ "). In
connection with the Auction, the Selling Entities shall exercise their good
faith judgment to limit disclosure of competitively sensitive information to
direct current competitors of the Business and affiliates thereof by limiting
such disclosure until a prospective bidder has (i) submitted an indication of
interest that the Selling Entities determine is reasonably likely to result in
a Qualified Bid as set forth in the Bidding Procedures attached to the form
of Bidding Procedures Order, attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (as may be
amended upon the reasonable written consent of the Buyer) and (ii) completed a
substantial portion of its diligence of the Due Diligence Materials other
than competitively sensitive information.

  



  

(b) The bidding procedures to be employed with respect to this
Agreement and any Auction shall be those reflected in the Bidding
Procedures Order. The Buyer and each Selling Entity agrees that this
Agreement and the Transactions are subject to the right of the
Selling Entities, Hertz and their Affiliates and Representatives to seek,
solicit, invite, encourage, consider, discuss and negotiate, and to adopt or
approve, or execute or enter into, any binding Contract for, higher or better
Competing Bids in accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order. From the date
hereof and until (i) the completion of the Auction, which is to be completed
no later than the date that is eighty-five (85) calendar days from the date
hereof, or (ii) if no Qualified Bids are received by the Bid Deadline, the
Bid Deadline (such period being the " _Go-Shop Period_ "), the Selling
Entities, Hertz and their Affiliates are permitted to and are permitted to
cause their Representatives and Affiliates to, initiate contact with,
solicit or encourage submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers by, any
Person (in addition to the Buyer and its Affiliates and Representatives) in
connection with a Competing Bid or Alternative Transaction, including, to (and
to cause their Representatives and Affiliates to) respond to any inquiries or
offers to purchase all or any part of the Purchased Assets, (including
supplying information relating to the Business and the assets of the Selling
Entities to prospective purchasers) and to adopt or approve, or execute or
enter into, any binding Contract for, higher or better Competing Bids or
Alternative Transactions.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise permitted by this _Section 7.13_ , following
the Go-Shop Period and until the Closing or the earlier valid termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Selling Entities, Hertz and
their Affiliates are neither permitted to, nor permitted to cause their
Representatives and Affiliates to (i) initiate contact with, solicit or
knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any Competing Bid or any inquiry or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Bid or (ii)
participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or
cooperate in any way with any Person (whether or not a Person making a
Competing Bid) with respect to, any Competing Bid or any inquiry or proposal
that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Bid.

  



  

   

95

 



    



  

(d) If an Auction is conducted, and the Buyer is not the prevailing
bidder at the Auction but is the next highest bidder at the Auction and the
other Back-Up Bidder Conditions are satisfied, the Buyer shall serve as a
back-up bidder (" _Back-Up Bidder_ ") and keep the Buyer's bid to consummate
the Transactions on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (as
the same may be improved upon in the Auction) open and irrevocable, and the
Buyer shall not terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 9.1(b)(ii)_ or _(iv)_ or _9.1(d)(iii)_ , notwithstanding any right
of the Buyer to otherwise terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_
hereof, until the earlier of (i) the Outside Date or (ii) the date of the
consummation of an Alternative Transaction. Following the Sale Hearing and
prior to the Outside Date, if the prevailing bidder in the Auction fails to
consummate an Alternative Transaction as a result of a breach or failure to
perform on the part of such prevailing bidder, the Buyer (as the next highest
bidder at the Auction) will be deemed to have the new prevailing bid, and the
Selling Entities will be authorized, without further Order of the Bankruptcy
Court, to consummate the Transactions with the Buyer on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (as the same may be improved
upon in the Auction). For purposes hereof, the term " _Back-Up Bidder
Conditions_ " means the definitive agreement with the prevailing bidder as a
result of the Auction that satisfies the requirements of a "Qualifying Bid"
set forth in the Bidding Procedures attached to the form of Bidding
Procedures Order attached as Exhibit B hereto, disregarding any changes that
may be made to such Qualifying Bid requirements after the date hereof absent
the consent of Buyer.

  



  

(e) The Buyer shall provide adequate assurance as required under the
Bankruptcy Code of the future performance by the Buyer of each
Assumed Agreement and each Assumed Real Property Lease. The Buyer agrees that
it will, and will cause its Affiliates to, promptly take all actions
reasonably required to support a Bankruptcy Court finding that there has been
an adequate demonstration of adequate assurance of future performance under
the Assumed Agreements and Assumed Real Property Lease, such as furnishing
affidavits, non-confidential financial information and other documents or
information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court and making the Buyer' s
Representatives available to testify at a hearing to consider the Sale Order.
In addition to making the Cure Payments required to be paid by the Seller
and/or Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.5(e)_ , if any, subject to the other terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Buyer shall, from and after the Closing
Date, (i) assume all Assumed Liabilities of the Selling Entities under the
Assumed Agreements and Assumed Real Property Leases and (ii) satisfy and
perform all of the Assumed Liabilities related to each of the Assumed
Agreements and each Assumed Real Property Lease when the same are due
thereunder.

  



  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the right of any member
of the Parent Group to: (x) solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or
facilitate any chapter 11 plan of reorganization; (y) enter into, maintain or
continue discussions or negotiations with respect to any such plan of
reorganization or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or
facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations; and
(z) adopt, approve, recommend, or enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to or propose to adopt, approve, recommend, or enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to (publicly or otherwise) any such plan of
reorganization.

  



  

   

96

 



    



  

(g) The Selling Entities and the Buyer agree, and the Bidding
Procedures Motion shall reflect the fact, that the provisions of this
Agreement, including this _Section 7.13_ and _Section 7.14_ , are reasonable,
were a material inducement to the Buyer to enter into this Agreement and are
designed to achieve the highest and best price for the Purchased Assets and
Assumed Liabilities.

9.1(d)(vi))_ or by either Buyer or Hertz pursuant to _Sections 9.1(b)(iii)_ or
_(iv)_ , (ii) at the time of termination of this Agreement, the Buyer is not

later than five (5) days following the consummation of such Alternative
Transaction.

  



  

(e)  If at any time after the entry of the Sale Order, the Bankruptcy
Court determines that Hertz may terminate this Agreement to pursue an
Alternative Transaction in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties and this
Agreement is terminated, then Selling Entities shall pay the Termination Fee
and Buyer Expense Reimbursement Amount in accordance with and subject to the
terms of _Section 7.14(a)_ above.

  



  

(f)  If the Termination Fee or the Option Fee, as applicable, shall
become payable pursuant to this _Section 7.14_ , such payments (along with

the Option Fee, the Catch-Up Fee, if applicable) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Buyer against the Selling Entities and their
respective Affiliates, Representatives, creditors or shareholders with
respect to this Agreement and the Transactions (including such termination
and any breach of this Agreement).

  



  

(g)  Upon the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order, (x) the Selling
Entities' obligation to pay the Option Fee, the Termination Fee, Catch-Up Fee
and/or Buyer Expense Payment Amount pursuant to this _Section 7.14_ shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and (y) the Option Fee, the

compensate Buyer in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee or Option
Fee is paid, as applicable, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions,
which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

  



  

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event this
Agreement is terminated prior to the entry of the Bidding Procedures
Order, the Buyer reserves all of its rights to seek payment of all or a
portion of the Termination Fee, the Option Fee or Buyer Expense Payment
Amount as an administrative expense under section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy

any Acquired Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates regarding the
contemplated Transaction, except with the prior express written permission of

following the Closing.

  



  

Section 7.17 _Post-Closing Operation of the Seller; Name Changes._ As

Disclosure Schedule for non-commercial uses, including to factually
describe their prior ownership of the Business, for internal business
purposes, records and other historical or archived documents containing or
referencing such name or in a manner that constitutes fair use under
applicable Law. Any inadvertent non-permitted use of the  "Donlen" name and
the names and marks set forth in _Section 7.17_ of the Disclosure Schedule by
Selling Entities or their Affiliates after Closing shall not be a breach of
this _Section 7.17_ ; _provided_ , that within sixty (60) days of the Buyer
discovering or becoming aware of such use, the Selling Entities, or their
Affiliates, as applicable, cease such use or removes the "Donlen" name and

Section 7.18 _Wrong Pocket._

  



  

(a)  Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including _Section
2.5)_ and the other Transaction Documents, during the six (6)-month period
following the Closing, if either the Buyer or any Selling Entity becomes aware
that any right, property or asset forming part of the Purchased Assets has
not been transferred to the Buyer or that any right, property or asset not
forming part of the Purchased Assets has been transferred to the Buyer, it
shall promptly notify the such other parties hereto and the Buyer or the
Selling Entity, as applicable, shall, as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter, ensure that such right, property or asset (and any related
Liability) is transferred at the expense of the Selling Entities and with any
necessary Consent, to (i) the Buyer, in the case of any right, property or
asset forming part of the Purchased Assets which was not transferred to the
Buyer at or in connection with the Closing, or (ii) the Seller, in the case
of any right, property or asset not forming part of the Purchased Assets

other hand, each agree that, after the Closing, each will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, hold in trust for the other' s benefit

to time as and when received by such party or its Affiliates (or, with respect
to the Selling Entities, any member of the Parent Group), any cash, checks
with appropriate endorsements, payment of an Account Receivable or other
account, trade, note receivable or other payment or other property or assets
that such party or its Affiliates may receive on or after the Closing which

to the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, following the Closing, (i) if any

Parent Group or a Selling Entity, the Selling Entity shall, or shall cause the
applicable member of the Parent Group to, promptly remit by wire or draft

payments due with respect to the Retained Business are paid to the Buyer, the

Section 7.19 _Credit Support for Business._ Prior to the Closing,
the Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and Hertz and the
Selling Entities shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
in Buyer's efforts to procure, at the Buyer's expense, the return or
unconditional release by the applicable counterparty of each guarantee, letter
of credit, letter of comfort, performance bond, surety or other form of
credit support provided by or posted by (as applicable) any member of the
Parent Group (other than the Acquired Subsidiaries) with respect to any
Purchased Asset or any Assumed Liability (but excluding all Excluded
Liabilities), in each case, set forth on _Section 7.19_ of the Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Financial Assurances_ "), by providing substitute
guarantees, furnishing letters of credit, instituting escrow arrangements or
posting surety or performance bonds. For any Financial Assurance for which
the Buyer is not substituted in all respects for the applicable member of the
Parent Group effective as of the Closing, the Buyer shall continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts to effect such substitution and release
as promptly as practicable after the Closing, and the Selling Entities shall
continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in the Buyer's
efforts, in each case during the six (6)-month period following the Closing.
The Buyer further agrees that, to the extent the beneficiary or counterparty
under any Financial Assurance does not accept any such substitute arrangement
proffered by the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer or to the extent the
applicable member of the Parent Group is not fully and irrevocably released
and discharged, the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless such member of the
Parent Group and its Representatives for, any and all Liabilities and amounts
reasonably paid, including costs or expenses in connection with such Financial
Assurance, including expenses in maintaining such Financial Assurance,
whether or not any such Financial Assurance is drawn upon or required to be
performed, and shall in any event promptly reimburse such member of the Parent
Group to the extent any Financial Assurance is called upon and any member of
the Parent Group makes any payment or is obligated to reimburse the Person
issuing such Financial Assurance. The provisions of this _Section 7.19_ (i)
shall survive consummation of the Transactions, and (ii) are intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each member of the Parent
Group and their successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 7.20 _Intercompany Accounts._ Except for the Hertz
Customer Contracts or as provided on _Section 7.20_ of the Disclosure
Schedule, all intercompany agreements and accounts between any member of the
Parent Group (other than any Selling Entity and Acquired Subsidiary), on
the one hand, and any Acquired Subsidiary, on the other hand (each of which
is set forth on _Section 7.20_ of the Disclosure Schedule), shall be
terminated at or prior to the Closing, without any liability or ongoing
obligation to either the Buyer or the Acquired Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
or any member of the Parent Group, on the other hand, following the Closing

Closing, the Intercompany Loan Agreement).

Entities' and their respective Affiliates' sole obligation with respect to the
provision of any services with respect to the Business shall be as set forth

(a)  From and after the Closing, except as contemplated by
_Section 2.1_ , the Acquired Subsidiaries and the Business shall cease to be
insured by the Selling Entities' and their respective Affiliates' current and
historical claims-made insurance policies or programs, and neither the Buyer
nor its Affiliates shall have any access, right, title or interest to or in
any such insurance policies or programs (including to all Claims and rights
to make Claims and all rights to proceeds) to cover any Purchased Assets,
assets of the Acquired Subsidiaries or any loss arising from the operation of
the Business; _provided_ , that, from and after the Closing until the date
that is five years after the Closing Date (except in the case of current
director and officer insurance which is put into runoff after the date

carriers under any claims-made insurance policies of Hertz and the Selling
Entities and its respective Affiliates, set forth in _Schedule 5.15_ of the
Disclosure Schedules to continue to process any claims made thereunder by the
Business or Acquired Subsidiaries, to the extent such claims were made after
Closing which refer to pre-Closing wrongful acts. The Selling Entities or any
of their respective Affiliates may amend, at the Closing, any insurance
policies and ancillary arrangements in the manner they deem appropriate to
give effect to this _Section 7.22_ , provided, that nothing herein shall be
deemed to effect an assignment of any insurance policies that, pursuant to
their terms and conditions, may not be assigned without the insurer's consent.
From and after the Closing, the Buyer shall be responsible for securing all
insurance it considers appropriate for its operation of the
Acquired Subsidiaries and the Business.

runoff, continuing claims-made, and occurrence-based Insurance Policies with
respect to events that have occurred prior to the Closing Date related to the
Acquired Subsidiaries, the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities. The Selling Entities shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cooperate with the Buyer or its Affiliates to make the benefits of any
such Insurance Policies available to the Buyer (net of any Taxes payable by
the Selling Entities in connection with such recovery), in each case, at
Buyer's sole cost and expense (including, if and to the extent unpaid and
otherwise payable as a result of such recovery, any deductibles, self-insured
retentions or other out-of-pocket expenses required to be paid by the Buyer
or to the insurer in connection therewith, which costs and expenses shall be
reimbursed to the Selling Entities or their respective Affiliates, as
incurred), and shall remit (or, at Buyer's request, direct any such insurer to
pay directly to Buyer) any insurance proceeds actually obtained therefrom
(net of such Selling Entity's reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs and expenses of seeking such recovery, to the extent not otherwise paid
or reimbursed by the Buyer) to the Buyer or its designee. In the event the
Selling Entities receive insurance proceeds in respect of any such claims made
under this _Section 7.22_ , it shall promptly remit such proceeds to the
Buyer.

advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Closing, whether asserted or Claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, now

as the case may be, of the Acquired Subsidiaries in their capacity as such
(each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") as provided in the
Organizational Documents of an Acquired Subsidiary as in effect on the date
hereof, or in an agreement between any Indemnified Person and any Acquired
Subsidiary as of the date hereof, shall survive the Closing and shall continue
in full force and effect to the extent provided in the following clause.

as of the date hereof, for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Closing.

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of such Acquired Subsidiary shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.23._

  



  

(d)  The provisions of this _Section 7.23_ (i) shall survive
consummation of the Transactions, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his

the Acquired Subsidiaries. On and after the Closing Date, except as expressly
otherwise set forth in this _Section 7.25_ , the Buyer shall not and shall
not permit any Affiliate to use any Retained Business Mark to represent that
it is, or otherwise hold itself out as being, affiliated with the Parent
Group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent (i) the removal of the
Retained Business Marks within such sixty (60) day period would require
material cost or effort, and (ii) the Retained Business Marks are used solely
for internal purposes that are not customer-facing or public-facing, the
Buyer and its Affiliates may use additional one hundred and twenty (120) days
for such removal. Nothing in this _Section 7.25_ shall prohibit the Buyer or
any of its Affiliates from using any Retained Business Marks in text-only form
in any non-trademark use that is factually accurate, including (i) for
purposes of conveying to customers or the general public that the Business
is no longer owned by Seller, or (ii) to reference historical details
concerning or make historical reference to the Business solely for non-
commercial purposes. The Seller will not assert any Claims against the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates for trademark infringement resulting solely and
directly from the failure by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates, as
applicable, to mask, obliterate, or remove any Retained Business Marks during
the sixty (60) day removal period (or the one hundred twenty (120) day
extension) permitted by this _Section 7.25(a)._

  



  

(b)  The Buyer shall not be entitled to use any Retained
Business Marks together with the Purchased Assets or any other
trademarks, service marks, trade dress or logos on (i) any stationery or
other form of documentation produced or distributed after the Closing Date or
(ii) any advertising. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date and not
later than sixty (60) days thereafter, the Buyer shall cause the Business to
take all actions necessary to change any names under which it conducts
business to names that do not use any Retained Business Mark or any name
confusingly similar to a Retained Business Mark.

  



  

(c)  Retained Business Marks are vested in and shall remain
vested in the applicable member of the Parent Group and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Buyer shall not obtain
any right, title, or interest in, or to, Retained Business Marks. The Buyer
hereby acknowledges and agrees that neither it nor the Business nor any
Affiliate of the Buyer shall acquire any goodwill, rights or benefits arising
from any use of Retained Business Marks and that all such goodwill, rights and
benefits shall accrue absolutely to the applicable member of the Parent
Group.

  



  

Section 7.26 _Resignation. _ The Selling Entities shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to the Buyer at Closing any
resignations (effective as of the Closing) of the directors, managers and
officers of the Acquired Subsidiaries that are requested by the Buyer no
less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

Person as of the most recent completed financial year or (B) at least twenty
percent (20%) of the annual revenue of such business unit or Person as of the
most recent completed financial year so long as Hertz or the applicable
controlled Affiliate that owns or acquires such equity interests, sells or
disposes of such competing business by the later of within eighteen (18)
months after (x) of its initial ownership or acquisition and (y) the date that
the aggregate annual revenues of such Person or business unit from a business
that competes with the Business in the United States or Canada comprises at
least twenty percent (20%) of the annual revenue of such Person or business
unit as of the most recent completed financial year.

  



  

   

105

 



    



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
_Section 7.27(a)_ or _Section 7.27(b)_ , the covenants contained in _Section
7.27(a)_ and _Section 7.27(b)_ shall not apply to any successor or assignee

substantially all of Hertz's or any of its Subsidiaries' assets or
businesses.

law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of Buyer and Hertz, and

in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and Hertz, which joinder shall
include, among other things, the same representations and warranties by such
permitted assign as those of the Buyer set forth in _Article VI._ No

assignment by the Buyer to any of its Affiliates) of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, including, in the case of Hertz and the Selling Entities,

benefit, Claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, except that

valid under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law
in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of
this Agreement in such jurisdiction or affect the validity, legality or
enforceability of any provision in any other jurisdiction, and the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision shall be interpreted and applied so as to
produce as near as may be the economic result intended by the parties hereto.

incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to eliminate such invalidity, illegality or
incapability of enforcement and to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

case in respect of any cause, matter or thing relating to the Purchased
Assets, the Business or any action taken or failed to be taken by any Buyer
Releasee in any capacity related to the Purchased Assets or the Business
occurring or arising on or prior to the Closing Date (a " _Buyer Released
Claim_ "). Buyer agrees not to, and agrees to cause each other Buyer
Releasor, not to, assert any Buyer Released Claim against the Buyer
Releasees. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer hereby waives and releases,
and will cause each of the other Buyer Releasors to waive and release, any
Claim, remedy or right to seek contribution or other recovery that any of
them may now or in the future ever have against any Buyer Releasee under any
Environmental Law in connection with any Release of Hazardous Materials.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Buyer Releasor retains, and does not
release, its rights and interests under the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Hertz Customer Contracts, the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Transaction Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 10.7(b)_ , the liabilities and obligations released pursuant to this
_Section 10.7(b)_ shall not include any claims arising out of actions or
omissions occurring after the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 10.7(b)_ releases any claims that Buyer, its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates may have against the Debtors arising (i) prior to
the Petition Date or (ii) pursuant to post-petition financing facilities
approved by the Bankruptcy Court.

  



  

(c)  Without limiting anything in the foregoing, effective as of
the Closing Date, each of Hertz and the Selling Entities, on behalf of itself
and its respective officers, directors, equity holders (other than the equity
holders of Hertz), Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates, and each of their
respective successors and assigns (each a " _Seller Releasor_ "), hereby
releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Subsidiaries), and
each of its and their respective past, present or future officers, managers,
directors, equity holders, partners, members, Affiliates, employees, counsel
and agents (each, a " _Seller Releasee_ ") of, from and against any and all
Liabilities, actions, causes of action, Claims, demands, damages, judgments,
debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and description whatsoever, which
such Seller Releasor or its successors or assigns ever had, now has or
may have on or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever to the
Closing Date, in each case in respect of any cause, matter or thing relating
to the Transaction Documents and the Transactions, the Purchased Assets, the
Business, the Excluded Liabilities, the Acquired Subsidiaries occurring or
arising on or prior to the Closing Date (a " _Seller Released Claim_
"). Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, the Seller Releasors shall not
be deemed to have released any claim, defense, fact or circumstance, which
Hertz determines after the Closing is necessary or desirable to defend against
any claim brought by any director, officer, employee, contractor, or agent
(other than any current or former director, officer, employee, contractor
or agent of any Acquired Subsidiary) or to prosecute any claim against any
director, officer, employee, contractor or agent (other than any current or
former director, officer, employee, contractor or agent of any Acquired
Subsidiary) relating to the work such individual performed for Hertz or its
controlled Affiliates prior to the Closing. Each of Hertz and the Selling
Entities agrees not to, and agrees to cause the other Seller Releasors not
to, assert any Seller Released Claim against the Seller
Releasees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Seller Releasor retains, and
does not release, its rights and interests under the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Hertz Customer Contracts, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Transaction Documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 10.7(c)_ , the liabilities and obligations released pursuant to
this _Section 10.7(c)_ shall not include any claims arising out of actions or
omissions occurring after the Closing Date.

Section 10.8 _Submission to Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._

  



  

(a) Any action, Claim, suit or Proceeding arising out of, based upon or
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be brought solely in the
Bankruptcy Court (or any court exercising appellate jurisdiction over the
Bankruptcy Court). Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court (or any court exercising appellate
jurisdiction over the Bankruptcy Court) in respect of any action, Claim, suit
or Proceeding arising out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement or any
of the rights and obligations arising hereunder, and agrees that it will not
bring any action arising out of, based upon or related thereto in any other
court; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the Bankruptcy Cases is dismissed,
any action, Claim, suit or Proceeding arising out of, based upon or relating
to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be heard and determined solely in
the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware and any direct
appellate court therefrom). Each party hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such action,
Claim, suit or Proceeding, (a) any Claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the
failure to serve process in accordance with  _Section 10.3_ , (b) any Claim
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid
of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any Claim that (i) the suit,
action or Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii)
the venue of such suit, action or Proceeding is improper or (iii) this
Agreement or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or entered
into in connection herewith, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not
be enforced in or by such courts. Each party agrees that notice or the
service of process in any action, Claim, suit or Proceeding arising out of,
based upon or relating to this Agreement or any of the rights and obligations
arising hereunder or thereunder, shall be properly served or delivered if
delivered in the manner contemplated by _Section 10.3._

  



  

   

120

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Selling Entities
and the Buyer agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of
action, Claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Debt Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any
of the Transactions, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Third Party Debt Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District for
the Southern District of New York (and any appellate courts thereof).

  



  

(c)  EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, CLAIM, SUIT OR PROCEEDING (WHETHER BASED IN
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF, BASED
UPON OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR
PERFORMANCE HEREOF, IN EACH CASE, INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER, INVOLVING THE DEBT
FINANCING SOURCES OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEBT FINANCING.

  



  

Section 10.9 _Counterparts._ This Agreement, the agreements referred
to herein, and each other agreement or instrument entered into in connection
herewith or therewith or contemplated hereby or thereby, and any amendments
hereto or thereto, may be executed in one (1) or more counterparts, each of
which will be deemed to be an original of this Agreement or such amendment
and all of which, when taken together, will constitute one and the same
instrument, and to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
photographic, photostatic, facsimile, portable document format (.pdf), or
similar reproduction of such signed writing using a facsimile machine or
electronic mail shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine or electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact
that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of a facsimile machine or electronic mail as a defense to the
formation or enforceability of a contract and each such party forever waives
any such defense.

  



  

Section 10.10 _Incorporation of Schedules and Exhibits._ All Schedules
and all Exhibits attached hereto and referred to herein are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Agreement for all
purposes as if fully set forth herein.

  



  

Section 10.11 _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement (including all
Schedules and all Exhibits), the other Transaction Documents and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings among the parties with respect thereto.

  



  

   

121

 



    



  

Section 10.12 _Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages
would be inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the
parties hereto and the third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be
entitled to equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, including an
injunction or injunctions or Orders for specific performance to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including any Order sought by the Selling
Entities to cause the Buyer to perform its agreements and covenants contained
in this Agreement, including to cause the Buyer to enforce its rights under
the Athene Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter), in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity
as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Each party hereto
further agrees that no other party hereto or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
_Section 10.12_ , and each party hereto (i) irrevocably waives any right it
may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument, subject only to the immediately succeeding sentence, and
(ii) agrees to cooperate fully in any attempt by the other parties hereto in
obtaining such equitable relief. Each party hereto further agrees that the
only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for
equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement. If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined
to specifically enforce the obligations of the Buyer to consummate the Closing
pursuant to a Claim for specific performance brought against the Buyer and
has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged breach, then Selling
Entities or Hertz may enforce such award. In the event of a failure or
threatened failure of the Buyer to enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment
Letter or the Athene Debt Commitment Letter, Hertz and the Seller shall be
entitled to specific performance to cause the Buyer to enforce the terms of
the Equity Commitment Letter and the Athene Debt Commitment Letter (or any
financing agreements related thereto), as applicable. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties hereto hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior
to the Closing, Hertz and/or the Selling Entities shall be entitled to
specific performance to cause the Buyer to draw down the full proceeds of the
Equity Financing and the Athene Debt Financing and to cause Buyer to
consummate the Transactions and to effect the Closing in accordance with
_Section 4.1_ , on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement,
if, and only if, (A) all conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section
8.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing and which would be satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such
time) have been or will have been satisfied at the time when the Closing
would be required to occur pursuant to _Section 4.1_ , (B) the Buyer fails to
complete the Closing in accordance with _Section 4.1_ , (C) the Third Party
Debt Financing (including any Alternative Financing) has been or will be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing and Athene Debt Financing are
funded at the Closing and (D) Hertz has irrevocably confirmed in a written
notice to the Buyer that the Selling Entities are prepared to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10. 13 _Bulk Sales or Transfer Laws._ Each of the Buyer and the
Selling Entities hereby waives compliance by the Selling Entities with the
provisions of the bulk sales or transfer Laws of all applicable jurisdictions.

  

     



  

   

122

 



    



  

Section 10.14 _Disclosure Schedule._ It is expressly understood and
agreed that (a) the disclosure of any fact or item in any section of the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other
Section or subsection of this Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule to which
its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face, (b) the disclosure of any
matter or item in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgement that such matter or item is required to be disclosed therein,
or otherwise imply, that any such matter is material or creates a measure for
materiality for purposes of this Agreement, and (c) the mere inclusion of an
item in the Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has
resulted in and would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

Section 10.15 _Mutual Drafting; Headings; Information Made Available._
The parties hereto participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement and the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent. If an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, then this Agreement
will accordingly be construed as drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no
presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. The
descriptive headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement are
included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. To the extent this Agreement
refers to information or documents made available or to be made available (or
delivered or provided), the parties hereto shall be deemed to have
satisfied such obligation if such party or any of their respective
Representatives have made such information or document available
(or delivered or provided such information or document) physically or
electronically to the relevant parties (including, in the case of information
or documents to be made available to the Buyer or any of its Representatives,
by posting to, retaining in and thereby making available to the Buyer and its
Representatives through, the Datasite "Project Freedom" data room prior to
the execution of this Agreement).

  



  

Section 10.16 _Conflicts; Privileges._

  



  

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that the Parent
Group, the Selling Entities and the Acquired Subsidiaries have retained White
and Case LLP (" _W andC_") and McCarthy Tetrault LLP (" _MT_ ") to act as
their counsel in connection with the Transactions and the Bankruptcy Cases
(the " _Current Representation_ ") and that neither WandC nor MT has acted as
counsel for any other Person in connection with the Transactions and that no
other party to this Agreement or Person has the status of a client of WandC or
MT for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. The
Buyer hereby agrees that, following the Closing, each of WandC and MT may
represent any member of the Parent Group in any matter involving or arising
from the Current Representation, including any interpretation or application
of this Agreement or any other agreement entered into in connection with the
Transactions, and including for the avoidance of doubt any dispute between or
among Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Acquired Subsidiaries), on the one hand. and any member of the Parent Group
on the other hand, even though the interests of such member of the Parent
Group may be directly adverse to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Acquired Subsidiaries and any of their
Affiliates), and even though WandC or MT may have, prior to the Closing,
represented any Selling Entity, the Business or any Acquired Subsidiary in a
substantially related matter, or may be, following the Closing, handling
ongoing matters for the Selling Entities, the Buyer, or the Acquired
Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates. Additionally, the Buyer hereby
waives, on behalf of its and each of its Affiliates, any Claim they have or
may have that, WandC or MT has a conflict of interest arising out of any
representation described in this _Section 10.16(a)._ The Buyer further agrees
that, as to all communications between WandC or MT, on the one hand, and any of
any Selling Entity, any Acquired Subsidiaries to the extent such communication
with any Acquired Subsidiary is prior to the Closing, or any member of the
Parent Group, on the other hand, that directly relate to the Current
Representation, any attorney-client privilege or an expectation of client
confidence or any other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to such
member of the Parent Group (other than, following the Closing, Acquired
Subsidiaries), is retained by such member of the Parent Group and may be
controlled by such member of the Parent Group (other than, following the
Closing, Acquired Subsidiaries) and shall not pass to or be claimed by the
Buyer or, following the Closing, the Acquired Subsidiaries. The parties hereto
further agree that WandC and MT are third-party beneficiaries of this _Section
10.16._

  



  

   

123

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute arises between the
Buyer, on the one hand, and a third party other than any Selling Entity or
other member of the Parent Group, on the other hand, the Buyer may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Deal
Communications to such third party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer
may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of Hertz
(which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). If the Buyer or any of its respective directors, officers,
employees or other representatives is required by Law or Order or otherwise to
access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Deal Communications, the
Buyer shall, to the extent practicable and legally permissible, (i)
reasonably promptly notify Hertz in writing (including by making specific
reference to this _Section 10.16(b))_ , (ii) agree that Hertz may seek a
protective Order (at Hertz's sole cost and expense) and (iii) use, at Hertz's
sole cost and expense, commercially reasonable efforts to assist therewith.

  



  

Section 10.17 _Liability of Financing Sources._ None of the Selling
Entities or each of their respective stockholders, partners, members,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, controlling persons and agents
shall have any rights or Claims against any Debt Financing Source in
connection with this Agreement, the Third Party Debt Financing or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 10.17_ shall in any way limit or modify
the rights and obligations of the Buyer under this Agreement or any Debt
Financing Source's obligations to the Buyer under the Third Party Debt
Financing or any financing commitment in respect thereof.

list of the debtors and the last four digits of their federal tax
identification numbers is not provided herein. A complete list of such
information may be obtained on the website of the debtors' claims and

2 Where context requires, capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Motion.

   



  

   

 



    



  

THE COURT HEREBY MAKES THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF
LAW:3

  



  

A. This Court has jurisdiction to consider the Motion under 28
U.S.C. §§ 157 and 1334 and the _Amended Standing Order of Reference_ , dated
February 29, 2012 (Sleet, C.J.). This is a core proceeding under 28 U.S.C. §
157(b). Venue of these Chapter 11 Cases and this Motion is proper in this
District under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1408 and 1409.

  



  

B. The predicates for the relief requested by the Motion are
sections 105, 363, 365, 503, and 507 of the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules
2002, 6004, 6006, and 9014, and Local Rule 6004-1.

  



  

C. The relief granted herein is in the best interests of the
Debtors, their estates and other parties in interest.

  



  

D. The Debtors have articulated good and sufficient business
reasons for the Court to (i) approve the Bidding Procedures, (ii)
authorize entry into the Stalking Horse SAPA and approve the Termination
Payments, (iii) set the date of the Auction and the Sale Hearing, (iv)
approve the form and manner of notice of the Bidding Procedures, the Auction
and the Sale Hearing; and (v) approve the Assumption and Assignment
Procedures.

  



  



  

  

3 The findings, determinations, and conclusions set forth herein constitute
this Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Bankruptcy
Rule 7052, made applicable to this proceeding pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule
9014. To the extent any of the following findings of fact constitute
conclusions of law, they are adopted as such. To the extent any of the
following conclusions of law constitute findings of fact, they are adopted as
such.

    



  

   

 



    



  

E. The Debtors provided sufficient and adequate notice of (i) the
Motion, (ii) the proposed entry of this Order, (iii) the Bidding Procedures
and certain dates and deadlines related thereto, (iv) the Stalking Horse SAPA
and the Termination Payments; (v) reasonably specific identification of the
assets for sale and the expectation for the proposed Sale to be free and
clear of liens, claims, interests, and other encumbrances, with all such
liens, claims, interests, and other encumbrances attaching with the same
validity and priority to the sale proceeds, (vi) the Assumption and Assignment
Procedures, (vii) the Auction, and (viii) the Bidding Procedures Hearing.
Such notice is reasonably calculated to provide all interested parties with
timely and proper notice under Bankruptcy Rules 2002, 6004 and 6006, and no
other or further notice of, or hearing on, each is necessary or required.

  



  

F. The Debtors' proposed notices of (i) the Bidding Procedures,
(ii) the Stalking Horse SAPA, (iii) the Sale Transaction, (iv) the Sale
Hearing, and (v) the assumption and assignment of, and Cure Amounts (as
defined below) for, the executory contracts and unexpired leases to be
assumed and assigned to the Successful Bidder, are appropriate and reasonably
calculated to provide all interested parties with timely and proper notice of
each, and no further notice of, or hearing on, each is necessary or required.

  



  

G. The Bidding Procedures, substantially in the form attached
hereto, and incorporated herein by reference as if fully set forth in
this Order, are fair, reasonable and appropriate, were negotiated in good
faith by the Debtors and the Stalking Horse Bidder and represent the best
method for conducting a Sale of the Donlen Assets and maximizing the value
thereof for the benefit of the Debtors' estates.

  



  

H. The Bidding Procedures comply with the requirements of Local
Rule 6004-1(c).

  



  

   

 



    



  

I. The Debtors have demonstrated a compelling and sound business
justification for authorizing entry into the Stalking Horse SAPA
and approving the Termination Payments, both of which were negotiated in good
faith by the Debtors and the Stalking Horse Bidder, under the circumstances
and timing set forth in the Motion and the Stalking Horse SAPA.

  



  

J. The Termination Fee, the Buyer Expense Payment Amount, the
Option Fee, and the Catch-Up Fee to the extent payable under the
Stalking Horse SAPA, (i) shall be deemed an actual and necessary cost of
preserving the Donlen Debtors' estates within the meaning of section 503(b)
of the Bankruptcy Code, (ii) are of substantial benefit to the Donlen Debtors'
estates (iii) are reasonable and appropriate, including in light of the size
and nature of the Sale Transaction and the efforts that have been and will be
expended by the Stalking Horse Bidder, (iv) have been negotiated by the
parties and their respective advisors at arm's-length and in good faith, and
(v) are necessary to ensure that the Stalking Horse Bidder will continue to
pursue the proposed Sale Transaction. The Termination Fee, the Buyer Expense
Payment Amount, the Option Fee, and the Catch-Up Fee were material
inducements for, and a condition of, the Stalking Horse Bidder's entry into
the Stalking Horse SAPA. The Stalking Horse Bidder is unwilling to commit to
purchase the Donlen Assets under the terms of the Stalking Horse SAPA unless
the Stalking Horse Bidder is assured the Termination Fee, the Buyer Expense
Payment Amount, the Option Fee, and the Catch-Up Fee pursuant to the terms of
the Stalking Horse SAPA.

  



  

K. The form and manner of notice of the Bidding Procedures, the
Auction, the Assumption and Assignment of Assigned Contracts and the
Sale Hearing are reasonable, appropriate, and sufficient.

  



  

L. The Assumption and Assignment Procedures are reasonable and
appropriate.

  



  

   

 



    



  

M. Entry of this Order is in the best interests of the Debtors'
estates, their creditors and all other interested parties.

  



  

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED THAT:

  



  

1. The Motion and the relief requested therein is GRANTED and APPROVED, as set forth herein.

  



  

2. All objections that have not been withdrawn, waived, or settled, or not otherwise resolved pursuant to the terms hereof, if any, are hereby DENIED and OVERRULED on the merits with prejudice. All withdrawn objections are deemed withdrawn with prejudice.

  



  

 _The Bidding Procedures_

  



  

3. The Bidding Procedures, as attached hereto as _Schedule 1_ , are approved and incorporated herein by reference. The Debtors are authorized to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to implement the Bidding Procedures. The failure to specifically include a reference to any particular provision of the Bidding Procedures in this Order shall not diminish or impair the effectiveness of such provision.

  



  

 _Notice of the Sale Transaction and the Sale Hearing_

  



  

4. Within three (3) business days after the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order, or as soon thereafter as practicable (the "Mailing Date"), the Debtors (or their agents) shall serve the Stalking Horse SAPA (as defined herein), the Bidding Procedures Order and the Bidding Procedures attached thereto, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, upon (i) the U.S. Trustee; (ii) counsel to the Committee; (iii) counsel to the lenders under the DIP Facility; (iv) counsel to the First Lien Agent; (v) counsel to the Ad Hoc Group of First Lien Term Lenders; (vi) counsel to the Second Lien Agent; (vii) counsel to the Ad Hoc Group of Second Lien Lenders; (viii) counsel to the Ad Hoc Group of Unsecured Noteholders; (ix) the indenture trustee under the HFLF ABS Notes; (x) the lender under the Donlen Canada Securitization Program; (xi) the Syndication Investors; (xii) any known affected creditor(s) asserting a lien, claim, or encumbrance against, or interest in, the relevant assets; (xiii) any party that has expressed an interest to the Debtors in purchasing the Donlen Assets during the last twelve (12) months; (xiv) the Internal Revenue Service; (xv) the Securities and Exchange Commission; (xvi) United States Attorney for the District of Delaware; (xvii) the state attorneys general for all states in which the Debtors conduct business; and (xviii) any such other party entitled to receive notice pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2002.

  



  

   

 



    



  

5. On the Mailing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Debtors (or their agents) shall serve by first-class mail, postage prepaid, the Sale Notice, substantially in the form attached to this Order as _Schedule 2_ , upon the parties identified in paragraph 4 above and all other known creditors of the Donlen Debtors. Such notice, along with the Assumption and Assignment Notice, shall be sufficient and proper notice of the Sale Transaction with respect to known interested parties.

  



  

6. On the Mailing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Debtors shall publish the Sale Notice in _The Wall Street Journal _ (National Edition), _The New York Times_ , _USA Today_ , and _The Globe and Mail_. Such publication notice shall be deemed sufficient and proper notice of the Sale Transaction to any other interested parties whose identities are unknown to the Debtors.

  



  

 _The Auction_

  



  

7. The Debtors are authorized to conduct an auction (the "Auction") with respect to the Donlen Assets. To the extent one or more Qualified Bids (as such term is defined in the Bidding Procedures) are received (in addition to the Stalking Horse Bid), the Auction shall take place on or before February 12, 2021 at 10:30 a.m. (prevailing Eastern Time) in a virtual room hosted by the Debtors' counsel, or such other place and time as the Debtors shall notify all Qualified Bidders, including the Stalking Horse Bidder and its counsel, and the Consultation Parties (as such term is defined in the Bidding Procedures). The Debtors are authorized, subject to the terms of this Order and the Bidding Procedures, to take actions necessary, in the reasonable discretion of the Debtors, to conduct and implement the Auction.

  



  

   

 



    



  

8. Except as otherwise determined by the Debtors, only (i) the Debtors, (ii) the Consultation Parties, (iii) the Stalking Horse Bidder, (iv) any other Qualified Bidder, (v) any creditor of Donlen Debtors that at least five business days prior to the auction delivers to Debtors' counsel a written request to attend the Auction (by email to livy.mezei@whitecase.com), and (vi) in each case, along with their representatives and counsel, shall attend the Auction (such attendance to be virtual);  _provided_ , that the Debtors may, in their sole discretion, establish a reasonable limit on the number of advisors that may appear on behalf of each party. Only the Stalking Horse Bidder and such other Qualified Bidders will be entitled to make any Bids at the Auction.

  



  

9. The Debtors and their professionals shall direct and preside over the Auction and the Auction shall be transcribed and shall be conducted openly. Each Qualified Bidder participating in the Auction, including the Stalking Horse Bidder, must confirm on the record that it (i) has not engaged in any collusion with respect to the bidding or sale of any of the assets described herein, (ii) has reviewed, understands and accepts the Bidding Procedures and (iii) has consented to the core jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the Sale, including the Bidding Procedures, the Auction, the Stalking Horse SAPA, any Competing Transaction, any Modified SAPA, or the construction and enforcement of documents relating to any Competing Transaction (as described more fully below).

  



  

   

 



    



  

10. Debtor Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. ("Hertz") may, as it reasonably determines is in the best interest of the estates: (i) determine which bidders are Qualified Bidders; (ii) determine which Bids are Qualified Bids; (iii) determine which Qualified Bid is the highest or best proposal and which is the next highest or best proposal; (iv) reject any Bid that is (a) inadequate or insufficient, (b) not in conformity with the requirements of the Bidding Procedures or the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code or (c) contrary to the best interests of the Debtors and their estates; (v) waive terms and conditions set forth herein with respect to all potential bidders; (vi) impose additional terms and conditions with respect to all potential bidders; (vii) extend the deadlines set forth herein; (viii) continue or cancel the Auction and/or Sale Hearing by filing a notice or in open court without further notice; and (ix) modify the Bidding Procedures and implement additional procedural rules that Hertz determines, in its business judgment, will better promote the goals of the bidding process and discharge its fiduciary duties and are not inconsistent with any order of this Court.

  



  

11. For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the Bidding Procedures, the Stalking Horse SAPA shall be deemed a Qualified Bid in all respects, the Stalking Horse Bidder shall be deemed a Qualified Bidder, and the Stalking Horse Bidder shall not be required to provide additional information or due diligence access to the Debtors to participate in the Auction. Any modification, amendments or waivers of the Bidding Procedures pursuant to Paragraph 10 above shall not affect the rights of the Stalking Horse Bidder under the Stalking Horse SAPA, including with respect to the Termination Payments.

  



  

   

 



    



  

12. The Good Faith Deposits of all Qualified Bidders, including the Stalking Horse Bidder, shall be held in one or more interest-bearing escrow accounts by the Debtors, but shall not become property of the Debtors' estates absent further order of the Bankruptcy Court. The Good Faith Deposit of any Qualified Bidder, including the Stalking Horse Bidder, that is neither the Successful Bidder nor the Back-Up Bidder shall be returned to such Qualified Bidder not later than five (5) Business Days after the Sale Hearing. The Good Faith Deposit of the Back-Up Bidder, if any, shall be returned to the Back-Up Bidder (or retained by the estates) upon the termination of such Back-Up Bidder's Modified SAPA or Stalking Horse SAPA, as the case may be, in accordance with its terms. Upon any return of the Good Faith Deposits, their respective owners shall receive any and all interest that will have accrued thereon. If the Successful Bidder timely closes the transaction contemplated in the Successful Bid, its Good Faith Deposit shall be credited towards the purchase price.

  



  

13. The failure to specifically include or reference any particular provision or section of the Bidding Procedures in this Order shall not diminish or impair the effectiveness or such procedures, it being the intent of this Court that the Bidding Procedures be authorized and approved in their entirety.

  



  

14. As soon as possible after the conclusion of the Auction the Debtors shall file a notice identifying any Successful Bidder and Back-Up Bidder, a copy of the Successful Bid and Back-Up Bid and the deadline for objecting to the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts (if the Stalking Horse Bidder is not the Successful Bidder) and the date and time of the Sale Hearing (the "Post Auction Notice").

  



  

   

 



    



  

 _The Termination Payments_

  



  

15. The Termination Fee, the Buyer Expense Payment Amount, the Option Fee, and the Catch-Up Fee set forth in the Stalking Horse SAPA are hereby approved and shall be paid to the Stalking Horse Bidder on the terms and conditions set forth in Section 7.14 and any other relevant provisions of the Stalking Horse SAPA.

  



  

16. Pursuant to Bankruptcy Code sections 105, 363, 503, and 507, the Donlen Debtors are hereby authorized to pay the Buyer Expense Payment Amount, the Termination Fee, the Option Fee, and the Catch-Up Fee pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Stalking Horse SAPA. Upon entry of this Order, the Termination Fee, the Buyer Expense Payment Amount, the Option Fee, and the Catch-Up Fee shall constitute an administrative expense of the Donlen Debtors with priority over any and all administrative expenses of the kind specified in sections 503(b) and 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and senior to all other superpriority administrative expenses in the cases of such Donlen Debtors; _provided_ that the Termination Fee, Buyer Expense Payment Amount, the Option Fee, and the Catch-Up Fee shall be immediately junior to (i) any carve-out granted pursuant to the DIP Order4 or the Donlen ABS Financing Order,5 (ii) any superpriority administrative Claims granted to the secured parties pursuant to the DIP Order, (iii) the Casualty Superpriority Claims,6 (iv) the Prepetition Secured Parties' 507(b) Claims, and (v) any administrative claim under the Donlen ABS Financing Order. The Donlen Debtors are authorized to pay the Termination Fee, Buyer Expense Payment Amount, the Option Fee, and the Catch-Up Fee when specified by the Stalking Horse SAPA without further authorization or order from this Court.

  



  

  



  

    

4 The  "DIP Order" is the _Order (I) Authorizing the Debtors to Obtain
Debtor-in-Possession Financing and Granting Liens and Superpriority
Administrative Claims and (II) Granting Related Relief_ [Dkt No. 1661].

  



  

5 The  "Donlen ABS Financing Order" is the _Order (I) Authorizing Certain
Debtors to Enter Into Securitization Documents, (II) Modifying the Automatic
Stay, and (III) Granting Related Relief_ [Dkt. No. 1489].

  



  

6 The  "Casualty Superpriority Claims" has the meaning ascribed to such
term in the _Order Temporarily Resolving Certain Matters Related to the
Master Lease Agreement, Setting a Schedule for Further Litigation Related
Thereto in 2021 and Adjourning Hearing on_ The Debtors' Motion for Order
Rejecting Certain Unexpired Vehicle Leases Effective Nunc Pro Tunc to
June 11, 2020 Pursuant to Sections 105 and 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code
[Docket No. 390] _Sine Die_ [Dkt. No. 805].

   



  

   

 



    



  

17. If the Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to Section 7.14 of the Stalking Horse SAPA, such payments (along with the Buyer Expense Payment Amount and return of the Deposit) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Stalking Horse Bidder against the Donlen Debtors and their respective Affiliates, Representatives, creditors or shareholders with respect to the Stalking Horse SAPA and the Sale Transaction (including the termination and any breach of the Stalking Horse SAPA).

  



  

 _The Sale Hearing and Objections to the Sale Transaction_

  



  

18. The hearing to approve the sale of the Donlen Assets to the Successful Bidder shall be held on February 17, 2021 at 10:30 a.m. (prevailing Eastern Time) (the "Sale Hearing").

  



  

19. Objections, if any, to the Sale Transaction (a "Sale Objection") other than Cure Objections and Adequate Assurance Objections (each as defined below), including any objection to the sale of any Assets free and clear of liens, claims, interests, and encumbrances pursuant to section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code to a Successful Bidder and/or a Backup Bidder, as applicable, and the entry of any Sale Order, must (a) be in writing and specify the nature of such objection, (b) comply with the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules, Local Rules, and all orders of this Court, and (c) be filed with the Court and served on (i) counsel to the Debtors, White and Case LLP, 200 South Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 4900, Miami, FL 33131 Attn: Thomas E Lauria (tlauria@whitecase.com), Matthew Brown (mbrown@whitecase.com), and White and Case LLP, 555 S. Flower St., Suite 2700, Los Angeles, CA 90071, Attn: Aaron Colodny (aaron.colodny@whitecase.com) and (ii) counsel to the Stalking Horse Bidder, Sidley Austin LLP, One South Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois 60603, Attn: Dennis M. Twomey (dtwomey@sidley.com), Allison Stromberg (astromberg@sidley.com) so as to be received on or before February 10, 2021 at 4:00 p.m. (prevailing Eastern Time) (the "Sale Objection Deadline").

  



  

   

 



    



  

20. If any party fails to timely file with the Court and serve on Debtors' counsel a Sale Objection by the Sale Objection Deadline, such party shall be barred from asserting, at the Sale Hearing or otherwise, any objection (other than a Cure Objection or an Adequate Assurance Objection) to the relief requested in the Motion, or to the consummation and performance of the Sale Transaction, including the transfer of the Donlen Assets to the Successful Bidder, free and clear of all liens, claims, interests and Encumbrances pursuant to section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, and shall be deemed to "consent" for the purposes of section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code.

  



  

21. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, the deadline to file a Cure Objection or an Adequate Assurance Objection (each as defined below) in connection with a proposed Sale Transaction to a Successful Bidder or to the Back-Up Bidder shall be as set forth below.

  



  

 _Assumption and Assignment Procedures_

  



  

22. The Assumption and Assignment Procedures are APPROVED.

  



  

23. The Assumption and Assignment Notice attached hereto as _Schedule 3_ is approved and fully incorporated into this Order. The failure to specifically include a reference to any particular provision of the Assumption and Assignment Notice shall not diminish or impair the effectiveness of such provision.

  



  

   

 



    



  

24. On or before December 21, 2020, the Debtors shall file with this Court and serve on each party to an Assigned Contract a Cure Notice that shall (i) identify the Assigned Contracts; (ii) state the cure amounts that the Debtors believe are necessary to assume such Assigned Contracts pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Cure Amount"); (iii) notify the non-debtor party that such party's contract or lease may be assumed and assigned to a purchaser of the Donlen Assets at the conclusion of the Auction; (iv) state the date of the Sale Hearing and that objections to any Cure Amount or to assumption and assignment of the contracts identified on the Cure Notice will be heard at the Sale Hearing or at a later hearing, as determined by the Debtors and the Successful Bidder; (v) state that the proposed assignee has demonstrated its ability to comply with the requirements of adequate assurance of future performance under section 365(f)(2)(B) and, if applicable, section 365(b)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code, including, without limitation, the assignee's financial wherewithal and willingness to perform under such executory contract or unexpired lease (such information, the "Adequate Assurance Information"); and (vi) state the deadline by which the applicable Contract Notice Party must file an objection to the Cure Amount or to the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts; _provided_ , _however_ , that the inclusion of a contract, lease or agreement on the Assumption and Assignment Notice shall not constitute an admission that such contract, lease or agreement is an executory contract or lease.7 The Debtors may file supplemental notices with respect to additional Assigned Contracts or removing Assigned Contracts that were included on previously filed Assumption and Assignment Notice until the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Sale Hearing. The objection deadline with respect to any such Assumption and Assignment Notice shall be the earlier of (i) fourteen days after service of the supplemental notice or (ii) the date of the Sale Hearing.

  

    



  

  



  

  

7 For the avoidance of doubt, the Debtors reserve all of their rights,
claims, and causes of action with respect to the contracts, leases, and
agreements listed on the Assumption and Assignment Notice.

  



  

   

 



    



  

25. Upon written request by a counterparty (an "Adequate Assurance Information Request"), Adequate Assurance Information shall be provided to such counterparty on a confidential basis. Any objection filed with the Court that includes confidential, non-public Adequate Assurance Information must and is hereby authorized to be filed under seal unless disclosure of such confidential, non-public information is authorized by the Debtors and the applicable assignee or assignees. The party filing such an objection under seal shall follow the procedures set forth in Local Rule 9018-1(d). Unredacted versions of such objections shall be served upon the Debtors, the Committee, the U.S. Trustee and the applicable assignee or assignees, with a copy to the Court's chambers.

  



  

26. Except as provided in paragraph 24 hereof or otherwise specified in the applicable Cure Notice, any objection to the Cure Amount (a "Cure Objection") or to assumption and assignment of an Assigned Contract to the Stalking Horse Bidder must (a) be in writing and specify the nature of such objection, (b) state with specificity what cure amount the party to the Assigned Contract believes is required if different than the amount listed in the applicable Cure Notice (in all cases with appropriate documentation in support thereof), and (c) be filed with the Court and served on: (i) counsel to the Debtors, White and Case LLP, 200 South Biscayne Boulevard, Suite 4900, Miami, FL 33131 Attn: Thomas E Lauria (tlauria@whitecase.com), Matthew Brown (mbrown@whitecase.com), and White and Case LLP, 555 S. Flower St., Suite 2700, Los Angeles, CA 90071, Attn: Aaron Colodny (aaron.colodny@whitecase.com) and (ii) counsel to the Stalking Horse Bidder, Sidley Austin LLP, One South Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois 60603, Attn: Dennis M. Twomey (dtwomey@sidley.com) and Allison Stromberg (astromberg@sidley.com), so as to be received on or before fourteen calendar days following the service of the Assumption and Assignment Notice (prevailing Eastern Time) (the  "Cure Objection Deadline"). If a Successful Bidder that is not the Stalking Horse Bidder prevails at the Auction, then counterparties may submit a new Adequate Assurance Information Request to the Debtors and the deadline to object to assumption and assignment based on adequate assurance of future performance (an "Adequate Assurance Objection") by such Successful Bidder shall be extended to the date that is one (1) Business Day before the Sale Hearing; _provided_ , _however_ , that all Cure Objections must be filed by the Cure Objection Deadline regardless of whether the Stalking Horse Bidder is the Successful Bidder.

  



  

   

 



    



  

27. The Debtors and any counterparty that files an objection to the applicable Cure Amount shall first confer in good faith to attempt to resolve the applicable Cure Objection without Court intervention. If a timely Cure Objection cannot otherwise be resolved by the parties, the Cure Objection may be heard at the Sale Hearing or, at the option of the Debtors, in consultation with the Successful Bidder, be adjourned to a subsequent hearing (each such Cure Objection, an "Adjourned Cure Objection"). An Adjourned Cure Objection may be resolved after the closing date of the Sale Transaction; _provided_ , that, with respect to any disputed Cure Amounts asserted in a timely filed Cure Objection, the Debtors shall, within ten (10) Business Days after the entry of the Sale Order, establish or cause to be established a cash reserve in an amount sufficient to pay the disputed Cure Amounts in full.

  



  

28. Any non-Debtor counterparty to any executory contract or unexpired lease, including an unexpired real property lease, that does not timely file an objection to the Cure Amount or the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts by the applicable objection deadline shall be (i) deemed to have consented to, and shall be forever barred from objecting to (a) the Cure Amount set forth in the applicable Assumption and Assignment Notice, and (b) the assumption and assignment, and (ii) forever barred and estopped from asserting or claiming any Cure Amount, other than the Cure Amount listed on the applicable Assumption and Assignment Notice, against the Debtors, any Successful Bidder or any other assignee of the relevant contract.

  



  

   

 



    



  

29. To the extent that a non-Debtor counterparty to an Assigned Contract was not provided with a Cure Notice (any such contract or lease a "Previously Omitted Contract"), the Debtors will notify the Successful Bidder within three Business Days (as defined in the Stalking Horse SAPA) of the omission. The Debtors shall serve a notice (the "Previously Omitted Contract Notice") to the counterparties to the Previously Omitted Contract indicating the Debtors' intent to assume and assign the Previously Omitted Contract. The counterparties will have fourteen (14) calendar days to object to the Cure Amount or the assumption and assignment. If the parties cannot agree on a resolution, the Debtors will seek an expedited hearing before the Court to determine the Cure Amount and approve the assumption and assignment. If there is no objection, then the counterparties will be deemed to have consented to the assumption and assignment and the Cure Amount, and such assumption and assignment and the Cure Amount shall be deemed approved by the Sale Order without further order of this Court.

  



  

30. Except as set forth in paragraphs 27 and 29, above, all objections to the proposed assumption and assignment of the Debtors' right, title, and interest in, to, and under a Contract, if it is ultimately designated as a proposed Assigned Contract, will be heard at the Sale Hearing.

 _BIDDING PROCEDURES_

  



  

On May 22, 2020, the above-captioned debtors and debtors in possession
(collectively, the "Debtors") filed voluntary petitions for relief under
chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") in
the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the
"Bankruptcy Court").

  



  

On [•], the Bankruptcy Court entered the _Order (I) Establishing Bidding
Procedures Relating to the Sale of Substantially All of the Assets of Donlen
Corp. and its Debtor Subsidiaries; (II) Approving the Termination Payments;
(III) Establishing Procedures Relating to the Assumption and Assignment of
Certain Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, Including Notice Of Proposed
Cure Amounts; (IV) Approving Form and Manner of Notice of All Procedures,
Protections, Schedules, and Agreements; and (V) Scheduling a Hearing to
Consider the Proposed Sale; and (VI) Granting Related Relief_ [Dkt. No. [•]]
(the "Bidding Procedures Order"),2 by which the Bankruptcy Court approved the
following Bidding Procedures.

  



  

The Bidding Procedures set forth the process to determine the highest or
otherwise best offer for the sale of substantially all the assets (the
"Donlen Assets") of Donlen Corporation ("Donlen Corp.") and its Debtor
subsidiaries (together with Donlen Corp., the "Donlen Debtors").

  



  

To facilitate a sale of the Donlen Assets (the "Sale" or "Sale Transaction")
and after engaging in a marketing process, Donlen Corp. and certain of its
subsidiaries, as sellers, selected the bid (the "Stalking Horse Bid") of
Freedom Acquirer LLC (the  "Stalking Horse Bidder") as the initial stalking
horse bid for the Donlen Assets. The Stalking Horse Bidder has executed that
certain Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (as amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified by the parties thereto, and including the disclosure
schedules and exhibits attached thereto, the "Stalking Horse SAPA"), dated
November 25, 2020 entered into by and among certain of the Debtors, the
Stalking Horse Bidder pursuant to which the Stalking Horse Bidder has agreed
to effectuate the Sale Transaction, which includes the purchase of the
Purchased Assets (as defined in the Stalking Horse SAPA)3 and the assumption
of certain liabilities associated with the Debtors' operations (the "Assumed
Liabilities") as set forth in the Stalking Horse SAPA, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth therein. Having announced the Stalking Horse Bid,
the Debtors will now conduct a round of open bidding intended to obtain the
highest and otherwise best bid for the Donlen Assets. The Stalking Horse Bid
is subject to higher and better offers submitted in accordance with the terms
of the Bidding Procedures.

claims, and defenses of the Debtors.

such assets, and such Bidder shall constitute a "Qualified Bidder" for such
assets; _provided_ that if the Debtors receive a Bid prior to the Bid

by the Stalking Horse Bidder) are received by the Bid Deadline, the Debtors

assumed liabilities; (ii) the number, type and nature of any changes to the
Stalking Horse SAPA requested by each Bidder; (iii) the extent to which such
modifications are likely to delay closing of the sale of the Donlen Assets and
the cost to the Debtors of such modifications or delay; (iv) the total
consideration to be received by the Debtors; (v) any contingencies or
conditions to closing the transaction; (vi) the likelihood of the Bidder's
ability to close a transaction and the timing thereof; (vii) the net benefit
to the Debtors' estates, taking into account the Stalking Horse Bidder's right

consequences of such Qualified Bid; and (ix) any other qualitative

Parties, deems reasonably appropriate under the circumstances (collectively,

purposes of this Auction, a Bidder must comply with the following conditions:

  



   | 1.|

 _Minimum  Overbid Increments_ : Any Overbid after and above the respective
Auction Baseline Bid  shall be made in increments valued at not less than
$5,000,000. Hertz reserves the right  to announce reductions or increases in
the minimum incremental bids (or in valuing such  bids) at any time during
the Auction. Additional consideration in excess of the amount  set forth in
the respective Auction Baseline Bid may include cash and/or noncash
consideration  including, without limitation, assumption of liabilities;
_provided_ , _however_ ,  that the value for such non-cash consideration
shall be determined by Hertz in its  reasonable business judgment. 

---|---|--- 
  

  



    | 2.|

 _Remaining  Terms Are the Same as for Qualified Bids_ : Except as modified
herein, an Overbid at  the Auction must comply with the conditions for a
Qualified Bid set forth above; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Bid
Deadline shall not apply. Any Overbid must include,  in addition to the
amount and the form of consideration of the Overbid, a description  of all
changes requested by the Bidder to the Stalking Horse SAPA, Modified SAPA or
Proposed  Sale Order, as the case may be, in connection therewith. Any
Overbid must remain open  and binding on the Bidder. At Hertz' discretion, to
the extent not previously provided,  a Bidder submitting an Overbid at the
Auction must submit, as part of its Overbid, written  evidence (in the form
of financial disclosure or credit-quality support information or  enhancement
reasonably acceptable to Hertz) reasonably demonstrating such Bidder's 
ability to satisfy the Bidder's Obligations as set forth in the Qualified Bid
requirements  set forth in Paragraph C.9(b) and (c). 

---|---|--- 
   



  

F. Announcement and Consideration of Overbids

  



   | 1.| _Announcement of Overbids_ :  Hertz shall announce at the
Auction the material terms of each Overbid, the total amount  of
consideration offered in each such Overbid, and the basis for calculating such
total  consideration. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 2.| _Consideration of Overbids_ :  Subject to the deadlines set
forth herein, Hertz reserves the right, in its reasonable  business judgment
and in consultation with the Consultation Parties, to make one or more 
continuances of the Auction to, among other things: facilitate discussions
between the  Debtors and individual Qualified Bidders; allow individual
Qualified Bidders to consider  how they wish to proceed; or give Qualified
Bidders the opportunity to provide the Debtors  with additional evidence as
Hertz in its reasonable business judgment may require, that  the Qualified
Bidder has sufficient internal resources, or has received sufficient non-
contingent  debt and/or equity funding commitments, to consummate the
proposed Competing Transaction  at the prevailing Overbid amount. 
---|---|--- 
  



    

 



    



  

G.   No Round-Skipping

  



  

To remain eligible to participate in the Auction, in each round of bidding,
(i) each Qualified Bidder must submit an Overbid with respect to such round
of bidding and (ii) to the extent a Qualified Bidder fails to submit an
Overbid with respect to such round of bidding, such Qualified Bidder shall be
disqualified from continuing to participate in the Auction with respect to the
Donlen Assets.

  



  

H.  Stalking Horse Termination Payments

  



  

To provide the Stalking Horse Bidder with an incentive to participate in a
competitive process and to compensate the Stalking Horse Bidder for (i)
performing substantial due diligence and incurring the expenses related
thereto and (ii) entering into the Stalking Horse SAPA with the knowledge and
risk that arises from participating in the sale and subsequent bidding
process, the Debtors have agreed to pay the Stalking Horse Bidder the Buyer
Expense Payment Amount in an amount not to exceed $15,000,000, the Termination
Fee in the amount of $24,750,000 (less the amount by which the Buyer Expense
Payment Amount paid or due to be paid contemporaneously with the Termination
Fee exceeds $7,500,000), the Option Fee in the amount of $15,000,000 (less the
amount by which any Buyer Expense Payment Amount paid or due to be paid
contemporaneously with the Option Fee, exceeds $10,000,000), and the Catch-Up
Fee (together with the Buyer Expense Payment Amount, the Termination Fee, and
the Option Fee, the "Termination Payments") in accordance with Section 7.14
of the Stalking Horse SAPA, in the event that the Stalking Horse SAPA is
terminated pursuant to certain provisions of the Stalking Horse SAPA. The
Debtors will take into account the Termination Payments in each round of
bidding.

  



  

The Termination Fee, Buyer Expense Payment Amount, the Option Fee, and the
Catch-Up Fee were material inducements for, and condition of, the
Stalking Horse Bidder's entry into the Stalking Horse SAPA. The Termination
Fee, Buyer Expense Payment Amount, Option Fee, Catch-Up Fee shall be payable
as set forth herein, in the Bid Procedures Order, and the Stalking Horse SAPA.
No Qualified Bidders other than the Stalking Horse Bidder shall be entitled
to payment of a termination fee, expense reimbursement, option fee, or other
break-up fee in connection with a Bid or the Auction.

  



  

I.  Backup Bidder

  



  

Notwithstanding anything in these Bidding Procedures to the contrary, if an
Auction is conducted, the Qualified Bidder (other than the Stalking Horse
Bidder) with the next highest or otherwise best Bid to the Successful Bid at
the Auction, as determined by Hertz, in the exercise of its business judgment
and after consulting with the Consultation Parties, will be designated as the
backup bidder (the "Back-Up Bidder"). The Back-Up Bidder shall be required to
keep its initial Qualified Bid (or if the Back-Up Bidder submitted one or
more Overbids at the Auction, the Backup Bidder's final Overbid) (the "Back-Up
Bid") open and irrevocable until the earlier of (i) 5:00 p.m. (prevailing
Eastern Time) on the date that is ninety (90) days after the date of entry of
the Sale Order, which date will be extended for an additional sixty (60) days
if the only condition to closing the Successful Bid that remains outstanding
on the ninetieth (90th) day after entry of the Sale Order is satisfaction of
regulatory approvals required under the applicable Modified SAPA (the
"Outside Back-Up Date"), or (ii) the closing of the transaction with the
Successful Bidder. For the avoidance of doubt, the Stalking Horse Bidder shall
only serve as the Back-Up Bidder to the extent and on the conditions set
forth in the Stalking Horse SAPA.

  



  

   

 



    



  

Following the Sale Hearing, if the Stalking Horse SAPA (as may be modified by
any Overbid submitted by the Stalking Horse Bidder) or a Modified SAPA
submitted by the Successful Bidder (as defined below) is terminated for any
reason prior to consummation of the transaction contemplated thereby (a
"Successful Bid Failure"), the Back-Up Bidder will be deemed to have the new
prevailing bid, and the Debtors will be authorized, without further order of
the Bankruptcy Court, to consummate the transaction with the Back-Up Bidder.
In the case of a Successful Bid Failure, the Successful Bidder's deposit shall
be forfeited to the Debtors or returned to the Bidder in accordance with the
terms of the terminated Stalking Horse SAPA or Modified SAPA. The Debtors, on
their behalf and on behalf of each of their respective estates, specifically
reserve the right to seek all available damages, including specific
performance, from any defaulting Successful Bidder (including any Back-Up
Bidder designated as a Successful Bidder) in accordance with the terms of the
Bidding Procedures, the Bidding Procedures Order, the Stalking Horse SAPA, or
the Modified SAPA, as applicable.

  



  

J.  Closing the Auction

  



  

The Auction shall continue until there is one Qualified Bid for the Donlen
Assets that Hertz determines in its reasonable business judgment, after
consultation with the Consultation Parties, is the highest or best Qualified
Bid at the Auction. Thereafter, Hertz shall select such Qualified Bid, in
consultation with the Consultation Parties, that is the best Qualified Bid
taking into account any factors Hertz reasonably deems relevant to the value
and certainty of the Qualified Bid to the Debtors' estates and may include,
but are not limited to, the Bid Assessment Criteria (such Bid, the "Successful
Bid," and the Bidder submitting such Successful Bid, the "Successful Bidder")
as the winner of the Auction.

  



  

The Auction shall close when the Successful Bidder submits fully executed
sale and transaction documents memorializing the terms of the Successful Bid.

  



  

Promptly following Hertz' selection of the Successful Bid and the conclusion
of the Auction, the Debtors shall announce the Successful Bid and Successful
Bidder and shall file with the Bankruptcy Court notice of the Successful Bid
and Successful Bidder.

  



  

The Debtors shall not consider any Overbids submitted after the conclusion of
the Auction.

  



  

K.  Approval of the Sale

  



  

A hearing to consider the approval of the Sale Transaction (the "Sale
Hearing"), is currently scheduled to take place on February 17, 2021 at 10:30
a.m. (prevailing Eastern Time), before the Honorable Mary F. Walrath, at the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, 824 Market
Street North, 3rd Floor, Wilmington, DE 19801 or conducted consistent with
the procedures established pursuant to the Bankruptcy Court's standing orders
regarding remote hearings in bankruptcy cases due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
all of which are facilitated via telephone or Zoom.

  



  

   

 



    



  

At the Sale Hearing certain findings will be sought from the Bankruptcy Court
regarding the Auction, including, among other things, that: (1) the Auction
was conducted (if held), and the Successful Bidder was selected, in accordance
with the Bidding Procedures; (2) the Auction (if held) was fair in substance
and procedure; (3) the Successful Bid was a Qualified Bid as defined in the
Bidding Procedures; and (4) consummation of any Sale as contemplated by the
Successful Bid in the Auction will provide the highest or otherwise best 
offer for the Donlen Assets and is in the best interests of the Debtors and
their estates. The Sale Hearing may be continued to a later date by the
Debtors by sending notice prior to, or making an announcement at, the Sale
Hearing. No further notice of any such continuance will be required to be
provided to any party (including the Stalking Horse Bidder).

  



  

Objections to the Sale Transaction, any of the relief requested in the
Motion, and entry of any order approving the sale (the "Sale Order") must (i)
be in writing and specify the nature of such objection; (ii) comply with the
Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules, Local Bankruptcy Rules, and all orders of
the Bankruptcy Court; and (iii) be filed with the Bankruptcy Court and served
so as to be actually received by the Debtors and counsel to the Debtors by
February 10, 2021 at 4:00 p.m. (prevailing Eastern Time).

  



  

L. Additional Procedures

  



  

Hertz, after consulting with the Consultation Parties, may announce at the
Auction additional procedural rules that are reasonable under the
circumstances for conducting the Auction so long as such rules are not
inconsistent in any material respect with the Bidding Procedures or the
Stalking Horse SAPA; _provided,_ that any Qualified Bidder, including the
Stalking Horse Bidder, shall have the right to request a telephonic hearing
before the Bankruptcy Court in the event the Qualified Bidder disputes that
the proposed additional rule is reasonable or not inconsistent in any
material respect with the Bidding Procedures or the Stalking Horse SAPA.

  



  

 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Authority as Condition to Bidding_

  



  

The Stalking Horse Bidder (solely in its capacity as a Bidder) and all
Qualified Bidders shall be deemed to have (1) consented to the
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court to enter an order or orders, which shall
be binding in all respects, in any way related to the Debtors, these Chapter
11 Cases, the Bidding Procedures, the Auction, the Stalking Horse SAPA, any
Competing Transaction, or the construction and enforcement of documents
relating to any Competing Transaction, (2) WAIVED ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTES RELATING TO THE DEBTORS, THESE CHAPTER 11 CASES,
THE BIDDING PROCEDURES, THE AUCTION, THE STALKING HORSE SAPA, ANY COMPETING
TRANSACTION, OR THE CONSTRUCTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ANY
COMPETING TRANSACTION, and (3) consented to entry of a final order or
judgment in any way related to the Debtors, these Chapter 11 Cases, the
Bidding Procedures, the Auction, the Stalking Horse SAPA any Competing
Transaction, or the construction and enforcement of documents relating to any
Competing Transaction if it is determined that the Bankruptcy Court would
lack Article III jurisdiction to enter such a final order or judgment absent
the consent of the parties.

  



  

   

 



    



  



  

 _Sale Is As Is/Where Is_

  



  

Except as set forth in the Stalking Horse SAPA, the Donlen Assets or any
other assets of the Donlen Debtors sold pursuant to the Bidding
Procedures shall be conveyed at Closing in their then-present condition, "AS
IS, WITH ALL FAULTS, AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED."

  



  

 _Return of Good Faith Deposits_

  



  

The Good Faith Deposits of all Qualified Bidders, including the Stalking
Horse Bidder, shall be held in one or more interest-bearing escrow accounts
by the Debtors, but shall not become property of the Debtors' estates absent
further order of the Bankruptcy Court. The Good Faith Deposit of any
Qualified Bidder, including the Stalking Horse Bidder, that is neither the
Successful Bidder nor the Back-Up Bidder shall be returned to such Qualified
Bidder not later than five (5) Business Days after the Sale Hearing. The Good
Faith Deposit of the Back-Up Bidder, if any, shall be returned to the Back-Up
Bidder (or retained by the estates) upon the termination of such Back-Up
Bidder's Modified SAPA or Stalking Horse SAPA, as the case may be, in
accordance with its terms. Upon any return of the Good Faith Deposits, their
respective owners shall receive any and all interest that will have accrued
thereon If the Successful Bidder timely closes the transaction contemplated
in the Successful Bid, its Good Faith Deposit shall be credited towards
the purchase price.

  



  

 _Reservation of Rights of the Debtors and Modifications_

  



  

Except as otherwise provided in these Bidding Procedures or the Bidding
Procedures Order, Hertz further reserves the right as it may reasonably
determine in its sole discretion to be in the best interest of the Debtors'
estates to: (i) determine which bidders are Qualified Bidders; (ii) determine
which Bids are Qualified Bids; (iii) determine which Qualified Bid is the
highest or best proposal and which is the next highest or best proposal; (iv)
reject any Bid that is (a) inadequate or insufficient, (b) not in conformity
with the requirements of the Bidding Procedures or the requirements of the
Bankruptcy Code or (c) contrary to the best interests of the Debtors and
their estates; (v) waive terms and conditions set forth herein with respect to
all potential bidders; (vi) impose additional terms and conditions with
respect to all potential bidders; (vii) extend the deadlines set forth herein;
(viii) continue or cancel the Auction and/or Sale Hearing in open court
without further notice; and (ix) modify the Bidding Procedures and implement
additional procedural rules that Hertz determines, in its business judgment,
will better promote the goals of the bidding process and discharge its
fiduciary duties and are not inconsistent with any Bankruptcy Court order. Any
such modification, amendment or waivers of the Bidding Procedures shall not
affect the rights of the Stalking Horse Bidder under the Stalking Horse SAPA,
including with respect to the Termination Payments.

 _Assets to Be Sold_

  



  

To facilitate the Sale of the Donlen Assets and after engaging in a marketing
process, Donlen Corp. and certain of its subsidiaries, as sellers, selected
the bid (the "Stalking Horse Bid") of Freedom Acquirer LLC (the "Stalking
Horse Bidder") as the initial stalking horse bid for the Donlen Assets. The
Stalking Horse Bidder has executed that certain Stock and Asset Purchase
Agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified by the parties
thereto, and including the disclosure schedules and exhibits attached
thereto, the "Stalking Horse SAPA"), dated November 25, 2020 entered into by
and among certain of the Debtors and the Stalking Horse Bidder pursuant to
which the Stalking Horse Bidder has agreed to effectuate the Sale, which
includes the purchase of the Purchased Assets (as defined in the Stalking
Horse SAPA)3 and the assumption of certain liabilities associated with the
Debtors' operations as set forth in the Stalking Horse SAPA, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein. A copy of the Stalking Horse SAPA is

is subject to higher and better offers submitted in accordance with the terms
of the Bidding Procedures.

otherwise provided in the Stalking Horse SAPA or a Modified SAPA submitted by

Debtors' right, title and interest in and to the Donlen Assets subject
thereto shall be sold free and clear of any pledges, liens, security
interests, encumbrances, claims, charges, options and interests thereon
(collectively, as more fully defined in the proposed Sale Order, the
"Interests"), subject only to the Assumed Liabilities and Permitted
Encumbrances (each as defined in the Stalking Horse SAPA or in the
Modified SAPA of the Successful Bidder, as applicable), to the maximum extent
permitted by section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, with such Interests to
attach to the net proceeds of the sale of the Donlen Assets with the same
validity, force, effect, and priority as such Interests applied against the
Donlen Assets, subject to any rights, claims, and defenses of the Debtors.

identification number are 8568. The location of the debtors' service address
is 8501 Williams Road, Estero, FL 33928. Due to the large number of debtors in
these Chapter 11 Cases, which are jointly administered for procedural
purposes, a complete list of the debtors and the last four digits of their
federal tax identification numbers is not provided herein. A complete list of
such information may be obtained on the website of the debtors' claims and
noticing agent at _https://restructuring.primeclerk.com/hertz_.

  

2 Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Bidding
Procedures Order.

  



  

   

 



    



  

To facilitate a Sale of the Donlen Assets and after engaging in a marketing
process, Donlen Corp. and certain of its subsidiaries, as sellers, selected
the bid of Freedom Acquirer LLC (the "Stalking Horse Bidder") as the initial
stalking horse bid for the Donlen Assets. The Stalking Horse Bidder has
executed that certain Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (as
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified by the parties thereto, and
including the disclosure schedules and exhibits attached thereto, the
"Stalking Horse SAPA"), dated November 25, 2020 entered into by and among
certain of the Debtors and the Stalking Horse Bidder pursuant to which the
Stalking Horse Bidder has agreed to effectuate the Sale Transaction,
which includes the purchase of the Purchased Assets (as defined in the
Stalking Horse SAPA)3 and the assumption of certain liabilities associated
with the Debtors' operations as set forth in the Stalking Horse SAPA, subject
to the terms and conditions set forth therein. A copy of the Stalking Horse
SAPA is attached as Exhibit B to the Motion.

  



  

YOU ARE RECEIVING THIS NOTICE BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A
COUNTERPARTY TO A CONTRACT OR LEASE THAT MAY BE ASSUMED AND ASSIGNED AS
PART OF THE SALE.

  



  

 _Assigned Contracts and Cure Amounts_

  



  

Pursuant to the Assumption and Assignment Procedures established by the
Bidding Procedures Order, set forth on Exhibit A hereto are (a) the executory
contracts and unexpired leases that the Debtors believe they might seek to
assume and assign to the Stalking Horse Bidder or any other Successful Bidder
in connection with a Sale (collectively, the "Assigned Contracts"), and (b)
the amounts that the Debtors believe are owed to each counterparty to each
Assigned Contract to cure any defaults or arrears existing under the Assigned
Contracts (the "Cure Amounts"). Other than the Cure Amounts listed, the
Debtors are not aware of any amounts due and owing under the Assigned
Contracts. The inclusion of an Assigned Contract on Exhibit A shall not
constitute an admission that such Assigned Contract is an executory contract
or lease.

  



  

The Stalking Horse Bidder has demonstrated its ability to comply with the
requirements of adequate assurance of future performance under
section 365(f)(2)(B) and, if applicable, section 365(b)(3) of the Bankruptcy
Code. Information regarding the Stalking Horse Bidder's (or its designated
affiliate's) ability to comply with the requirements of adequate assurance of
future performance under section 365(f)(2)(B) and, if applicable, section
365(b)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code, including, without limitation, the
assignee's financial wherewithal and willingness to perform under the
Assigned Contracts (the "Adequate Assurance Information"), is available upon
request by contacting counsel to the Debtors. If a Successful Bidder that is
not the Stalking Horse Bidder prevails at the Auction, Adequate Assurance
Information regarding the Successful Bidder will be available upon request by
contacting counsel to the Successful Bidder.

  



  

  



  

  

3 As used herein, the  "Purchased Assets" consist of the Donlen Assets the
Debtors have agreed to sell, and the Stalking Horse Bidder has agreed to
purchase, on the terms set forth in the Stalking Horse SAPA. The Purchased
Assets constitute substantially all of the Donlen Assets other than the
"Excluded Assets" as set forth in the Stalking Horse SAPA.

 _Objection Deadlines and Sale Hearing_

  



  

 _Assumption and Cure Objection Deadline_. Objections to the (a) proposed
assumption and assignment of an Assigned Contract to the Stalking Horse
Bidder, including the adequate assurance of future performance by the Stalking
Horse Bidder (an "Assumption Objection"), and (b) to the proposed Cure
Amounts (a "Cure Objection") must, in each case, (i) be in writing and
specify the nature of such objection, (ii) state with specificity what cure
amount the party to the Assigned Contract believes is required if different
than the applicable Cure Amount (in all cases with appropriate documentation
in support thereof), and (iii) be filed with the Court and served on: (1)
counsel to the Debtors, White and Case LLP, 200 South Biscayne Boulevard,
Suite 4900, Miami, FL 33131 Attn: Thomas E Lauria (tlauria@whitecase.com),
Matthew Brown (mbrown@whitecase.com), and White and Case LLP, 555 S. Flower
St., Suite 2700, Los Angeles, CA 90071, Attn: Aaron Colodny
(aaron.colodny@whitecase.com) and (2) counsel to the Stalking Horse Bidder,
Sidley Austin LLP, One South Dearborn, Chicago, Illinois 60603, Attn: Dennis

(the "Notice Parties"), so as to be received on or before [*], 2020 at 4:00
p.m. (prevailing Eastern Time) (the "Cure Objection Deadline").

  



  

The Debtors and any counterparty that files an objection to the applicable
Cure Amount shall first confer in good faith to attempt to resolve the
applicable Cure Objection without Court intervention. If a timely Cure
Objection cannot otherwise be resolved by the parties, the Cure Objection may
be heard at the Sale Hearing or, at the option of the Debtors, in consultation
with the Successful Bidder, be adjourned to a subsequent hearing (each such
Cure Objection, an "Adjourned Cure Objection"). An Adjourned Cure Objection
may be resolved after the closing date of the Sale Transaction; _provided_ ,
that, with respect to any disputed cure amounts asserted in a timely filed
Cure Objection, the Debtors shall, within ten (10) Business Days after
the entry of the Sale Order, establish or cause to be established a cash
reserve in an amount sufficient to pay the disputed cure amounts in full.

  



  

 _Alternative Assumption Objection Deadline_. If a Successful Bidder that is
not the Stalking Horse Bidder prevails at the Auction, the deadline to file
an Assumption Objection with respect to such Successful Bidder shall be
extended to the date that is one (1) Business Day before the Sale Hearing.
Such Assumption Objections must be (i) in writing and specify the nature of
such objection and (ii) filed with the Court and served on the Notice Parties
one (1) Business Day before the Sale Hearing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
all Cure Objections must be filed by the Cure Objection Deadline regardless of
whether the Stalking Horse Bidder is the Successful Bidder.

  



  

Any Assumption Objection filed with the Court that includes confidential,
non-public Adequate Assurance Information must and is authorized to be filed
under seal unless disclosure of such confidential, non-public information is
authorized by the Debtors and the applicable assignee or assignees. The party
filing such an objection under seal shall follow the procedures set forth in
Local Rule 9018-1(d). Unredacted versions of such objections shall be served
upon the Debtors, the Committee, the U.S. Trustee and the applicable
assignee or assignees, with a copy to the Court's chambers.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

 _Sale Hearing_. All Assumption Objections and Cure Objections (other than
Adjourned Cure Objections) will be heard at the Sale Hearing, which is
currently scheduled to take place on February 17, 2021 at 10:30 a.m.
(prevailing Eastern Time) before the Honorable Mary F. Walrath, at the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, 824 Market Street North,
5th Floor, Wilmington, DE 19801 or conducted consistent with the procedures
established pursuant to the Bankruptcy Court's standing orders
regarding remote hearings in bankruptcy cases due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
all of which are facilitated via telephone and/or Zoom. The Sale Hearing may
be continued to a later date by the Debtors by filing notice prior to, or
making an announcement at, the Sale Hearing. No further notice of any such
continuance will be required to be provided to any party (including the
Stalking Horse Bidder).

Bidder on a confidential basis by submitting a written request to counsel for
the Debtors (an "Adequate Assurance Information Request"). If a Successful
Bidder that is not the Stalking Horse Bidder prevails at the Auction, you may

 _Consequences of Failing to Object_

PROPERTY LEASE, THAT DOES NOT TIMELY FILE AND SERVE A CURE OBJECTION OR
ASSUMPTION OBJECTION BY THE APPLICABLE OBJECTION DEADLINES STATED IN THIS
NOTICE SHALL BE (I) DEEMED TO HAVE CONSENTED TO, AND SHALL BE FOREVER
BARRED FROM OBJECTING TO, (A) THE CURE AMOUNT AND (B) THE ASSUMPTION AND
ASSIGNMENT OF THE ASSIGNED CONTRACT, AND (II) FOREVER BARRED AND ESTOPPED

in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any
provision of this Bill of Sale is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable

incapability of enforcement and to effect the original intent of the parties
hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the

federal court within the State of Delaware and any direct appellate court
therefrom). Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to

suit or Proceeding, (i) any Claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the
failure to serve process in accordance with Section 10.3 of the Purchase
Agreement, (ii) any Claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
Claim that (x) the suit, action or Proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such suit, action or Proceeding is
improper or (z) this Bill of Sale or the subject matter hereof may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Each party hereto agrees that notice or the
service of process in any action, Claim, suit or Proceeding arising out of,

obligations arising hereunder shall be properly served or delivered if

Agreement.

  



  

(c)  Each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any and all right such party may
have to trial by jury in any action, Claim, suit or Proceeding (whether based
in contract, tort or otherwise) between the parties hereto arising out of,
based upon or relating to this Bill of Sale or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof.

This Bill of Sale and any amendments hereto may be executed in one (1) or
more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original of
this Bill of Sale or such amendment and all of which, when taken together,
will constitute one and the same instrument, and to the extent signed and

any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of a facsimile machine or electronic mail as a defense to the
formation or enforceability of a contract and each such party forever waives

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

  



  

This Transition Services Agreement (together with the Schedules attached
hereto, this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of [*], 2020, by and
between [The Hertz Corporation], a Delaware corporation ("Hertz"or
"Provider"), and Freedom Acquirer LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Buyer" or "Recipient"). Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Agreement (as
defined below).

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, Donlen Corporation, an Illinois corporation, and certain of its
direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates commenced voluntary
cases under the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court on May 22, 2020 and
are being jointly administered for procedural purposes as  _In re The Hertz
Corporation,_ et al., Bankr. D. Del. Case No. 20-11218 (MFW) (collectively,
the "Bankruptcy Cases");

  



  

WHEREAS, in connection with the Bankruptcy Cases, the parties hereto entered
into that certain Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of November
25, 2020 (the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which the Selling Entities
agreed to sell and transfer to the Buyer, and the Buyer agreed to purchase
and acquire from the Selling Entities, pursuant to Sections 105, 363 and 365
of the Bankruptcy Code, the Purchased Assets, and the Buyer agreed to assume
from the Selling Entities the Assumed Liabilities, all as more specifically
provided in the Purchase Agreement and in the Sale Order; and

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Hertz and Buyer have agreed to
enter into this Agreement in order to provide for the provision of
certain transitional services in connection with the divestiture and sale of
the Business from Donlen to Buyer, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereinafter set forth.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants
and agreements contained herein and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as
follows:

  



  

1. _Services to be Provided_.

  



  

(a) During the Transition Period (as defined below) (or such shorter
periods as may be specified in _Schedule A_ or until otherwise terminated in
accordance with this Agreement), Hertz shall provide (or cause to be provided
by an Affiliate or a Non-Affiliated Service Provider in accordance with
_Section 1(d)_ ) to Buyer and its Subsidiaries which own or operate the
Business the services described on _Schedule A_ (collectively, the
"Services") in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, including _Section 3_. The Services shall only be
made available for, and Buyer shall only be entitled to utilize the Services
for, the benefit of the operation of the Business. Recipient shall not allow
access to or use of the Services by any Person other than Recipient and its
Subsidiaries which own or operate the Business and its and their respective
employees, independent contractors, and other service providers, without the
prior written consent of Provider, which consent may be granted or withheld
in Provider's sole discretion.

  



  

   

 



    



  

(b)  The parties shall cooperate with each other in connection with the
performance of the Services.

  



  

(c)  The parties shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any consents, permits or licenses from any third party (including software
licenses from Non-Affiliated Service Providers) that may be required in
connection with the provision of the Services hereunder. Recipient shall pay
three quarters (3/4) and Provider shall pay one quarter (1/4) of any fees or
charges imposed by a third-party supplier for the provision of such consent;
provided, that prior to agreeing to any such fee or charge, (i) the parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to limit or otherwise minimize such
fees or charges, (ii) the parties shall reasonably cooperate in any further
effort to limit or otherwise minimize such fees or charges and (iii) such
third party shall agree that such fees or charges imposed by it shall only
apply to the Services provided to Recipient. Provider shall not be
required to waive any right or assume any material obligation, or initiate
any Claim, Proceeding or litigation against, any such third party to obtain
any such consents, permits or licenses. If the parties cannot obtain a consent
under _Section 1(c)_ , then the parties shall work together to develop and
implement an alternative means of continuing the provision of the applicable
Service to the reasonable satisfaction of Recipient and Provider.

  



  

(d) Provider may provide any or all of the Services through Affiliates
or through non-Affiliated third party service providers or
subcontractors (collectively, "Non-Affiliated Service Providers") (i) to the
extent such Non-Affiliated Service Providers were engaged in providing the
same services to Recipient prior to Closing or (ii) with Recipient's prior
written consent;  _provided_ that, subject to _Section 1(c)_ and the
penultimate sentence of this _Section 1(d)_ , the use of Non-
Affiliated Service Providers shall not relieve Provider of any of its
obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the use of
Non-Affiliated Service Providers shall be subject to service standards set
forth in the Contracts entered into with such Non-Affiliated Service
Providers. If a third party Contract pursuant to which a Service is provided
by a Non-Affiliated Service Provider expires or terminates during the term of
this Agreement, Provider shall use commercially reasonable effort to
renew, extend or replace such third party Contract; _provided_ that, if such
renewal, extension or replacement results in a material increase to the costs
or other obligations of such third party Contract (as reasonably determined by
Provider), then (i) Recipient may agree to pay the increased costs or assume
such obligations and Provider shall renew, extend or replace such Contract or
(ii) if Recipient does not agree to pay the increased costs or assume such
increased obligations, Provider may allow such Contract to expire or
terminate and Provider may cease to provide the Services being provided by
such Non-Affiliated Service Provider under such third party Contract to
Recipient effective as of the date on which Provider's Contract with such Non-
Affiliated Service Provider expires or terminates (and it shall not be
considered a breach of this Agreement for failure to provide any such
Service following such expiry or termination). Provider shall not be liable
to Recipient for, or be in breach of this Agreement due to, any non-
performance of the Services that is due to the failure to obtain any required
licenses, assignments, rights or consents from Non-Affiliated Services
Providers. Recipient hereby agrees to be bound by and to observe and comply
with all of the terms of any such third party Contracts or licenses which
Recipient may use during the term of this Agreement.

  



  

   

-2-

 



    



  

(e)   Except as otherwise set forth on _Schedule A_ , management
of, and control over, the provision of the Services provided hereunder
(including the determination or designation at any time of the equipment,
employees and other resources of Provider, its Affiliates or any Non-
Affiliated Service Provider engaged in accordance with _Section 1(d)_ to be
used in connection with the provision of such Services) shall reside solely
with Provider. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as
provided in any Schedule hereto, all labor matters relating to any employees
of Provider, its Affiliates and any Non-Affiliated Service Provider shall be
within the exclusive control of such entity, and Recipient shall not have any
rights with respect to, such matters. Except as provided in _Schedule A_
hereto, Provider shall be solely responsible for the payment of all
salary and benefits and all Taxes (including income tax, social security
taxes, unemployment compensation, workers' compensation tax, other employment
taxes or withholdings) and premiums and remittances with respect to employees
used to provide any Services hereunder.

  



  

(f)  Except to the extent such materials are provided by
Recipient in the course of receiving the Services, all procedures, methods,
systems, strategies, tools, equipment, facilities, products and other
materials or resources used by Provider, its Affiliates, or any Non-
Affiliated Service Provider in connection with the provision of Services
hereunder shall remain the property of Provider, its Affiliates or such Non-
Affiliated Service Provider and shall at all times be under the sole direction
and control of Provider, its Affiliates or such Non-Affiliated Service
Provider. All rights of Provider, its Affiliates and any Non-Affiliated
Service Provider not expressly granted herein are expressly reserved.

  



  

(g) In the event that Recipient discovers prior to the date
that is ninety (90) days after the date hereof that a service that
was provided by Provider to the Business during the twelve (12)-month period
prior to the date hereof is not being provided by Provider to Recipient
pursuant hereto, Recipient may, at its option, notify Provider of Recipient's
request that Provider provide or cause to be provided such additional service
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that such additional service shall not
include (i) any services prohibited by Law, contract or applicable policies of
Hertz in effect as of the date of the Purchase Agreement, or (ii) except as
otherwise provided in _Schedule A_ attached hereto or in _Section 4(b)_ , any
internal audit, audit/review assistance for time periods prior to the Closing,
advice, determinations or opinions with regard to GAAP, hedging transactions
and derivatives, insurance risk management, financial functions,
treasury, tax, legal, trade compliance or accounting advice or assistance for
time periods prior to the Closing. As promptly as practicable following
receipt of any such notice, Provider, at its sole option, may either provide
such additional service to Recipient consistent with the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein or cooperate with the Recipient to identify
and retain a third party vendor to provide such additional service at the
expense of the Recipient not to exceed Provider's actual cost in providing
such service without markup; _provided_ that Provider shall not be
obligated to provide such service until Hertz and Buyer agree on the terms
therefor.

  



  

2. _Consideration for Services_.

  



  

(a) The Recipient shall pay to Provider the fee for the Services
(or category of Services, as applicable) as provided in the relevant Schedule
(each such fee constituting a "Service Charge") as set forth on _Schedule A_.
Reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Provider specified in _Schedule A_
, excluding the cost of any Non-Affiliated Service Provider that is
providing goods or services used by Provider in providing the Services (e.g.,
license costs for software) and any Taxes, such as VAT (but excluding income
taxes), imposed under Law on the provision of services (but not on any income
of Provider received in connection with provision of such services) will be
an incremental cost to Recipient in addition to the Service Charges, and will
be charged to Recipient at the actual cost and/or amount of Taxes so imposed.
Provider shall obtain Recipient's written consent prior to incurring any out-
of-pocket cost of $[*] or more in one (1) calendar month.

  



  

   

-3-

 



    



  

(b)  Provider shall deliver invoices to Recipient on a monthly
basis for Services provided to Recipient during the preceding month. Provider
agrees to provide Recipient such records and documentation of Provider as
Recipient may reasonably request in connection with any invoice in order to
verify the details of such invoices and charges for Services hereunder or
additional out-of-pocket costs as set forth in _Section 2(a)_.

  



  

(c)  Recipient shall pay the amount of such invoice by wire
transfer to Provider within thirty (30) days of the date of issuance of such
invoice to the account specified by Provider excluding any portion of the
invoice that Recipient disputes in good faith;  _provided_ that with respect
to Services rendered outside the United States, payments may be required to be
made in local currency if indicated in _Schedule A_. If Recipient fails to
pay such amount within five (5) Business Days of receiving notice from
Provider that a payment is past due, Recipient shall be obligated to pay to
Provider, in addition to the amount due, interest on such past due amounts at
the rate equal to the lesser of (A) the U.S. prime rate (as published by _The
Wall Street Journal) _ plus 5.0% and (B) the maximum rate of interest
permitted by applicable Law, accruing from the date the payment was due
through the date of actual payment.

  



  

(d)  If Recipient disputes in good faith any portion of the
amount due on any invoice, then Recipient shall notify Provider in writing of
the nature and basis of the dispute in reasonable detail within 45 days after
Recipients receipt of such invoices. In the event notification is so provided
to Provider, the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve the dispute in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set
forth in _Section 13(b)_. Upon resolution of an invoice dispute in favor of
Provider, Recipient, within five (5) Business Days of the resolution of such
dispute, shall be obligated to pay to Provider the remaining amount due.

  



  

(e) Recipient shall pay the full amount of the Service Charges
and shall not set-off, counterclaim or otherwise withhold any amount owed
to Provider under this Agreement on account of any obligation owed by
Provider to Recipient unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing.

  



  

3. _Standard for Service_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or _Schedule
A_ hereto, and subject to _Sections 1(b)_ and (c), Provider shall perform
each Service (i) in compliance in all material respects with (A) all
applicable security, confidentiality, integrity, availability, and safety
policies and procedures of Provider and (B) all applicable Laws and (ii) such
that the nature, quality, standard of care, level of priority and the service
level at which such Service is performed is not materially less than the
nature, quality, standard of care, level of priority and service level at
which substantially the same service was performed by or on behalf of
Provider to the Business in the twelve (12) months prior to Closing. Recipient
will provide all information which is reasonably requested with respect to
the performance of Services on a timely basis as reasonably requested by
Provider, and Provider will not be responsible to the extent Recipient's
failure to do so within a reasonable time following the request results in a
failure to perform the Service in accordance with this _Section 3(a)_.

  



  

   

-4-

 



    



  

(b)  Provider shall provide notice to Recipient (i) at least two
(2) Business Days prior to any scheduled unavailability (other than a Force
Majeure Event) of a Service (such unavailability, a "Service Interruption")
(including information regarding the nature and projected length of the
Service Interruption), other than any Service Interruption that results from
the actions of a Non-Affiliated Service Provider without providing reasonable
prior notice to Provider, and (ii) upon becoming aware of the occurrence of
any emergency or unscheduled Service Interruption, including, to the extent
known by Provider, information regarding the nature and projected length of
the Service Interruption. In the event of any failure, interruption, delay or
outage, Provider agrees to use the same degree of care to restore, or cause
the restoration of, the Services as Provider would use to restore, or cause
the restoration of, similar services for itself, but in any event no less than
commercially reasonable efforts.

  



  

(c)  The parties acknowledge the transitional nature of the
Services and that Provider or its Affiliates may make changes from time to
time in the manner of performing the Services if Provider or its Affiliates
(i) are making similar changes in performing similar services for their own
Affiliates or businesses; (ii) furnish to Recipient substantially the same
notice (in content and timing) as Provider or its Affiliates furnish to their
own Affiliates respecting such changes; and (iii) such changes do not have a
material negative impact on the Business.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Provider's shall not
be liable for any delay or failure in providing the Services solely to the
extent such delay or failure results from Recipient's failure to provide
information, materials and like items to Provider as required under this
Agreement, except where such failure does not materially impact Providers
ability to provide such Services.

  



  

4. _Cooperation for Statutory and Tax Filings_. Each party undertakes and agrees to cooperate with the other party in accordance with the standard for Services described in _Section 3_ to enable such party to complete in a timely manner any and all statutory and Tax filings required to be filed by such party and/or its Affiliates pursuant to the Purchase Agreement that include any information related to the Business. Each party will provide and, as applicable, cause its employees, representatives and its Affiliates and their employees and representatives to provide, all such reasonable cooperation to the other party, its Affiliates and their respective representatives with respect to such filings as is reasonably requested and furnishing or causing to be furnished records, information, work papers, reports and other documents as requested by such party, its Affiliates or their respective representatives and causing Transferred Employees who possess relevant knowledge to make themselves available for consultation with respect to the foregoing.

  



  

   

-5-

 



    



  

5.   _Force Majeure_. Other than each Party's performance under _Section 2_ of this Agreement, neither Party shall be responsible for a delay in its performance under this Agreement if prohibited by Law or caused by any of the following to the extent beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party: (i) acts of God, (ii) man-made or natural disasters, including weather, storm, fire, flood, earthquake, tornado, tsunami, effects of climate change, hurricane or explosion, (iii) war (whether or not declared), invasion, sabotage, terrorism, cyberterrorism, police action, local, regional, national or international political or social conditions or any national or international hostilities, riot or other civil unrest, or any escalation or worsening of any such conditions, hostilities or acts, (iv) changes in Laws, (v) actions, embargoes or blockades in effect on after the date of this Agreement, (vi) action by any Governmental Authority, (vii) national or regional emergency or accident, (viii) strike or labor stoppages or other industrial disturbances, (ix) shortage of adequate transportation facilities, or necessary equipment, materials or labor, (x) pandemics, disease, outbreak and public health crises, in each case, including and any direct or indirect consequence or condition thereof, including outbreaks or additional waves of outbreaks of any contagious diseases (including influenza, COVID-19 or any variation thereof) or (xi) power or other utility failures, disruptions or other failures in internet and/or other telecommunication lines (a "Force Majeure Event"); Provider shall notify Recipient as soon as reasonably practicable, in writing, upon learning of the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event. Provider shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effect of any Force Majeure Event and to continue the provision of Services to the full extent possible during the Force Majeure event. Subject to compliance with the first sentence of this _Section 5_ , Provider's obligations hereunder in respect of the Services affected by the Force Majeure Event shall be postponed for such time as its performance is suspended or delayed on account of the Force Majeure Event, and upon the cessation of the Force Majeure Event, Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to resume its performance hereunder.

  



  

6.   _Confidential and Proprietary Information and Rights_.

  



  

(a) Each party hereto shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and
each of their respective Representatives to, hold confidential all
information and documents relating to the business of the other party or its
Affiliates disclosed to it in connection with this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the terms of this Agreement) (the "Confidential
Information"), and will not disclose any such Confidential Information to any
Person or entity without the prior written consent of the disclosing party
unless legally required or compelled to disclose such Confidential Information
(including upon the demand of any applicable regulatory agency, national
securities exchange or Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over such
Party); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that either party hereto may share
Confidential Information with (x) any of its Affiliates, and any of either of
their respective rating agencies, directors, managers, officers, employees,
attorneys and accountants and (y) any other Representatives and Non-
Affiliated Service Providers, in each case who have a "need to know" such
Confidential Information for the performance of, or in connection with, the
Services (it being understood that (i) each such Person shall be informed by
such party of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and
shall be directed by such party to treat the Confidential
Information confidentially and not to use it other than for the purposes
described above; and (ii) in any event, such party shall be responsible for
any disclosure or use of Confidential Information by any such Person that is
not permitted by this Agreement (it being understood that such responsibility
will be in addition to, and not by way of limitation of, any right or remedy
such party may have against such Person with respect to any such disclosure
or use); _provided_ , _further_ , that each party shall remain liable for any
breach of this _Section 6_ by any of its respective Affiliates,
Representatives or Non-Affiliated Service Providers, as applicable. This
obligation of confidentiality shall not (i) apply to information that is or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by the receiving party or any of its Affiliates or its
Representatives in breach of this _Section 6_ or (ii) prohibit any disclosure
(A) required by Law (including disclosure required in respect of
the receiving party's or its Affiliates' Tax returns) or required or
requested by any Governmental Authority, in each case so long as, to the
extent legally permissible and feasible, the receiving party provides the
disclosing party with reasonable prior notice of such disclosure so that the
disclosing party may seek to obtain a protective order or other reasonable
assurance that such disclosure shall be treated confidentially (at the
disclosing party's sole cost and expense) or (B) made in connection with any
litigation regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

   

-6-

 



    



  

(b) The foregoing obligation of confidentiality shall be in effect
during the Transition Services Period and any extensions thereof and for a
period of three (3) years after the termination or expiration of this
Agreement.

  



  

7. _Term, Termination, and Transition_.

  



  

(a)  The term of this Agreement (the "Transition Period") shall
commence on the Closing Date and continue with respect to each of the
Services for the term thereof, which term shall, unless otherwise set forth in
the Schedules (including any extension period on _Schedule A_ ), terminate on
the earlier of (x) the date which is twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date and (y) the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7(b)_ ; _provided_ that except as otherwise specified on any Schedule hereto
(i) Recipient may terminate one or more of the Services it receives at any
time and for any reason on not less than thirty (30) days prior written
notice to Provider and (ii) both parties may terminate this Agreement with
respect to one or more Services immediately upon mutual agreement; _provided_
, _further_ , that in accordance with  _Section 1(d)_ , some Services
provided by Non-Affiliated Third Parties may terminate earlier.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party reserves the
right to immediately terminate this Agreement by written notice to the other
in the event that:

  



  

(i) all Services as set forth in _Schedule A_ have expired in
accordance with such Schedules, or have been completed or
otherwise terminated; or

  



  

(ii) the other party breaches or is in default of any material
obligation under this Agreement (which includes any default in the payment of
consideration for the Services when due except for amounts that are disputed
by the Recipient in good faith) and such breach or default remains uncured
for thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from the non-breaching
party.

  



  

(c)  Upon the effective date of termination of any Service
pursuant to this Agreement, the Provider will have no further obligation to
provide the terminated Service, and the relevant Recipient will have no
obligation to pay for such Service Charges relating to any such Service;
_provided_ that Recipient shall remain obligated to the relevant Provider for
the Service Charges and any other fees, costs and expenses owed and payable
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement in respect of Services
provided prior to the effective date of termination. Upon the effective date
of termination of any Service pursuant to this Agreement, the relevant
Provider shall reduce for the next monthly billing period the amount of the
Service Charge for the category of Services in which the terminated Service
was included (such reduction to reflect the elimination of all costs incurred
in connection with the terminated Service to the extent the same are not
required to provide other Services to Recipient). In connection with
termination of any Service, the provisions of this Agreement not relating
solely to such terminated Service shall survive any such termination.

subsequent breaches of the same or other terms or conditions.

Provider and Recipient shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that they and their respective Non-Affiliated Service Provider, employees, officers, directors, Affiliates and agents do not, make any use of or attempt to gain access to any part of the other party's business systems and communications networks or to any data of the other party or its Affiliates not specifically made available to that party under this Agreement.

harmless the Provider Covered Persons from and against all Losses arising

of-pocket expenses as incurred in investigating, preparing, pursuing, or
defending any Action arising out of Recipient's willful misconduct or
negligence.

  



  

(b)  Except in the case of willful misconduct or gross

13.   _General Provisions_.

  



  

(a)   _Notice_. All notices, consents, waivers and other
communications required or permitted under, or otherwise made in connection
with, this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly
given or made (i) when delivered in person, (ii) upon confirmation of receipt
when transmitted by email, (iii) upon receipt after dispatch by registered or
certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested), or (iv) on the
next Business Day if transmitted by national overnight courier (with written
confirmation of delivery), in each case, addressed at the address specified
for notices in accordance with Section 10.3 of the Purchase Agreement (or to
such other addresses as a Party may designate by notice to the other party).

  



  

(b)   _Governance and Dispute Resolution_.

  



  

(i) Hertz and Buyer will each designate a qualified employee to serve
as its principal representative to coordinate and facilitate the provision of
Services (each, a "Representative"). Subject to _Section 13(a)_ and _Section
13(m)_ , the Representatives will be granted sufficient authority on behalf
of Hertz and Buyer, respectively, to answer questions and coordinate the
provision of Services and to act as a day-to-day contact with the other
party's Representative. The Representatives shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to meet by telephone every week during the Transition Period to the
extent deemed necessary by the Representatives. Either Party may change its
Representative by providing written notice to the other Party. From the date
hereof until further written notice to the other party, the representative of
Hertz shall be [*], and the representative of Buyer shall be [*]. Unless
otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, including in this _Section 13_ ,
all communications relating to this Agreement and the Services will be made
in accordance with _Section 13(a)_.

  



  

(ii) Any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be considered by a
meeting, in person or otherwise, by the Representatives within five (5)
Business Days after receipt of a written notice from either party specifying a
dispute and the nature thereof. In the event that the Representatives are
unable to resolve a dispute within five (5) Business Days of such initial
meeting or other initial discussion, each Representative shall escalate the
dispute to a designee of each party's chief executive officer (the
"Designees"). The Designees shall consider such dispute in person,
teleconference or by telephone within five (5) Business Days after receipt of
the escalation of such dispute from the Representatives and shall meet as
often as reasonably necessary and confer in good faith to resolve the
dispute. If the Designees are unable to resolve the dispute within fifteen
(15) days after their initial meeting, either party may initiate and the
parties shall seek to resolve such dispute by mediation for an additional
thirty (30) days. If the dispute is not resolved within such thirty (30) day
period, either party may bring an action in accordance with the Purchase
Agreement to resolve the dispute.

  



  

   

-11-

 



    



  

(c)   _No Partnership, Joint Venture Or Agency Created_. The
relationship of Provider and Recipient shall be that of
independent contractors only. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
making one party a partner, joint venturer, agent or legal representative of
the other or otherwise as having the power or authority to bind the other in
any manner. It is the understanding and intention of the parties hereto that
the execution of, and performance under, this Agreement shall create no "joint
employer" relationship between them.

  



  

(d)   _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all
Schedules), the Purchase Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings among the parties with respect thereto. In the event of any
conflict between this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, the terms of the
Purchase Agreement shall control.

  



  

(e)   _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law in
any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision of
this Agreement in such jurisdiction or affect the validity, legality or
enforceability of any provision in any other jurisdiction, and the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision shall be interpreted and applied so as to
produce as near as may be the economic result intended by the parties. Upon
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to eliminate such invalidity, illegality or
incapability of enforcement and to effect the original intent of the Parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereunder are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

(f)   _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned by any party (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other party, and any such assignment shall be
null and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Hertz may assign some or
all of its rights or delegate some or all of its obligations hereunder to
successor entities pursuant to a plan of reorganization confirmed or a
liquidation approved by the Bankruptcy Court. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties and their permitted assigns, and nothing herein,
express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any other person any
legal or equitable benefit, Claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any
kind.

  



  

   

-12-

 



    



  

(g)   _Counterparts_. This Agreement and each other agreement or
instrument entered into in connection herewith or therewith or contemplated
hereby or thereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, may be executed in
one (1) or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original
of this Agreement or such amendment and all of which, when taken together,
will constitute one and the same instrument, and to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a photographic, photostatic, facsimile,
portable document format (.pdf), or similar reproduction of such signed
writing using a facsimile machine or electronic mail shall be treated in all
manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be
considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original
signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or
electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a
facsimile machine or electronic mail as a defense to the formation or
enforceability of a contract and each such party forever waives any such
defense.

  



  

(h)   _Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth herein, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid
by the party incurring such cost or expense.

  



  

(i)   _Headings; Interpretation_. The descriptive headings
contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Each reference in this Agreement to a Section or Schedule, unless
otherwise indicated, shall mean a Section of this Agreement or a Schedule
attached to this Agreement, respectively. References herein to "days," unless
otherwise indicated, are to consecutive calendar days. The
parties participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement and the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent. If an ambiguity
or question of intent or interpretation arises, then this Agreement will
accordingly be construed as drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption
or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of
the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. For the
purposes of determining whether any amount of local currency exceeds or is
less than any U.S. Dollar amount referred to in this Agreement, the exchange
rate prevailing on the relevant date (or, if the relevant date is not a
Business Day, on the immediately preceding Business Day) as published by _The
Wall Street Journal_ shall be used. The terms "hereby," "hereto," 
"hereunder" and any similar terms as used in this Agreement refer to this
Agreement in its entirety and not only to the particular portion of this
Agreement where the term is used. The term "or" shall not be exclusive. The
terms "including,"  "includes" or similar terms when used herein means
"including, without limitation." The meaning of defined terms shall be
equally applicable to the singular and plural forms of the defined terms, and
the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders, and vice
versa, as the context shall require. Any reference to any federal, state,
provincial, territorial, local or foreign statute or Law shall be deemed also
to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. When calculating the period of time before which,
within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant
to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such
period will be excluded. If the last day of such period is a day other than a
Business Day, the period in question will end on the next succeeding Business
Day. Any reference to "days" means calendar days unless Business Days are
expressly specified. The word "will" shall be construed to have the same
meaning and effect as the word "shall." The word "including" or any variation
thereof means "including, without limitation" and will not construed to limit
any general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or
matters immediately following it. When a reference is made in this Agreement
to a Section, Article, Exhibit or Schedule such reference shall be to a
Section, Article, Exhibit or Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated.

(j) _Governing Law_. Except to the extent the mandatory provisions
of the Bankruptcy Code apply, this Agreement, and all Claims and causes of
action arising out of, based upon, or related to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by, and
construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Delaware, without regard to choice or conflict of law principles that
would result in the application of any Laws other than the Laws of the State
of Delaware.

  



  

(k)   _Submission to Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(i) Any action, Claim, suit or Proceeding arising out of, based upon or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
brought solely in the Bankruptcy Court (or any court exercising appellate
jurisdiction over the Bankruptcy Court). Each party hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court (or any court
exercising appellate jurisdiction over the Bankruptcy Court) in respect of
any action, Claim, suit or Proceeding arising out of, based upon or relating
to this Agreement or any of the rights and obligations arising hereunder, and
agrees that it will not bring any action arising out of, based upon or
related thereto in any other court; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if the
Bankruptcy Cases is dismissed, any action, Claim, suit or Proceeding arising
out of, based upon or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be heard and determined solely in the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within
the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or
federal court within the State of Delaware and any direct appellate court
therefrom). Each party hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as
a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such action, Claim, suit or
Proceeding, (a) any Claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve process in accordance with _Section 13(a)_ , (b) any Claim that it
or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any Claim that (i) the suit, action or
Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue
of such suit, action or Proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement or any
other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or entered into in
connection herewith, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Each party agrees that notice or the service
of process in any action, Claim, suit or Proceeding arising out of, based upon
or relating to this Agreement or any of the rights and obligations arising
hereunder or thereunder, shall be properly served or delivered if
delivered in the manner contemplated by _Section 13(a)_.

  



  

(ii) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, CLAIM, SUIT OR PROCEEDING (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE) BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO ARISING OUT OF, BASED UPON OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE
HEREOF.

  



  

   

-14-

 



    



  

(l) _Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached
or threatened to be breached and that an award of money damages would be
inadequate in such event. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that the parties
hereto and the third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement shall be entitled
to equitable relief, without proof of actual damages, including an injunction
or injunctions or Orders for specific performance to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. Each party
hereto further agrees that no other party hereto or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in
this  _Section 13(l)_ , and each party hereto (i) irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or similar instrument, subject only to the immediately succeeding
sentence, and (ii) agrees to cooperate fully in any attempt by the other
parties hereto in obtaining such equitable relief. Each party hereto further
agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any
action for equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement.

  



  

(m)   _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement and any Schedule
hereto may not be amended, supplemented or modified except by a written
instrument executed by all parties to this Agreement. No waiver by any party
hereto of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless expressly
set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by the party so
waiving. Either party's waiver of any of its remedies afforded hereunder or
at law is without prejudice and shall not operate to waive any other
remedies which that party shall have available to it, nor shall such waiver
operate to waive any party's rights to any remedies due to a future breach,
whether of a similar or different nature. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof.

  



  

(n)   _Disclosure Generally_. All Schedules attached hereto are
incorporated herein and expressly made part of this Agreement as though
completely set forth herein. All references to this Agreement herein or in any
of the Schedules or in any agreement contemplated hereby shall be deemed to
refer to this entire Agreement, including all Schedules.

  



  

(o)  Survival. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the
obligations of each party set forth in Sections 1(e), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11
and 13 hereof shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

FOUND, DETERMINED, AND CONCLUDED THAT:5

C. _Legal Predicates_. The predicates for the relief
requested by this Motion are sections 105, 363, 365, and 503 of the Bankruptcy
Code and Bankruptcy Rules 2002, 6004, 6006, 9007, and 9014 and Rule 6004-1 of
the Local Rules for the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
Delaware (the "Local Rules").

  



  

D. _Petition Date_. On May 22, 2020 (the "Petition Date"), the
Debtors each commenced a case by filing a petition for relief under chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code.

  



  

E. _Bidding Procedures Order_. On [*], 2020, this Court
entered the Bidding Procedures Order (i) approving the Bidding Procedures for
the sale of the Donlen Assets;

  

(ii) authorizing the Debtors to enter into the Stalking Horse APA (as such
term is defined in the Motion) and approving the Termination Fee, Buyer
Expense Payment Amount, Option Fee and the Catch-Up Fee; (iii) scheduling the
Auction and Sale Hearing; (iv) approving form and manner of notice of
all procedures, protections, schedules and agreements; (v) establishing the
Assumption and Assignment Procedures, including notice of proposed cure
amounts (the "Cure Amounts"); and (v) granting related relief.

  



  

F. _Compliance with Bidding Procedures Order_. As
demonstrated by (i) the [*] Declaration, (ii) the testimony and other
evidence proffered or adduced at the Sale Hearing, and (iii) the
representations of counsel made on the record at the Sale Hearing, the
Debtors have marketed the Donlen Assets and conducted the sale process in
compliance with the Bidding Procedures Order, and the Auction was duly
noticed and conducted in a non-collusive, fair and good faith manner.
The Debtors and their professionals conducted the sale process in compliance
with the Bidding Procedures Order, and have afforded potential purchasers a
full and fair opportunity to make higher and better offers. The Purchaser has
acted in good faith and in compliance with the terms of the Bidding
Procedures. In accordance with the Bidding Procedures, the Debtors determined
that the bid submitted by the Purchaser and memorialized by the Asset
Purchase Agreement is the Successful Bid (as defined in the
Bidding Procedures). The Asset Purchase Agreement constitutes the highest and
best offer for the Donlen Assets, and will provide a greater recovery for the
Debtors' estates than would be provided by any other available alternative.
The Debtors' determination that the Asset Purchase Agreement constitutes the
highest and best offer for the Donlen Assets constitutes a valid and sound
exercise of the Debtors' business judgment.

G. _Notice_. As evidenced by the affidavits of service and
publication previously filed with the Court, and based on the representations
of counsel at the Sale Hearing, (i) proper, timely, adequate and sufficient
notice of the Motion, the Bidding Procedures, the Auction, the Sale Hearing,
the Sale Transaction, the Assumption and Assignment Procedures (including the
objection deadline with respect to any Cure Amount) and the assumption and
assignment of the Assigned Contracts, and the Cure Amounts has been provided
in accordance with sections 102(1), 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code,
Bankruptcy Rules 2002, 6004 and 6006 and Local Rules 2002-1, 6004-1, and
9013-1 and in compliance with the Bidding Procedures Order, (ii)  such notice
was good and sufficient, and appropriate under the particular circumstances,
and (iii) no other or further notice of the Motion, the Bidding Procedures,
the Auction, the Sale Hearing, the Sale Transaction, the Assumption and
Assignment Procedures (including the objection deadline with respect to any
Cure Amount) or the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts, or
the Cure Amounts is or shall be required. With respect to entities whose
identities are not reasonably ascertained by the Debtors, publication of the
Sale Notice (as defined in the Motion) in _The Wall Street Journal, The New
York Times, USA Today, and The Globe and Mail_ on [*], 2020, was sufficient
and reasonably calculated under the circumstances to reach such entities.

  

 _ _

 _ _

  

H.  Notice of the Donlen Debtors' assumption, assignment,
transfer, and/or sale to the Purchaser of the Assigned Contracts has been
provided to each non-Debtor party thereto, together with a statement therein
from the Debtors with respect to the Cure Amount. As to each Assigned
Contract, the Cure Amount set forth on _Schedule 1_ hereto is sufficient for
the Donlen Debtors to comply fully with the requirements of sections
365(b)(1)(A) and (B) of the Bankruptcy Code. Each of the non-Debtor parties
to the Assigned Contracts has had an opportunity to object to the Cure Amounts
set forth in _[The Donlen Debtors ' Notice of Intent to Assume, Assign,
Transfer, and/or Sell Certain Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases _[Dkt.
No. [*]].

  



  

I.   _Corporate Authority_. Hertz and each Donlen Debtor (i)
has full corporate power and authority to execute the Asset Purchase
Agreement and all other documents contemplated thereby (collectively, the
"Transaction Documents"), and the Sale Transaction has been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action of each of the applicable
Debtors, (ii) has all of the corporate power and authority necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, (iii)
has taken all corporate action and formalities necessary to authorize and
approve the Transaction Documents and the consummation by Hertz and the
Donlen Debtors of the transactions contemplated thereby, including as required
by their respective organizational documents and (iv) no government,
regulatory or other consents or approvals, other than those expressly provided
for in the Transaction Documents, are required for Hertz and the Donlen
Debtors to enter into the Transaction Documents and consummate the Sale
Transaction.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

J.   _Opportunity to Object_. A fair and reasonable opportunity
to object and to be heard with respect to the Motion and the relief requested
therein, has been given to all interested persons and entities, including the
following: (i) all counterparties to the Assigned Contracts, (ii) all parties
holding or asserting Interests on, in or against the Donlen Assets, (iii) all
parties listed on the Master Services List, (iv) all creditors of Donlen
Corp., and (v) all applicable federal, state and local taxing and regulatory
authorities.

  



  

K.   _Sale in Best Interest_. Consummation of the sale of the
Donlen Assets at this time is in the best interests of the Debtors, their
creditors, their estates and other parties in interest.

  



  

L. _Business Justification_. Sound business reasons exist for
the Sale Transaction. Entry into the Transaction Documents, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Sale
Transaction and the assumption and assignment of the Assigned
Contracts, constitutes an exercise of the Debtors' sound business judgment
and such acts are in the best interests of each Debtor, its estate, and all
parties in interest. The Court finds that each Debtor has articulated good and
sufficient business reasons justifying the Sale Transaction. Such business
reasons include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the Asset
Purchase Agreement constitutes the highest and best offer for the Donlen
Assets; (ii) the consideration to be received by the Debtors will consist
entirely of cash, which provides immediate liquidity and certainty of value
for the Debtors and this certainty of value is compelling compared to the
uncertain long term value potential when accounting for the risks of
continuing to operate the Donlen Assets, particularly the risks inherent in
operating while in bankruptcy and in a very uncertain business climate and the
potential for devaluation of the Assets; (iii) the Purchaser has agreed to
assume the Assumed Liabilities; and (iv) unless the Sale Transaction and all
of the other transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement are
concluded expeditiously, as provided for in the Motion, the Bidding
Procedures, and pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, recoveries to
creditors may be diminished.

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

M.  The Debtors and their professionals actively marketed the
Donlen Assets to potential purchasers, as set forth in the Motion and in
accordance with the Bidding Procedures Order. The bidding and auction process
set forth in the Bidding Procedures Order and the Bidding Procedures afforded
a full and fair opportunity for any entity to make a higher or otherwise
better offer to purchase the Donlen Assets. Based upon the record of these
proceedings, all creditors and other parties in interest and all
prospective bidders have been afforded a reasonable and fair opportunity to
bid for the Donlen Assets.

  



  

N.  No other person or entity or group of persons or entities
has offered to purchase the Donlen Assets for an amount that would give equal
or greater economic value to the Debtors in the aggregate than the value being
provided by the Purchaser pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement. Among
other things, the Sale Transaction is the best alternative available to the
Debtors to maximize the return to their estates. The terms and conditions of
the Asset Purchase Agreement, including the consideration to be realized by
the Debtors, are fair and reasonable. Approval of the Motion, the Asset
Purchase Agreement, and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
Sale Transaction and the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts,
is in the best interests of the Debtors, their estates and creditors, and all
other parties in interest.

  



  

O.   _Arms-Length Sale_. The Transaction Documents were
negotiated, proposed and entered into by the Debtors and the
Purchaser without collusion, in good faith, and from arm's-length bargaining
positions. None of the Debtors, the Purchaser, any other party in interest,
or any of their respective representatives has engaged in any conduct that
would cause or permit the Transaction Documents, or the consummation of the
Sale Transaction, to be avoidable or avoided, or for costs or damages to be
imposed, under 11 U.S.C. § 363(n), or has acted in bad faith or in any
improper or collusive manner with any entity in connection
therewith. Specifically, the Purchaser has not acted in a collusive manner
with any person and the purchase price was not controlled by any agreement
among bidders. The Purchaser is not an "Insider" of the Debtors as defined in
Bankruptcy Code section 101(31).

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

P.   _Good Faith Purchaser_. The Purchaser is a good faith
purchaser for value and, as such, is entitled to all of the protections
afforded under 11 U.S.C. § 363(m) and any other applicable or similar
bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy law. Specifically: (i) the Purchaser recognized
that the Debtors were free to deal with any other party interested in
purchasing the Donlen Assets; (ii) the Purchaser complied in all respects
with the provisions in the Bidding Procedures Order; (iii) the Purchaser
agreed to subject its bid to the competitive Bidding Procedures set forth in
the Bidding Procedures Order; (iv) all payments to be made by the Purchaser
in connection with the Sale Transaction have been disclosed; (v) no common
identity of directors, officers or controlling stockholders exists among the
Purchaser and the Debtors; (vi) the negotiation and execution of the
Transaction Documents were at arm's-length and in good faith, and at all
times each of the Purchaser and the Debtors were represented by competent
counsel of their choosing; (vii) the Purchaser did not in any way induce or
cause the chapter 11 filing of the Debtors; and (viii) the Purchaser has not
acted in a collusive manner with any person. The Purchaser will be acting in
good faith within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. § 363(m) in closing the
transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement.

  



  

   

9

 



    



  

Q.   _Free and Clear_. The Debtors may sell the Donlen Assets
free and clear of all Encumbrances, Claims, rights, obligations, liabilities
and other interests of any kind or nature whatsoever against the Debtors or
the Purchased Assets (other than Permitted Encumbrances and the Assumed
Liabilities), including, without limitation, other than Permitted Encumbrances
and the Assumed Liabilities, any liabilities, debts or obligations arising
under or out of, in connection with, or in any way relating to, any acts or
omissions, agreements, suits, demands, guaranties, contractual commitments,
licenses, restrictions, options, environmental liabilities, labor and
employment claims, employee pension or benefit plan claims, multiemployer
benefit plan claims, workers' compensation claims, claims for taxes of or
against the Debtors or their assets, any derivative, vicarious, transfer or
successor liability claims, and any other rights or causes of action (whether
in law or in equity, under any law, statute, rule or regulation of the United
States, any state, territory, or possession thereof or the District of
Columbia), whether arising prior to or subsequent to the commencement of
these chapter 11 cases, whether known or unknown, matured or unmatured,
liquidated or unliquidated, or contingent or non-contingent, and whether
imposed by agreement, understanding, law, equity or otherwise, arising under
or out of, in connection with, or in any way related to the Debtors (or their
predecessors), the Debtors' interests in the Purchased Assets, the operation
of the Debtors' businesses before the Closing, or the transfer of the Debtors'
interests in the Purchased Assets to Purchaser, and all Excluded Liabilities
(collectively, and excluding any Permitted Encumbrances and
Assumed Liabilities, the "Interests"), because, with respect to each creditor
asserting an Interest, one or more of the standards set forth in Bankruptcy
Code § 363(f)(1)-(5) has been satisfied. Each entity with an Interest in the
Donlen Assets to be transferred pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement: (i)
has, subject to the terms and conditions of this Order, consented to the Sale
Transaction or is deemed to have consented; (ii) could be compelled in a legal
or equitable proceeding to accept money satisfaction of such Interest; or
(iii) otherwise falls within one or more of the other subsections of section
363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. Those holders of Interests who did not object
or withdrew objections to the Sale Transaction are deemed to have consented
to the Sale Transaction pursuant to section 363(f)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

R.  The Purchaser would not have entered into the Asset Purchase
Agreement and would not consummate the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Sale Transaction and the assumption and assignment of the
Assigned Contracts, (i) if the transfer of the Donlen Assets were not free
and clear of all Interests, including rights or claims based on any successor
or transferee liability, of any kind or nature whatsoever (except as
expressly set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement or this Order with respect
to Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities) or (ii) if the Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates, past, present and future members or shareholders,
lenders, subsidiaries, parents, divisions, funds, agents, representatives,
insurers, attorneys, successors and assigns, or any of their respective
directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, representatives, attorneys,
contractors, subcontractors, independent contractors, owners, insurance
companies, or partners (collectively, "Purchaser Parties") would, or in the
future could, be liable for any such Interest. The Purchaser will not
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement,
including the Sale Transaction and the assumption and assignment of the
Assigned Contracts, unless this Court expressly orders that none of the
Purchaser, the other Purchaser Parties, or the Donlen Assets will have any
Liability whatsoever with respect to, or be required to satisfy in any
manner, whether at law or equity, or by payment, setoff, or
otherwise, directly or indirectly, any Interest.

  



  

S.  Not transferring the Donlen Assets free and clear of all
Interests would adversely impact the Debtors' efforts to maximize the value
of their estates, and the transfer of the Donlen Assets other than pursuant to
a transfer that is free and clear of all Interests would be of substantially
less benefit to the Debtors' estates.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

T.   _Assumption of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases_.
Except as set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement the (i) transfer of the
Donlen Assets to the Purchaser and (ii) assignment to the Purchaser of the
Assigned Contracts, will not subject the Purchaser or the Purchaser Parties
to any Liability whatsoever prior to the Closing Date (as defined below) or by
reason of such transfer under the laws of the United States, any state,
territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, based, in
whole or in part, directly or indirectly, on any theory of law or equity,
including any theory of equitable law, including any theory of antitrust,
successor or transferee liability. The Debtors have demonstrated that it is an
exercise of their sound business judgment to assume and assign the Assigned
Contracts to the Purchaser in connection with the consummation of the
Sale Transaction, and the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts
is in the best interests of the Debtors and their estates. The Assigned
Contracts being assigned to the Purchaser are an integral part of the Donlen
Assets being purchased by the Purchaser and, accordingly, such assumption and
assignment of Assigned Contracts is reasonable, enhances the value of the
Debtors' estates, and does not constitute unfair discrimination.

  



  

U.   _Cure/Adequate Assurance_. The Debtors and the Purchaser
have (i) cured, or has provided adequate assurance of cure, of any default
existing prior to the date hereof under any of the Assigned Contracts, within
the meaning of 11 U.S.C. §§ 365(b)(1)(A) and 365(f)(2)(A), and (ii) provided
compensation or adequate assurance of compensation to any party for any
actual pecuniary loss to such party resulting from a default prior to the
date hereof under any of the Assigned Contracts within the meaning of 11
U.S.C. § 365(b)(1)(B). The Purchaser has provided or will provide adequate
assurance of future performance of and under the Assigned Contracts within
the meaning of 11 U.S.C. §§ 365(b)(1)(C) and 365(f)(2)(B).

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

V.   _Prompt Consummation_. The sale of the Donlen Assets must
be approved and consummated promptly in order to preserve the value of the
Donlen Assets. Therefore, time is of the essence in consummating the Sale
Transaction, and the Debtors and the Purchaser intend to close the Sale
Transaction as soon as reasonably practicable. The Debtors have demonstrated
compelling circumstances and a good, sufficient, and sound business purpose
and justification for the immediate approval and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, including the Sale
Transaction. The Purchaser, being a good faith purchaser under section 363(m)
of the Bankruptcy Code, may close the Sale Transaction contemplated by the
Asset Purchase Agreement at any time after entry of this Order, subject to
the terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Accordingly, there
is cause to lift the stay contemplated by Bankruptcy Rules 6004 and 6006 with
regards to the transactions contemplated by this Order.

  



  

W.   _No Fraudulent Transfer_. The Transaction Documents were not
entered into for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors
under the Bankruptcy Code or under the laws of the United States, any state,
territory, possession or the District of Columbia, and none of the parties to
the Transaction Documents are consummating the Sale Transaction for any
other fraudulent or otherwise improper purpose.

  



  

X.  The consideration provided by the Purchaser for the Donlen
Assets pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement (i) is fair and reasonable,
(ii) is the highest and best offer for the Donlen Assets, (iii) will provide a
greater recovery for the Debtors' creditors than would be provided by any
other practical available alternative, and (iv) constitutes reasonably
equivalent value, fair consideration and fair value under the Bankruptcy Code
and under the laws of the United States, any state, territory, possession or
the District of Columbia (including the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the
Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, and the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act),
and any other applicable law.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

Y. _Purchaser Not an Insider and No Successor Liability_.
Immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser was not an "insider" or
"affiliate" of the Debtors, as those terms are defined in the Bankruptcy Code,
and no common identity of incorporators, directors or stockholders existed
between the Purchaser and the Debtors. The transfer of the Donlen Assets and
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities (including any individual elements
of the Sale Transaction) to the Purchaser, except as otherwise set forth in
the Asset Purchase Agreement, does not, and will not, subject the Purchaser to
any Liability whatsoever, with respect to the operation of the Debtors'
businesses prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction or by reason of such
transfer under the laws of the United States, any state, territory, or
possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, based, in whole or in part,
directly or indirectly, in any theory of law or equity including any laws
affecting antitrust, successor, transferee or vicarious Liability. Pursuant
to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser is not purchasing all of the
Donlen Debtors' assets in that the Purchaser is not purchasing any of the
Excluded Assets or assuming the Excluded Liabilities, and the Purchaser is
not holding itself out to the public as a continuation of the Debtors. The
Purchaser, as a result of any action taken in connection with the Sale
Transaction, is not a successor to or a mere continuation, of any of the
Debtors or their respective estates and there is no continuity between the
Purchaser and the Debtors. The Sale Transaction does not amount to a
consolidation, merger or _de facto_ merger of the Purchaser and the Debtors
and/or the Debtors' estates. There is not substantial continuity between the
Purchaser and the Debtors, and there is no continuity of enterprise between
the Debtors and the Purchaser. The Purchaser does not constitute a successor
to the Debtors or the Debtors' estates.

  



  

   

14

 



    



  

Z. _Legal, Valid Transfer_. The Debtors have full corporate
power and authority (i) to perform all of their obligations under the
Transaction Documents and (ii) to consummate the Sale Transaction. The
transfer of the Donlen Assets to the Purchaser will be a legal, valid, and
effective transfer of the Donlen Assets, and will vest the Purchaser with all
right, title, and interest of the Debtors to the Donlen Assets free and clear
of all Interests, as set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Donlen
Assets constitute property of the Donlen Debtors' estates and good title is
vested in the Donlen Debtors' estates within the meaning of section 541(a) of
the Bankruptcy Code. The Donlen Debtors are the sole and rightful owners of
the Donlen Assets, and no other person has any ownership right, title, or
interests therein.

  



  

AA. _Not a Sub Rosa Plan_. The Sale Transaction does not
constitute a _sub rosa_ chapter 11 plan or an element of such plan for the
Debtors, for which approval has been sought without the protections that a
disclosure statement would afford. The Sale Transaction does not (i)
impermissibly restructure the rights of the Debtors' creditors or equity
interest holders, (ii) impair or circumvent voting rights with respect to any
future plan proposed by the Debtors, (iii) impermissibly dictate a plan of
reorganization for the Debtors; or (vi) classify claims or equity
interests, compromise controversies, or extend debt maturities.

  



  

BB. _Legal and Factual Bases_. The legal and factual bases set
forth in the Motion and at the Sale Hearing establish just cause for
the relief granted herein.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED THAT:

  



  

 _General Provisions_

 _Sale and Transfer of the Donlen Assets_

  



  

6.  The consideration provided by the Purchaser for the Donlen Assets under the Asset Purchase Agreement is fair and reasonable and shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute reasonably equivalent value, fair value, and fair consideration under the Bankruptcy Code and the laws of the United States, any state, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia including without limitation the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, and any other applicable law.

17

 



    



  

9.  Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§ 105, 363 and 365, the Debtors are hereby authorized and directed to, and shall, take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to (a) sell the Donlen Assets to the Purchaser, (b) consummate the Sale Transaction in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Transaction Documents, and (c) transfer and assign all right, title and interest (including common law rights) to all property, licenses and rights to be conveyed in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the Transaction Documents, in each case without further notice to or order of this Court. The Debtors are further authorized and directed to execute and deliver, and are empowered to perform under, consummate and implement, the Transaction Documents, together with all additional instruments and documents that may be reasonably necessary or desirable to implement the Asset Purchase Agreement, including the related documents, exhibits and schedules, and to take all further actions as may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser for the purposes of assigning, transferring, granting, conveying and conferring to the Purchaser or reducing to possession, the Donlen Assets, or as may be necessary or appropriate to the performance of the Debtors' obligations as contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement without further notice to or order of this Court.

  



  

10.  Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§ 363(b) and 363(f), the Donlen Assets shall be transferred to the Purchaser upon consummation of the Asset Purchase Agreement (such date, the "Closing Date") free and clear of all Interests. The provisions of this Order authorizing and approving the transfer of the Donlen Assets free and clear of all Interests shall be self-executing, and neither the Debtors nor the Purchaser shall be required to execute or file releases, termination statements, assignments, consents, or other instruments in order to effectuate, consummate, and implement the provisions of this Order.

  



  

   

18

 



    



  

11.  Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser may, but shall not be required to, file a certified copy of this Order in any filing or recording office in any federal, state, county, or other jurisdiction in which the Debtors are incorporated or has real or personal property, or with any other appropriate clerk or recorded with any other appropriate recorder, and such filing or recording shall be accepted and shall be sufficient to release, discharge, and terminate any of the Interests as set forth in this Order as of the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, this Order will be construed, and constitute for any and all purposes, a full and complete general assignment, conveyance and transfer of the Donlen Assets or a bill of sale transferring good and marketable title in such assets to the Purchaser. On the Closing Date, this Order also shall be construed, and constitute for any and all purposes, a complete and general assignment of all right, title and interest of the Donlen Debtors and each bankruptcy estate to the Purchaser in the Assigned Contracts. Each and every federal, state, and local governmental agency or department is hereby directed to accept any and all documents and instruments necessary and appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement.

  



  

12.  All entities who are presently, or on the Closing Date may be, in possession of some or all of the Donlen Assets are hereby directed to surrender possession of the Donlen Assets to the Purchaser on the Closing Date.

13.  Except as expressly permitted by the Asset Purchase Agreement or this Order, all persons and entities, including, but not limited to, all debt security holders, equity security holders, governmental, tax, and regulatory authorities, lenders, trade creditors, dealers, employees, litigation claimants, and other creditors, holding Interests against or in a Debtor or the Donlen Assets (whether legal or equitable, secured or unsecured, matured or unmatured, contingent or noncontingent, senior or subordinated), arising under or out of, in connection with, or in any way relating to, the Debtors, the Donlen Assets or the operation of the Donlen Assets before the Closing Date, or the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, including the Sale Transaction and the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts, are forever barred, estopped, and permanently enjoined from asserting, prosecuting, or otherwise pursuing such persons' or entities' Interests, whether by payment, setoff, or otherwise, directly or indirectly, against the Purchaser, Purchaser Parties, or any successors or assigns, their respective property and the Donlen Assets. Following the closing of the Sale Transaction, no party shall interfere with the Purchaser's title to or use and enjoyment of the Donlen Assets based on or related to any such Interest or based on any action the Debtors may take in the Chapter 11 Cases.

  



  

14.  On the Closing Date of the Sale Transaction, each of the Debtors' creditors is authorized and directed to execute such documents and take all other actions as may be necessary to release its Interests in or against the Donlen Assets, if any, as such Interests may have been recorded or otherwise exist.

  



  

15.  To the extent provided by section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code, no governmental unit may deny, revoke, suspend, or refuse to renew any permit, license or similar grant relating to the operation of the Donlen Assets on account of the filing or pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, including the Sale Transaction and the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts. Each and every federal, state, and local governmental agency or department is hereby authorized and directed to accept any and all documents and instruments necessary and appropriate to consummate the Sale set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  



  

16. To the greatest extent available under applicable law and to the extent provided for under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser shall be authorized, as of the Closing Date, to operate under any license, permit, registration, and governmental authorization or approval of the Donlen Debtors with respect to the Donlen Assets, and, to the greatest extent available under applicable law and to the extent provided for under the Asset Purchase Agreement, all such licenses, permits, registrations, and governmental authorizations and approvals are deemed to have been transferred to the Purchaser as of the Closing Date.

  



  

17. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Order, the transfer of the Donlen Assets to the Purchaser pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement constitutes a legal, valid, and effective transfer of the Donlen Assets, and shall vest the Purchaser with all right, title, and interest of the Debtors in and to the Donlen Assets free and clear of all Interests.

  



  

 _No Successor Liability_

  



  

18. The Purchaser is not a "successor" to the Debtors or their estates by reason of any theory of law or equity, and the Purchaser shall not assume, or be deemed to assume, or in any way be responsible for any Liability or obligation of any of the Debtors and/or their estates, other than the Assumed Liabilities, with respect to the Donlen Assets or otherwise, including, but not limited to, under any bulk sales law, doctrine or theory of successor liability, or similar theory or basis of Liability except for the assumption of the Transaction Documents. Except to the extent the Purchaser assumes Assumed Liabilities and is ultimately permitted to assume the Assigned Contracts pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, neither the purchase of the Donlen Assets by the Purchaser nor the fact that the Purchaser is using any of the Donlen Assets previously operated by the Debtors will cause the Purchaser to be deemed a successor in any respect to the Debtors' businesses or incur any Liability derived therefrom within the meaning of any foreign, federal, state or local revenue, pension, ERISA, tax, labor, employment, environmental, or other law, rule or regulation (including filing requirements under any such laws, rules or regulations), or under any products liability law or doctrine with respect to the Debtors' Liability under such law, rule or regulation or doctrine.

  



  

   

 | 21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

19. The Purchaser has given substantial consideration under the Asset Purchase Agreement, which consideration shall constitute valid and valuable consideration for the releases of any potential claims of successor liability against the Purchaser and which shall be deemed to have been given in favor of the Purchaser by all holders of Interests in or against the Debtors, or the Donlen Assets. Upon consummation of the Sale Transaction, the Purchaser shall not be deemed to (a) be the successor to the Debtors, (b) have,  _de facto_ or otherwise, merged with or into the Debtors, or (c) be a mere continuation, alter ego or substantial continuation of the Debtors.

  



  

20. Except to the extent the Purchaser has specifically agreed in the Asset Purchase Agreement or as otherwise set forth in this Order, the Purchaser shall not have any Liability, responsibility or obligation for any claims, liabilities or other obligations of the Debtors or their estates, including any claims, liabilities or other obligations related to the Donlen Assets prior to Closing Date. Under no circumstances shall the Purchaser be deemed a successor of or to the Debtors for any Interests against, in or to the Debtors or the Donlen Assets. For the purposes of this section of this Order, all references to the Purchaser shall also include the Purchaser Parties.

  



  

   

 | 22| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

 _Good Faith_

  



  

21. The transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents are undertaken by the Purchaser without collusion and in good faith, as that term is used in section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, and accordingly, the reversal or modification on appeal of the authorization provided herein by this Order to consummate the Sale Transaction shall not alter, affect, limit, or otherwise impair the validity of the sale of the Donlen Assets to the Purchaser, including the assumption, assignment, and/or transfer of the Assigned Contracts. The Purchaser is a good faith purchaser of the Donlen Assets within the meaning of section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code and, as such is entitled to, and is hereby granted, the full rights, benefits, privileges and protections of section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors and the Purchaser will be acting in good faith if they proceed to consummate the Sale at any time after the entry of this Order.

  



  

22. As a good faith purchaser of the Donlen Assets, the Purchaser has not entered into an agreement with any other potential bidders at the Auction, and has not colluded with any of the other bidders, potential bidders or any other parties interested in the Donlen Assets, and, therefore, neither the Debtors nor any successor in interest to the Debtors' estates shall be entitled to bring an action against the Purchaser, and the Sale Transaction may not be avoided pursuant to section 363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code, and no party shall be entitled to any damages or other recovery pursuant to section 363(n) in respect of the Asset Purchase Agreement or the Sale Transaction.

  



  

 _Assumption and Assignment of Assigned Contracts_

  



  

23. Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§ 105(a), 363 and 365, and subject to and conditioned upon the Closing Date, the Debtors' assumption and assignment to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser's assumption on the terms set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, of the Assigned Contracts is hereby approved, and the requirements of 11 U.S.C. § 365(b)(1) with respect thereto are hereby deemed satisfied.

  



  

   

 | 23| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

24. The Debtors are hereby authorized and directed in accordance with 11 U.S.C. §§ 105(a), 363 and 365 to (a) assume and assign to the Purchaser, effective upon the Closing Date of the Sale Transaction, the Assigned Contracts free and clear of all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever and (b) execute and deliver to the Purchaser such documents or other instruments as may be necessary to assign and transfer the Assigned Contracts to the Purchaser.

  



  

25. The Assigned Contracts shall be transferred to, and remain in full force and effect for the benefit of, the Purchaser in accordance with their respective terms, notwithstanding any provision in any such Assigned Contract (including those of the type described in sections 365(b)(2) and (f) of the Bankruptcy Code) that prohibits, restricts, or conditions such assignment or transfer and, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 365(k), the Debtors shall be relieved from any further Liability with respect to the Assigned Contracts after such assignment to and assumption by the Purchaser, except as provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

  



  

26. All counterparties to the Assigned Contracts shall be deemed to have consented to such assumption and assignment under section 365(c)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code and any other applicable law and the Buyer shall enjoy all of the Debtors' rights, benefits, and privileges under each such Assigned Contract as of the applicable date of assumption and assignment without the necessity to obtain any non-Debtor parties' written consent to the assumption or assignment thereof.

  



  

   

 | 24| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

27. Upon the Debtors' assignment of the Assigned Contracts under the provisions of this Order, no default shall exist under any Assigned Contract and no counterparty to any such Assigned Contract shall be permitted to declare or enforce a default by the Debtor or the Purchaser thereunder or otherwise take action against the Purchaser relating to any of the Debtors' financial condition, change in control, bankruptcy or failure to perform any of its obligations under the relevant Assigned Contract. Any provision in an Assigned Contract that prohibits or conditions the assignment or sublease of such Assigned Contract (including the granting of a lien therein) or allows the counterparty thereto to terminate, recapture, impose any penalty, declare a default, condition on renewal or extension, or modify any term or condition upon such assignment, sublease, or change of control, constitutes an unenforceable anti-assignment provision that is void and of no force and effect only in connection with the assumption and assignment of such Assigned Contract to the Purchaser. The failure of the Debtors or the Purchaser to enforce at any time one or more terms or conditions of any Assigned Contract shall not be a waiver of such terms or conditions, or of the Debtors' and the Purchaser's rights to enforce every term and condition of the Assigned Contract. Nothing in this Order, the Motion, or in any notice or any other document is or shall be deemed an admission by the Debtors that any Assigned Contract is an executory contract or unexpired lease under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or, subject to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, must be assumed and assigned pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement or in order to consummate the Sale.

  



  

28. All defaults or other obligations of the Debtors under the Assigned Contracts arising or accruing prior to the date of this Order (without giving effect to any acceleration clauses or any default provisions of the kind specified in section 365(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code) shall be cured by the Buyer and/or the Purchaser (as provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement) on or prior to the Closing Date or as soon thereafter as reasonably practicable, and the Purchaser shall have no Liability or obligation arising or accruing prior to the Closing Date, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 25| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

29. As applicable, the Sale Transaction and assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts approved herein includes conveyance of all beneficial rights, easements, permits, licenses, servitudes, rights-of-way, surface leases and other surface rights, and all contracts, agreements, and instruments by which they are bound, appurtenant to, and used or held for use in connection with the Assigned Contracts.

  



  

30. Each non-Debtor party to an Assigned Contract hereby is forever barred, estopped, and permanently enjoined from raising or asserting against the Debtors, the Purchaser, the Purchaser Parties, or the property of such parties, any assignment fee, default, breach or claim of pecuniary loss, penalty, or condition to assignment, arising under or related to the Assigned Contracts, existing as of the date of the Sale Hearing, or arising by reason of the consummation of transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, including the Sale Transaction and the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts. Any party that may have had the right to consent to the assignment of an Assigned Contract or a change of control with respect to the Donlen Debtors is deemed to have consented to such assignment for purposes of section 365(e)(2)(A)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Code or change of control if such party failed to timely object to the assumption and assignment of such Assigned Contract.

  



  

31. The Purchaser shall not be required, pursuant to section 365(1) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, to provide any additional deposit or security with respect to any of the Assigned Contracts to the extent not previously provided by the Debtors.

  



  

32. To the extent a counterparty to an Assigned Contract failed to timely object to a Cure Amount, such Cure Amount shall be deemed to be finally determined and any such counterparty shall be prohibited from challenging, objecting to or denying the validity and finality of the Cure Amount at any time, and such Cure Amount, when paid, shall completely revive any Assigned Contract to which it relates.

  



  

   

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

33. Any Contract (as such term is defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) entered into by the Donlen Debtors after entry of this Order shall include a provision stating that such Contract will be assigned to the Purchaser on the Closing Date (unless otherwise requested by the Purchaser). If such language is not included in any such Contract, the Donlen Debtors are hereby directed to notify the counterparty to any such Contract that such Contract will be assigned to the Purchaser on the Closing Date. Any such Contract shall automatically be assigned to the Purchaser on the Closing Date in accordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement (unless otherwise requested by the Purchaser) without the need for further Court order.

  



  

 _Additional Provisions_

  



  

34. On the Closing Date, this Order shall be construed and shall constitute for any and all purposes a full and complete general assignment, conveyance, and transfer to the Purchaser of the Donlen Assets and the Debtors' interests in the Donlen Assets acquired by the Purchaser under the Asset Purchase Agreement. Each and every federal, state, and local governmental agency, court or department is directed to accept any and all documents and instruments necessary and appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement. On the Closing Date, the Debtors and the Purchaser are authorized to take such actions as may be necessary to obtain a release of any and all Interests in, on or against the Donlen Assets, if any, and to the extent contemplated hereby and by the Asset Purchase Agreement. This Order (a) shall be effective as a determination that, on the Closing Date all Interests of any kind or nature whatsoever existing as to the Donlen Assets prior to the Closing Date have been, and are, unconditionally released, discharged and terminated, and that the conveyances described herein have been effected, and (b) shall be binding upon and shall govern the acts of all entities including all filing agents, filing officers, title agents, title companies, recorders of mortgages, recorders of deeds, registrars of deeds, administrative agencies, governmental departments, secretaries of state, federal, state, and local officials, and all other persons and entities who may be required by operation of law, the duties of their office, or contract, to accept, file, register or otherwise record or release any documents or instruments, or who may be required to report or insure any title or state of title in or to any of the Donlen Assets. Each and every federal, state and local governmental agency or department is hereby directed to accept any and all documents and instruments necessary and appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Purchaser and the Debtors shall take such further steps and execute such further documents, assignments, instruments and papers as shall be reasonably requested by the other to implement and effectuate the transactions contemplated in this paragraph. All interests of record as of the date of this Order shall be forthwith deemed removed and stricken as against the Donlen Assets. All entities described in this paragraph are authorized and specifically directed to strike all such recorded Interests against the Donlen Assets from their records, official and otherwise.

  



  

   

 | 27| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

35. If any person or entity that has filed statements or other documents or agreements evidencing Interests in, on or against any of the Donlen Assets does not deliver to the Debtors or the Purchaser prior to the Closing Date, in proper form for filing and executed by the appropriate parties, termination statements, instruments of satisfaction, releases of liens and easements, and any other documents necessary for the purpose of documenting the release of all interests and other interests that the person or entity has or may assert with respect to any of the Donlen Assets in any required jurisdiction, the Debtors and/or the Purchaser are hereby authorized to execute and file such statements, instruments, releases and other documents on behalf of such persons or entity with respect to any of the Donlen Assets in any required jurisdiction. This Order constitutes authorization under all applicable jurisdictions and versions of the Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable law for the Purchaser to file UCC and other applicable termination statements with respect to all Interests in, on, or against the Donlen Assets.

  



  

36. Upon the Closing Date and pursuant to this Order, all conditions precedent in the Asset Purchase Agreement and all obligations of each of the Purchaser and the Debtors necessary to consummate the Transaction, including those obligations set forth in section 8 of the Asset Purchase Agreement, shall be deemed to have occurred in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

  



  

37. The Debtors will cooperate with the Purchaser and the Purchaser will cooperate with the Debtors, in each case to ensure that the transaction contemplated in the Asset Purchase Agreement is consummated, and the Debtors will make such modifications or supplements to any bill of sale or other document executed in connection with the closing to facilitate such consummation as contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

  



  

38. The terms and provisions of the Transaction Documents and this Order shall be binding in all respects upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Debtors and their respective affiliates, successors and assigns, their estates, and their creditors, the Purchaser, and its respective affiliates, successors and assigns, and any affected third parties including, but not limited to, all persons asserting Interests in, on or against the Donlen Assets to be sold to the Purchaser and all counterparties to the Assigned Contracts pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent appointment of any trustee(s) under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, as to which trustee(s) such terms and provisions likewise shall be binding.

  



  

   

 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

39. The failure specifically to include any particular provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement in this Order shall not diminish or impair the effectiveness of such provision, it being the intent of the Court that the Asset Purchase Agreement be authorized and approved in its entirety.

  



  

40. The Transaction Documents or any other instruments may be modified, amended or supplemented by the parties thereto, in a writing signed by both parties, and in accordance with the terms thereof, without further order of the Court, provided that any such modification, amendment or supplement does not have a material adverse effect on the Debtors' estates. To the extent that any provision of the Asset Purchase Agreement conflicts with or is, in any way, inconsistent with any provision of this Order, this Order shall govern and control. To the extent that this Order is inconsistent with any prior order or pleading with respect to the Motion, the terms of this Order shall govern.

  



  

41. Neither the Purchaser nor the Debtors shall have an obligation to close the Sale Transaction until all conditions precedent in the Asset Purchase Agreement to each of their respective obligations to close the Sale Transaction have been met, satisfied, or waived in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

  



  

42. Nothing in this Order shall modify or waive any closing conditions or termination rights set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, and all such conditions and rights shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

  



  

43. The Debtors are authorized to enter into any contract or amend any existing contract necessary to meet their obligations under the transition services agreement executed in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 29| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



     

44. Nothing contained in any plan of reorganization or liquidation confirmed in these Chapter 11 Cases or any order of this Court confirming such plans or in any other order in these Chapter 11 Cases, including any order entered after any conversion of these Chapter 11 Cases to a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, shall alter, conflict with, or derogate from, the provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement or the terms of this Order. To the extent of any such conflict or derogation, the terms of this Order shall govern. The provisions of this Order and the Asset Purchase Agreement and any actions taken pursuant hereto or thereto shall survive entry of any order which may be entered confirming or consummating any chapter 11 plan of the Debtors, or which may be entered converting these Chapter 11 Cases from chapter 11 to chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and the terms and provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement as well as the rights and interests granted pursuant to this Order and the Asset Purchase Agreement shall continue in these Chapter 11 Cases or any superseding case and shall be specifically performable and enforceable against and binding upon the Debtors, their estates, all creditors, all holders of equity interests in the Debtors, all holders of claim(s) (whether known or unknown) against the Debtors, all holders of interests (whether known or unknown) against, in or on all or any portion of the Donlen Assets, the Purchaser and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any trustee, responsible officer or other fiduciary hereafter appointed or elected as a legal representative of the Debtors under chapter 7 or chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code including without limitation plan fiduciaries, plan administrators, liquidating trustees.

  



  

45. Any and all valid and perfected liens or interests in the Donlen Assets shall attach to any proceeds of the Sale Transaction immediately upon receipt of such proceeds by the Debtors in the order of priority, and with the same validity, force and effect which they now have against such Donlen Assets, subject to any rights, claims, and defenses of the Debtors, the Debtors' estates or any trustee for any Debtor, as applicable, may possess with respect thereto; provided, however, that setoff rights will be extinguished to the extent there is no longer mutuality after the consummation of the Sale Transaction in addition to any limitations on the use of such proceeds pursuant to any provision of this Order.

  



  

46. Donlen Corp. is authorized and, to the fullest extent possible, directed to use proceeds from the Sale to repay the postpetition loans made by The Hertz Corporation to Donlen Corp.

  



  

47. The provisions of this Order are nonseverable and mutually dependent.

  



  

48. No bulk sales law or any similar law of any state or other jurisdiction applies in any way to the Sale Transaction.

  



  

49. The Debtors and each other person having duties or responsibilities under the Transaction Documents or this Order, and their respective agents, representatives, and attorneys, are authorized and empowered to carry out all of the provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, to issue, execute, deliver, file and record, as appropriate, the Asset Purchase Agreement, and any related agreements, and to take any action contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement or this Order, and to issue, execute, deliver, file and record, as appropriate, such other contracts, instruments, releases, deeds, bills of sale, assignments, or other agreements, and to perform such other acts as are consistent with, and necessary or appropriate to, implement, effectuate and consummate the Asset Purchase Agreement and this Order and the transactions contemplated thereby and hereby, all without further application to, or order of, the Court. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Order shall constitute all approvals and consents, if any, required by applicable business corporation, trust and other laws of applicable governmental units with respect to the implementation and consummation of the Asset Purchase Agreement and this Order and the transactions contemplated thereby and hereby. The transfer of the Donlen Assets to the Purchaser pursuant to the Transaction Documents do not require any consents other than specifically provided for in the Asset Purchase Agreement or as provided for herein.

  



  

   

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

50. Notwithstanding the provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 6004 and Bankruptcy Rule 6006 or any applicable provisions of the Local Rules, this Order shall not be stayed for fourteen (14) days after the entry hereof, but shall be effective and enforceable immediately upon entry, and the fourteen (14) day stay provided in such rules is hereby expressly waived and shall not apply. Accordingly, the Debtors are authorized and empowered to close the Sale Transaction immediately upon entry of this Order. Any party objecting to this Order must exercise due diligence in filing an appeal and pursuing a stay within the time prescribed by law and prior to the Closing, or risk its appeal will be foreclosed as moot.

  



  

51. In the event that the Purchaser fails to consummate the Sale Transaction, the Backup Bidder will be deemed to have the new prevailing bid, and the Debtors will be authorized, without further order of this Court, to consummate the Sale Transaction with the Backup Bidder as the Purchaser (as such term is used throughout this Order).

  



  

52. This Court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction to enforce and implement the terms and provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, all amendments thereto, any waivers and consents thereunder, and of each of the agreements executed in connections therewith in all respects, including, but not limited to, retaining jurisdiction to (a) compel delivery of the Donlen Assets to the Purchaser free and clear of Interests, or compel the performance of other obligations owed by the Debtors, (b) compel delivery of the purchase price or performance of other obligations owed to the Debtors, (c) resolve any disputes arising under or related to the Asset Purchase Agreement, except as otherwise provided therein, (d) interpret, implement, and enforce the provisions of this Order, and (e) protect the Purchaser and Purchaser Parties against (i) claims made related to any of the Excluded Liabilities, (ii) any claims of successor or vicarious liability related to the Donlen Assets or Assigned Contracts, or (iii) any Interests asserted in, on, or against the Debtors or the Donlen Assets, of any kind or nature whatsoever.

  



  

   

 | 31|

53. To the extent the Debtors receive, hold, or otherwise come into possession of any payment or asset that constitutes Donlen Assets after the Closing, the Debtors shall promptly deliver or otherwise turn over such payment or asset to the Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

  



  

54. The Debtors are authorized to take all actions necessary to effectuate the relief granted pursuant to this Order in accordance with the Motion.

calculation._

  



  

 _ _Note 3__ _: All cash is initially received to unrestricted cash via a
lockbox. Management subsequently identifies which cash amounts are associated
with ABS vehicles/leases and transfers the cash to restricted cash. This
amount represents restricted cash in-transit (received in unrestricted cash
but not yet reclassified to restricted cash) associated with bank accounts [_
_● ] (JPMorgan Chase, US), [●] (JPMorgan Chase, US), and [●] (Bank of
Montreal, CAD), the three unrestricted cash bank accounts where restricted
cash in-transit is initially received. All cash (unrestricted or restricted
cash in-transit) associated with the two aforementioned bank accounts will be
left with the buyer. The amount of restricted cash in-transit associated with
this line item will be identified during the 45 day closing calculations true
up period and will cover the Vehicle sales suspended account ([●]) at a
minimum, as all amounts associated with this account sits in unrestricted cash
pending the bill of sale and reclassification to restricted cash. _

 _ _Note 4:_ For the avoidance of doubt, vehicle debt (third party) will not
include any prepaid or unamortized capitalized debt issuance costs._

 _**Note: Any new current asset or current liability accounts created after
this illustration date shall be included in this closing calculation. For the
closing calculation, the measurement of NWC shall be applied in a consistent
manner with how the Company has historically recorded such assets and
liabilities in its short-term and long-term classification (in a manner
consistent with this schedule), regardless of GAAP application. Any potential
standalone accruals will not be reported for closing calculation purposes._
