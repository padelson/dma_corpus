executed by Purchaser.

The parties agree that Purchaser shall be deemed to have satisfied its
obligations under clause "(i)," "(ii)," "(iii)" and "(vi)" of the immediately
preceding sentence if Purchaser delivers to the Sellers Agent evidence of a
federal funds wire number evidencing the wire transfers referred to in such
clauses (and such wire transfers are ultimately received by the intended
recipients as described in such clauses). All payments and other actions under
this Section 1.3, and all documents to be executed and delivered by the
parties pursuant to this Section 1.3, shall be deemed to have been made,
taken, executed and delivered simultaneously.

1.4 Determination of Actual Net Working Capital. Within 60 calendar days
after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers
Agent a draft Net Working Capital Statement in substantially the form of
_Schedule 1.4_ , signed by Purchaser, identifying Purchasers calculation of
the Net Working Capital Amount and any adjustments to the purchase price
payable for the Shares as a result of the Net Working Capital Amount being
greater or less than the Target Net Working Capital Amount. If the Sellers
Agent does not object to Purchasers draft Net Working Capital Statement
within 30 calendar days after receipt thereof, or accepts such draft Net
Working Capital Statement during such 30-day period, the purchase price
payable for the Shares shall be adjusted as set forth in Purchasers draft
Net Working Capital Statement, and payment made in accordance with Section
1.5. If the Sellers Agent objects to Purchasers draft Net Working Capital
Statement, the Sellers Agent shall notify Purchaser in writing of such
objection within 30 calendar days after the Sellers Agents

 



5  receipt thereof (such notice setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for such objection). During such 30-day period (the " _NWC Review Period_ "),
subject to the execution by the Sellers Agent of a confidentiality agreement
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser (the " _NWC Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
Purchaser shall permit the Sellers Agent access to such work papers relating
to the preparation of Purchasers draft Net Working Capital Statement as may
be reasonably necessary to permit the Sellers Agent to review the manner in
which Purchasers draft Net Working Capital Statement was prepared (such
papers, the " _NWC Papers_ " and such review, the " _NWC Review_ "). Without
limitation of the foregoing, the Sellers Agent may, at its expense, engage an
independent accountant (the " _Sellers  Agents NWC Accountant_") to assist
the Sellers Agent in conducting the NWC Review, and, subject to the execution
by the Sellers Agents NWC Accountant of the NWC Confidentiality Agreement,
Purchaser shall, during the NWC Review Period, permit the Sellers Agents
NWC Accountant access to the NWC Papers for the sole purpose of assisting the
Sellers Agent in conducting the NWC Review. During the NWC Review Period,
Purchaser shall permit the Sellers Agent and the Sellers Agents NWC
Accountant to consult with the employees of the Company or Purchaser who
prepared the draft Net Working Capital Statement to the extent reasonably
necessary to interpret the NWC Papers pursuant to the NWC Review. Purchaser
and the Sellers Agent shall thereafter negotiate in good faith to resolve any
such objections. If Purchaser and the Sellers Agent are unable to resolve all
of such objections within 10 calendar days following the end of the

or determined in accordance with Section 1.4 (the " _Actual Net Working
Capital Amount_ ") shall be used to calculate post-Closing adjustments to the
purchase price payable for the Shares. Within two business days after the date
on which the Actual Net Working Capital Amount is agreed or determined in
accordance with Section 1.4, either: (a) if the Actual Net Working Capital
Amount _exceeds_ the Target Net Working Capital Amount by the amount set forth
on _Schedule 1.5_ (such amount set forth on _Schedule 1.5_ , the " _Allowance_
") or more, then Purchaser shall pay (or shall cause to be paid) to the
account of the Sellers Solicitors (who are irrevocably authorized to receive
the same), for the benefit of (and for distribution by the Sellers Solicitors
to) the Sellers and the Cash Cancel Sellers, by wire transfer of same day
available funds, an amount equal to the amount by which the Actual Net Working
Capital Amount (disregarding the Allowance) _exceeds_ the Target Net Working
Capital Amount; or (b) if the Target Net Working Capital Amount _exceeds_ the
Actual Net Working Capital Amount by the Allowance or more (the amount, if
any, by which the Target Net Working Capital Amount (disregarding the
Allowance) _exceeds_ the Actual Net Working Capital Amount being referred to
as the " _Net Working Capital Shortfall_ "), then the Sellers and the Cash
Cancel Sellers agree that the Sellers Agent shall provide written
instructions to the Escrow Agent and Purchaser, within three business days
after the date on which the Actual Net Working Capital Amount is agreed or
determined, authorizing the withdrawal from the General Escrow Account of an
amount equal to the Net Working Capital Shortfall. For the avoidance
of doubt, if the difference between the Actual Net Working Capital Amount and
the Target Net Working Capital Amount is less than the Allowance, no payment
shall be due under this Section 1.5.

in such Initial Objection Notice or Final Objection Notice, as the case may
be, is resolved.

(c) _Deduction of Earn-Out Consideration Fees_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 1.6(c) or elsewhere in this Agreement
(and without limiting any other rights or remedies available to Purchaser),
Purchaser shall, subsequent to the rendering of a final determination

as the case may be, Loan Notes) equal to the Sellers portion of the Earn-Out
Consideration Fees (as defined below) but only to the extent that the Sellers
portion of such Earn-Out Consideration Fees remain outstanding.

following the end of the One Year Period, Purchaser shall: (i) prepare or
cause to be prepared a statement (the " _One Year Bookings Statement_ ")
setting forth the One Year Bookings, together with the amounts of any Earn-Out
Consideration that Purchaser believes is due in accordance with this Section
1.6; and (ii) deliver or cause to be delivered such One Year Bookings
Statement to the Sellers Agent for and on behalf of the Sellers.

 

(e) _Dispute Resolution_. In the event that the Sellers Agent objects to
Purchasers calculation in the One Year Bookings Statement or the amount of
any Earn-Out Consideration set forth in the One Year Bookings Statement or
requires further information in order to perform such calculations or
determine such amounts, then, within 20 calendar days after the delivery to
the Sellers Agent of such One Year Bookings Statement (the " _Initial
Response Period_ "), the Sellers Agent shall deliver to Purchaser a written
notice (an " _Initial Objection Notice_ "): (i) describing in reasonable
detail the Sellers Agents objections to Purchasers calculation of the
amounts set forth in such statement and containing, to the extent possible, a
statement setting forth the One Year Bookings or the amount of any such Earn-
Out Consideration determined by the Sellers Agent to be correct; or (ii)
requesting additional information from Purchaser that the Sellers Agent deems
reasonably necessary in order to perform such calculations or determine such
amounts (which information, to the extent reasonably necessary in order to
perform such calculations, shall be provided by Purchaser within 15

 



9  calendar days after Purchasers receipt of such request). If the Sellers
Agent does not deliver an Initial Objection Notice to Purchaser during the
Initial Response Period, then Purchasers calculation of the amounts set
forth in the One Year Bookings Statement shall be binding and conclusive on
Purchaser, the Sellers and the Sellers Agent. If the Sellers Agent delivers
an Initial Objection Notice to Purchaser accompanied by a request for
additional information from Purchaser as described above during the Initial
Response Period, then the Sellers Agent shall have an additional 20 calendar
days after receiving from Purchaser either: (x) all of the information
requested by the Sellers Agent; or (y) written notice from Purchaser that no
further requested information is to be provided (such 20 calendar day period,
the " _Final Response Period_ ") to deliver to Purchaser a written notice (a
" _Final Objection Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the Sellers
Agents objections to Purchasers calculations of the amounts set forth in
such One Year Bookings Statement accompanied by a statement, to the extent
possible, setting forth the One Year Bookings or the amount of any such Earn-
Out Consideration determined by the Sellers Agent to be correct. If the
Sellers Agent has requested additional information in an Initial Objection
Notice delivered during the Initial Response Period and does not deliver a
Final Objection Notice to Purchaser during the Final Response Period, then
Purchasers calculation of the amounts set forth in the One Year Bookings
Statement shall be binding and conclusive on Purchaser, the Sellers and the
Sellers Agent. If the Sellers Agent delivers an Initial Objection Notice or
Final Objection Notice, as the case may be, accompanied by a statement, to
the extent possible, setting forth the One Year Bookings or the amount of any
such Earn-Out Consideration determined by the Sellers Agent to be correct to
Purchaser during either the Initial Response Period or the Final Response
Period in accordance with this Section 1.6(e), and if the Sellers Agent and
Purchaser are unable to agree upon the calculation of the amounts set forth in
the One Year Bookings Statement within 30 days after such Initial Objection
Notice or Final Objection Notice, as the case may be, is delivered to
Purchaser, the dispute shall be finally settled by such independent firm of
chartered accountants as is agreed between the Sellers Agent and Purchaser,
or, should they fail to reach such agreement within 10 calendar days, the
matters in dispute shall be referred to such independent firm of chartered
accountants as is appointed, on the application of the Sellers Agent or
Purchaser, by the President for the time being of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales (the firm so appointed being referred to as
the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "). The Independent Accounting Firm shall
act on the basis set out on _Schedule 1.6(e)_. The determination by the
Independent Accounting Firm of the disputed amounts and the Earn-Out
Consideration, if any, shall be conclusive and binding on Purchaser, the
Sellers and the Sellers Agent (in the absence of manifest error). Purchaser
and the Sellers Agent (on behalf of the Sellers) shall each bear and pay 50%
of the fees and other expenses of such Independent Accounting Firm or
otherwise as the Independent Accounting Firm shall determine (the " _Earn-Out
Consideration Fees_ ").

(f) _No Assignment_. No rights or interest of any Seller under this Section
1.6 may be assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, in whole or in
part, other than pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution or by will
or otherwise with the prior written consent of Purchaser.

 

(g) _Examination of Books_. At reasonable times during normal business hours
and upon reasonable notice provided to Purchaser, Purchaser shall permit the
Sellers Agent, to examine the financial books and records of the Company
and/or Purchaser, only to the extent necessary for the exercise of the
Sellers Agents right to object to Purchasers calculation of the amounts
set forth in the One Year Bookings Statement. The Sellers Agent agrees that
he shall hold all information acquired during such examination in strict
confidence and shall use such information only for purposes of making
calculations under this Section 1.6; _provided, however_ , that such
information may be provided to agents and independent contractors of the
Sellers Agent that are subject to contractual (or, with respect to counsel,
professional) confidentiality obligations in favor of (and for the benefit of)
Purchaser in respect of such information for use in furtherance of an
engagement to assist the Sellers Agent in making such calculations as
provided for herein.

 



10 (h) _Efforts_. While Purchaser currently believes that it is in its
best interest that it and the Acquired Companies use commercially reasonable
efforts to generate One Year Bookings, it is understood and agreed that: (i)
neither Purchaser nor any Acquired Company has any obligation to use any
specified efforts to generate One Year Bookings (or to sell or license
Specified Company Products or develop, sell or license any future releases of
the Specified Company Products; and (ii) Purchaser (on behalf of itself and on
behalf of any of its Subsidiaries, including any Acquired Company) may
discontinue the sale or license of Specified Company Products and the sale,
license or development of any future releases of the Specified Company
Products at any time without penalty (it being understood, however, that
Purchaser will act in good faith in connection with the foregoing).

1.7 Withholding. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from: (a)
the Earn-out Consideration payable (in cash or by the issuance of Loan Notes)
pursuant to this Agreement and any interest payable to the Sellers pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement after the Closing all amounts required to be deducted
and/or withheld strictly in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements; and
(b) any amount payable under this Agreement at the Closing to any Seller who
is a United States person and who has not, prior to the Closing, delivered to
Purchaser a properly completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form
W-9 certifying that such Seller is a United States person all amounts required
to be deducted and/or withheld in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and
subsequently paid to the appropriate Tax authority by Purchaser, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

sufficient and accurate records, invoices and other information in relation to

computing the income of an Acquired Company for the purposes of any Taxes on
income or profits to which an Acquired Company may be subject.

the profits of the Acquired Company for Taxation purposes.

(p) _Disguised remuneration_. The Disclosure Schedule contains details of any
benefits in kind paid, made available or earmarked, however informally, for
the benefit of any employee or former employee (or any associate of such

on a disposal of any of its assets (other than trading stock) at the carrying

consideration actually given for it on its acquisition (if such asset was

30  being made for Taxation purposes, and no notice or inquiry has been made by
any Tax Authority in connection with any such transactions or arrangements.

 

(t) _Tax avoidance_. No Acquired Company has been a party to, nor otherwise
involved in, any transaction, scheme or arrangement designed wholly or
mainly, or containing steps or stages having no commercial purpose and

dispute or other condition or circumstance exists, that is substantially
likely to give rise to or serve as the basis for such a Legal Proceeding.

5\. INDEMNIFICATION, ETC.

5.1 Survival of Representations, Etc.

(a) _General Survival_. Subject to Section 5.1(b) and Section 5.1(d), the
representations and warranties made by the Designated Sellers and the other
Sellers in this Agreement and the representations and warranties set forth in
the Closing Consideration Certificate, in each case other than the Specified
Representations, shall survive the Closing Date and shall expire on the date
that is 450 days after the Closing Date (the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided, however,_ that if, at any time prior to the Termination
Date, Purchaser (acting in good faith) delivers to the Sellers Agent a
written notice alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any
of such representations and warranties and asserting a claim for recovery
under Section 5.2 based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the claim
asserted in such notice shall survive the Termination Date until such time as
such claim is fully and finally resolved.

 

(b) _Specified Representations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 5.1(a), but subject to Section 5.1(d), the Specified
Representations shall survive as follows:

(i) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2 shall survive
until the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable thereto
(including any extensions thereof);

 



42 (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.15 shall
survive until the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date; and

 

(iii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.3, Section
3.10 and Section 3.13 shall survive the Closing Date and shall expire on the
date that is 690 days after the Closing Date; _provided, however,_ that if, at
any time prior to the 690th day after the Closing Date, Purchaser (acting in
good faith) delivers to the Sellers Agent a written notice alleging the
existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of such representations and
warranties and asserting a claim for recovery under Section 5.2 based on such
alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such notice
shall survive the expiration date set forth in this clause "(iii)" until such
time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

(c) _Guarantor and Purchaser Representations_. All representations and
warranties made by Guarantor and Purchaser in this Agreement shall survive
until the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable thereto
(including any extension thereof).

(d) _Intentional Misrepresentation; Fraud_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 5.1(a) or Section 5.1(b), the limitations set
forth in Section 5.1(a) and 5.1(b) shall not apply in the case of claims based
upon intentional misrepresentation or fraud. A Seller shall have no liability
in respect of the intentional misrepresentation or fraud of any other Seller.
For the purposes of this Section 5, the term "fraud" is intended to encompass
circumstances involving a misrepresentation made knowingly or intentionally,
rather than mere negligence or gross negligence.

(e) _Representations Not Limited_. The representations, warranties, covenants
and obligations of the Sellers and Purchaser, and the rights and remedies that
may be exercised by Purchaser, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by
or as a result of any information furnished to, or any investigation made by
or knowledge of, any of Purchaser or any of its Representatives. Without
limiting the foregoing, nothing disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule shall
limit or otherwise adversely affect any rights or remedies available to
Purchaser under the Tax Covenant.

(f) _No Other Representations_. Without limitation of any of Purchasers
rights with respect to claims based upon intentional misrepresentation or
fraud, the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2 and 3,
together with any representations and warranties contained in any agreement,
document or instrument contemplated by this Agreement, are the only
representations and warranties made by the Sellers (including the Designated
Sellers) with respect to the Acquired Companies.

 

5.2 Indemnification.

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Closing Date (but subject to Section
5.1), each Seller: (x) severally with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2; and (y) severally and pro rata (based upon
such Sellers Participation Percentage) with respect to the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3 and with respect to the other matters
contemplated by this Section 5.2, shall hold harmless and indemnify Purchaser
from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse Purchaser for, any
Damages which are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by Purchaser or
to which Purchaser may otherwise directly or indirectly become subject
(regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third party claim)
and which arise directly or indirectly from or as a result of, or are directly
or indirectly connected with:

 

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made in
Section 2 or Section 3 as if such representation or warranty was made on and
as of the

 



43  Closing (without giving effect to any materiality or similar qualification
limiting the scope of any Designated Representation);

 

(ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty set forth
in the Closing Consideration Certificate;

(iii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Sellers in this
Agreement; 

(iv) any matter referred to in Part 3.16(p) or 3.16(r) of the Disclosure
Schedule, including any claim or Legal Proceeding resulting therefrom or
relating thereto; and

(v) any Legal Proceeding relating to any breach or any other matter of the
type referred to in clause "(i)," "(ii)," "(iii)" or "(iv)" above (including
any Legal Proceeding commenced by Purchaser for the purpose of enforcing any
of its rights under this Section 5).

(b) _Damage to Purchaser_. The parties acknowledge and agree that, if, on or
after the Closing Date, any of the Acquired Companies suffers, incurs or
otherwise becomes subject to any Damages as a result of or in connection with
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation or any other matter referred to in Section 5.2(a), then Purchaser
shall also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Company,
to have incurred Damages as a result of and in connection with such
inaccuracy, breach or matter.

 

5.3 Limitations.

(a) _Basket_. Subject to Section 5.3(b), the Sellers shall not be required to
make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(i) for any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement:
(i) unless the amount of Damages that have been directly or indirectly
suffered or incurred by Purchaser, or to which Purchaser has otherwise
directly or indirectly become subject, arising out of any individual
inaccuracy or breach (or multiple inaccuracies or breaches of the same
representation or warranty or of different representations and warranties, but
based on similar events, conditions, facts or circumstances) (without giving
effect to any materiality or similar qualification limiting the scope of any
Designated Representation) exceeds $10,000 (a " _Qualifying Claim_ "); and
(ii) until such time as the total amount of Damages from all Qualifying Claims
exceeds $200,000 in the aggregate. If the total amount of such Damages from
all Qualifying Claims exceeds $200,000 in the aggregate, then Purchaser shall
be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed for the
entire amount of such Damages, and not merely the portion of such Damages
exceeding $200,000.

(b) _Applicability of Basket_. The limitations set forth in Section 5.3(a)
shall not apply: (i) in the case of intentional misrepresentation or fraud;
(ii) to inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the Specified Representations
(except for the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.10 and
Section 3.13); (iii) to inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.5(d); (iv) to the
matters referred to in Sections 5.2(a)(ii), 5.2(a)(iii) and 5.2(a)(iv); or
(v) to the matters referred to in Section 5.2(a)(v) (to the extent related to
any of the matters referred to in clauses "(i)" through "(iv)" of this
sentence).

 

(c) _Recourse_. Subject to Section 5.3(d), recourse by Purchaser to the
General Escrow Amount ( _plus_ any interest or earnings thereon) shall be
Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy for monetary Damages resulting from the
matters referred to in Section 5.2.

 



44 (d) _Applicability of Liability Cap_.

 

(i) The limitations set forth in Section 5.3(c) shall not apply: (A) in the
case of intentional misrepresentation or fraud; (B) to inaccuracies in or
breaches of any of the Specified Representations; (C) to the matters referred
to in Sections 5.2(a)(ii), 5.2(a)(iii) and 5.2(a)(iv); or (D) to the matters
referred to in Section 5.2(a)(v) (to the extent related to any of the matters
referred to in clauses "(A)" through "(C)" of this sentence).

(ii) Except in the case of intentional misrepresentation or fraud, the total
amount of indemnification payments that the Sellers can be required to make to
Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.2 shall be limited to:

(A) with respect to: (1) inaccuracies in or breaches of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 2; and (2) any breach by
any Seller of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the
amounts described in clause "(ii)(A)" of _Schedule 5.3(d)(ii)(A)_ ;

 

(B) with respect to inaccuracies in or breaches of the Specified
Representations (other than the representations and warranties contained in

(C) with respect to the matters referred to in Section 5.2(a)(iv), the amounts
described in clause "(ii)(C)" of _Schedule 5.3(d)(ii)(C)_.

5.4 Notice. The Sellers shall not be required to make any indemnification
payment pursuant to Section 5.2 unless:

(a) Purchaser delivers to the Sellers Agent a written notice alleging (in
reasonable detail) the basis for indemnification pursuant to Section 5.2: (i)
with respect to indemnification for an inaccuracy in or breach of a
representation or warranty, not later than the expiry of the relevant
representation or warranty (as set forth in Sections 5.1(a) or 5.1(b)); and
(ii) with respect to indemnification for the matters referred to in Sections
5.2(a)(ii), 5.2(a)(iii), 5.2(a)(iv) and 5.2(a)(v) (to the extent related to
any of the matters referred to in Sections 5.2(a)(ii), 5.2(a)(iii) or
5.2(a)(iv)), the applicable statute of limitations; and

 

(b) with respect to a particular claim for indemnification (other than a claim
pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(iv), with respect to which this Section 5.4(b)
shall not apply), Purchaser commences a procedure in accordance with Section
6.10(c) within 12 months of the earlier of: (i) the date Purchaser actually
delivers the written notice described in Section 5.4(a) with respect to such
claim; and (ii) the latest time Purchaser is permitted to deliver such notice
with respect to such claim in order to satisfy the condition set forth in
Section 5.4(a) (it being understood that the commencement of an arbitration
procedure in accordance with Section 6.10(c) shall be sufficient to satisfy
the condition set forth in this Section 5.4(b) even if the relevant arbitrator
determines not to resolve the relevant dispute until a third party claim is
resolved, or otherwise).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a)
or Section 5.4(b), this Section 5.4 shall not apply to any claim for
intentional misrepresentation or fraud.

5.5 No Double Recovery. Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover Damages or
otherwise obtain reimbursement or restitution more than once in respect of the
same loss.

 



45 5.6 No Contribution. Each Seller waives, and acknowledges and agrees that he
shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or
assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or
remedy against any of the Acquired Companies in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which he may become
subject under or in connection with this Agreement or any other agreement or
document delivered to Purchaser in connection with this Agreement.

 

5.7 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
any of the Acquired Companies, Purchaser or any other Person) with respect to
which any Seller (including any Designated Seller) may become obligated to
hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse Purchaser pursuant
to Section 5 (other than a claim or Legal Proceeding under the Tax Covenant
or a claim or Legal Proceeding under this Agreement in respect of any Tax-
related matter (with respect to which clause 4 of the Tax Covenant shall apply
instead)), Purchaser shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with
the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Sellers Agent. If Purchaser so proceeds with
the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

(a) each Seller shall make available to Purchaser any documents and materials
in his possession or control that may be necessary to the defense of such
claim or Legal Proceeding;

(b) Purchaser shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim
or Legal Proceeding; _provided, however,_ that: (i) before finally settling,
adjusting or compromising such claim or Legal Proceeding, Purchaser shall
consult with the Sellers Agent by informing the Sellers Agent of the terms
of such settlement, adjustment or compromise and soliciting the Sellers
Agents opinion thereon; and (ii) if Purchaser settles, adjusts or compromises
any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the Sellers Agent,
such settlement, adjustment or compromise shall not be conclusive evidence of
the amount of Damages incurred by Purchaser in connection with such claim or
Legal Proceeding (it being understood that if Purchaser requests that the
Sellers Agent consent to a settlement, adjustment or compromise, the Sellers
Agent shall not unreasonably withhold or delay such consent); and

 

(c) Purchaser shall reasonably provide the Sellers Agent with oral or written
updates concerning material developments in the defense of such claim or
Legal Proceeding.

Purchaser shall give the Sellers Agent prompt written notice of
the commencement of any such claim or Legal Proceeding against Purchaser or
any Acquired Company; _provided, however_ , that any failure on the part of
Purchaser to so notify the Sellers Agent shall not limit any of the
obligations of the Sellers under Section 5 (except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding). If Purchaser does
not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding,
the Sellers Agent may proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser; _provided,
however,_ that the Sellers Agent may not settle, adjust or compromise any
such claim or Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent of Purchaser
(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

5.8 Setoff. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5, Purchaser
shall have the right to withhold and deduct any sum that may be owed to
Purchaser under this Agreement from any amount otherwise payable by Purchaser
to any Seller in respect of shares of Company Capital Stock that were owned
by such Seller; _provided, however,_ that Purchaser shall not be entitled to
seek recovery of any indemnification claim pursuant to the setoff rights
described in this Section 5.8 after the date on which Purchaser shall have
actually made all payments required to be made under Section 1.6.

 



46 5.9 Order of Recourse. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement:

(a) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Section 5.9, the following terms shall
have the following meanings:

(i) " _Amount Claimed_ " shall mean the aggregate amount of Damages (for the
avoidance of doubt, including any Possibly Uninsured Damages) that Purchaser
claims to be owing under Section 5.2 at any relevant time; _provided,
however,_ that the aggregate amount of Damages (for the avoidance of
doubt, including any Possibly Uninsured Damages) that Purchaser claims to be
owing under Section 5.2(a)(iv) shall only be included in the Amount Claimed to
the extent that such Damages _exceed_ the portion of the Special Escrow Amount
remaining in the Special Escrow Account.

(ii) " _Available Recourse Funds_ " shall mean: (A) any portion of the
General Escrow Amount that remains in the General Escrow Account and is not
subject to pending claims at the time a claim is made under Section 5.2;

coverage for the particular matter at issue; (2) remains available under the
RandW Insurance Policy; and (3) is not subject to pending claims at the time a

take a position on or has delivered or caused to be delivered, or, based on
Purchasers reasonable determination after consultation with the RandW Claims
Advisor, is expected to deliver or cause to be delivered, a written notice
either: (1) denying that such Damages are covered by the RandW Insurance
Policy; or (2) declining to accept or deny that (or reserving rights with
respect to whether) such Damages are covered by the RandW Insurance Policy;
_provided, however,_ that such Damages shall cease to be Possibly Uninsured
Damages upon the earlier of: (x) Purchaser reasonably determining, after
consultation with the RandW Claims Advisor, that the RandW Insurer is likely to

the RandW Insurance Policy.

Section 5.2 (other than an indemnification claim under (x) Section 5.2(a)(i)
related to an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made
in Section 2; or (y) Section 5.2(a)(iv)), Purchaser shall: (A) pursue such
claim against the General Escrow Account prior to pursuing such claim against
the RandW Insurance Policy; and (B) pursue such claim against the General Escrow
Account and the RandW Insurance Policy (to the extent that the matter at issue
is within the scope of the coverage provided by the RandW Insurance Policy)
prior to pursuing such claim through its setoff rights under Section 5.8 or
directly against any Seller;

 

(ii) if Purchaser has (or claims to have) an indemnification claim under
Section 5.2(a)(i) related to an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation

and absolute discretion): (A) against the RandW

 



47  Insurance Policy; (B) through its setoff rights under Section 5.8; or (C)
directly against the relevant Seller; and

 

(iii) if Purchaser has (or claims to have) an indemnification claim
under Section 5.2(a)(iv), Purchaser shall: (A) if such claim is being made on
or before the 365th day after the Closing Date, pursue such claim against the
Special Escrow Account prior to pursuing such claim against the General Escrow
Account; and (B) pursue such claim against the General Escrow Account prior
to pursuing such claim through its setoff rights under Section 5.8.

(c) _Applicability of Order of Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 5.9(b):

(iii) if the Amount Claimed _exceeds_ the General Escrow Amount (and the
Amount Claimed includes Possibly Uninsured Damages), Purchaser shall be
entitled to exercise the setoff rights provided by Section 5.8 with respect to
any Possibly Uninsured Damages (it being understood that if Purchaser
exercises its setoff rights with respect to any Possibly Uninsured Damages and
such Possibly Uninsured Damages cease to be Possibly Uninsured Damages, then
any amounts with respect to which such setoff rights were so exercised shall
promptly be paid in accordance with Section 1.6).

5.10 Insurance Efforts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 5.8, Section 5.9 or elsewhere in this Agreement: (a) Purchaser shall
have no obligation to, and Purchasers rights to indemnification, compensation
and reimbursement pursuant to Section 5.2 shall not be limited by any failure
to, threaten or commence any Legal Proceedings against the RandW Insurer for
coverage under the RandW Insurance Policy; and (b) Purchaser shall have
no obligation to, and Purchasers rights to indemnification, compensation and
reimbursement pursuant to Section 5.2 shall not be limited by any failure to,
seek recovery from the RandW Insurance Policy with respect to any Possibly
Uninsured Damages.

5.11 Tax Covenant. The Sellers and Purchaser agree to the terms contained in
the Tax Covenant. 

5.12 Instructions to the Escrow Agent.

 

(a) _Instructions after One Year_. Within five business days after the one
year anniversary of the Closing, Purchaser and the Sellers Agent shall
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint instructions instructing the
Escrow Agent to release any Special Escrow Cash (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement) that then remains in the Special Escrow Account (the " _Remaining
Special Escrow Cash_ ") to the Sellers Agent on behalf of (and for
distribution by the Sellers Agent to) the Sellers; _provided, however_ , that
if prior to such first anniversary, Purchaser has given one or more Claim
Notices to the Sellers Agent containing one or more claims against the
Special Escrow Cash that have not been resolved prior to such anniversary,
then such joint instructions shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release to
the Sellers Agent on behalf of (and for distribution by the Sellers Agent
to) the Sellers, an amount

 



48  equal to the Remaining Special Escrow Cash _minus_ the Claimed Amount or
Contested Amount, as the case may be, with respect to all claims against the
Special Escrow Cash which have not then been resolved (it being understood
that promptly following resolution of any such claims, Purchaser and the
Sellers Agent shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent additional joint
instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to release the portion of the
Remaining Special Escrow Cash related to such claims in accordance with such
resolution).

(b)  _Instructions after 690 Days_. Within five business days after the 690th
day following the Closing (the " _Final Release Date_ "), Purchaser and the
Sellers Agent shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent
joint instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to release any General Escrow
Cash (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) that then remains in the General
Escrow Account (the " _Remaining General Escrow Cash_ ") to the Sellers Agent
on behalf of (and for distribution by the Sellers Agent to) the Sellers;
_provided, however_ , that if prior to the Final Release Date, Purchaser has
given one or more Claim Notices to the Sellers Agent (or to any particular
Seller) containing one or more claims against the General Escrow Cash that
have not been resolved prior to the Final Release Date, then such joint
instructions shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release to the Sellers Agent
on behalf of (and for distribution by the Sellers Agent to) the Sellers, an
amount equal to the Remaining General Escrow Cash _minus_ the Claimed Amount
or Contested Amount, as the case may be, with respect to all claims against
the General Escrow Cash which have not then been resolved (it being
understood that promptly following resolution of any such claims, Purchaser
and the Sellers Agent shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent
additional joint instructions instructing the Escrow Agent to release the
portion of the Remaining General Escrow Cash related to such claims in
accordance with such resolution).

(c)  _Failure to Deliver Joint Instructions_. In the event that the Sellers
Agent executes and delivers to the Escrow Agent joint instructions (executed
by the Sellers Agent only) in accordance with Sections 5.12(a) and
5.12(b) within the time periods specified within those Sections, the Sellers
Agent provides such instructions to Purchaser within 24 hours before the last
date that is within such time periods, and Purchaser does not execute and
deliver such instructions within such time periods, then: (i) Purchaser shall
be deemed to have given its consent to the release to the Sellers Agent on
behalf of (and for distribution by the Sellers Agent to) the Sellers, an
amount equal to the Remaining Special Escrow Cash or Remaining General Escrow
Cash, as the case may be, _minus_ the Claimed Amount or Contested Amount, as
the case may be (if any) (in each case, the " _Release Amount_ "); and (ii)
the Sellers Agent may cause the Escrow Agent to release the Release Amount
on presentation of an instruction signed by the Sellers Agent together with a
certificate duly executed by the Sellers Agent, detailing the Release Amount
and confirming that there are no outstanding Claimed Amounts or Contested
Amounts that Purchaser and the Sellers Agent would otherwise be required by
the terms of this Agreement to instruct the Escrow Agent to deduct from the
Release Amount.

expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to the jurisdiction of each

Proceeding commenced in any state or federal court located in the County of
San Francisco, State of California, any claim that such party is not subject
personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that such Legal Proceeding has
been brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such proceeding is

limiting any portion of Section 6.10(b): (i) at the option of Purchaser, any

Proceeding.

6.13 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have waived
any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or
remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right,
privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly
executed and delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not

shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any
extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision
to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to
be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or
otherwise affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law. 

6.17 Parties in Interest. Except for the provisions of Section 5, none of the
provisions of this Agreement is intended to provide any rights or remedies to
any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns (if any).

similar form of protection prior to the disclosure by the Seller of such
information.

as becoming due and payable by Regulations 4 and 5 of the Instalment
Regulations on the assumption that the Corporation Tax payable by the
Acquired Company is the "total liability" of the Acquired Company for that
period within the meaning of the said Regulations 4 and 5 (but nevertheless
despite that assumption treating the Acquired Company as a "large Acquired
Company" (within that meaning) for this purpose if it actually is a "large

any Acquired Company under this _Exhibit B_ or the Agreement is subject to Tax
in the hands of Purchaser or any Acquired Company, then the amount so payable

Tax so charged (or, if no Tax is paid because of the availability of a Relief,
assuming for the purposes of this clause 7.2 that Tax was paid at the Tax

in which case such period shall be 20 Business Days) of receipt of such
request as to whether (where applicable) its consent is given or not (as the
case may be). Failure of any Noteholder to make such notification within the

   4. | _Mechanics of Redemption_ 
---|--- 



   4.1 | Delivery of Certificates 
---|--- 
 

Each Noteholder (or, the personal representatives of a deceased Noteholder or
the trustee in bankruptcy of a bankrupt Noteholder) any part of whose Loan
Notes are due to be redeemed under these Conditions shall deliver up to the
Company, at the address specified pursuant to clause 8 of the Instrument, the
certificate(s) for the Loan Notes which are due to be redeemed in order that
the same may be cancelled and, upon such delivery and against a receipt for
the principal moneys payable in respect of the Loan Notes to be redeemed, the
Company shall pay to the Noteholder the amount payable to him in respect of
such redemption together with all payable interest in respect thereof. If any
such certificate includes Loan Notes which are not at that time to be
redeemed, the Company shall issue to the Noteholder, without charge, a new
certificate for the balance of such Loan Notes.

 



C-15  ---|--- 

If any Noteholder (or, the personal representatives of a deceased Noteholder
or the trustee in bankruptcy of a bankrupt Noteholder), part of whose Loan
Notes are liable to be repaid or redeemed under these Conditions shall fail
or refuse to deliver up the certificate(s) for the same at the time and place
fixed for repayment or redemption, or shall fail or refuse to accept payment
of the moneys payable on redemption or to give a receipt for the same, such
moneys shall be set aside by the Company and paid into a separate bank account
and held by the Company for such Noteholder but without interest, and such
setting aside shall be deemed for all the purposes of these Conditions to be
a payment to such Noteholder and the Company shall then be discharged from
all obligations in connection with such Loan Notes. If the Company shall place
the said monies on deposit at a bank, the Company shall not be responsible for
the safe custody thereon and shall be entitled to withhold a sum on account
of any costs incurred in connection therewith.



   5. | _No withholding etc._ 
---|--- 



   5.1 | No withholding 
---|--- 

All payments to be made by the Company under or in respect of the Loan Notes
shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding of tax
save as required by law.

 



   5.2 | If withholding is required 
---|--- 
 

If the Company is required to make any deduction or withholding of tax from
any payment to a Noteholder the Company shall notify each of the Noteholders
of the amount which it is required to deduct or withhold within a reasonable
period of time.



   5.3 | Payment to relevant authority 
---|--- 

If, as a result of a payment being made by or on behalf of the Company under
the Loan Notes, the Company is required to withhold or pay any tax or amount
in respect of tax, 

 



C-16   the Company shall pay such amount in full to the relevant authority within
the time allowed for such payment under applicable law. The Company shall,
upon written request, deliver to each Noteholder an original (or certified
copy) of a receipt, if any, issued by the relevant authority evidencing that
payment in full has been received by the relevant authority.

 



   5.4 | Double Tax 
---|--- 

If as a result of the provisions of a double taxation treaty between the
country of residence of the Company and the country of residence of the
Noteholder a withholding of tax can be eliminated or reduced, the Company and
the Noteholder shall use reasonable endeavours and take reasonable steps to
avail themselves of the benefit of such relief under the aforementioned
treaty.



   6. | _Modification of rights_ 
---|--- 

The provisions of the Instrument constituting the Loan Notes and the rights of
the Noteholders are subject to modification, abrogation or compromise in any
respect with the sanction of the Noteholders (acting by Noteholder Consent)
as defined in the Instrument and with the consent of the Company.



   7. | _No Listing_ 
---|--- 

No application has been or will be made to any stock exchange or stock market
for the Loan Notes to be listed, dealt in, sold, quoted or traded and the Loan
Notes shall not be capable of being listed, dealt in, sold, quoted or traded
on any stock exchange or stock market (whether in the United States of
America, the United Kingdom or elsewhere).



   8. | _Notices_ 
---|--- 



   8.1 | Service on the Noteholders 
---|--- 
 

Any notice or other document (including a Loan Note certificate) may be given
or sent to any Noteholder by sending the same by registered first class post
(or in the case of a Noteholder whose registered address is outside the United
Kingdom by registered

 



C-17   airmail) or by hand to the registered address of the Noteholder. In the case
of joint registered holders of any Loan Notes, a notice given to the
Noteholder whose name stands first in the Register in respect of such Loan
Notes shall be sufficient notice to all joint holders.



   8.2 | Service in the event of death or bankruptcy 
---|--- 

Notice may be given to the persons entitled to any Loan Notes in consequence
of the death or bankruptcy of any Noteholder upon that person producing to the
Company such evidence as the Company may reasonably require to show his title
to the notices and by the Company sending the notice by the methods set out
above to title of the representative or trustee of such holder to the address
supplied for the purpose by such persons and such service or delivery shall
for all purposes be deemed a sufficient service or delivery of such notice or
document on all persons interested (whether jointly with or as claiming
through or under him) in such Loan Notes. Otherwise, any notice or
document delivered or sent by post to, or left at the address of, any
Noteholder in pursuance of these provisions shall, notwithstanding that such
Noteholder be then dead or bankrupt and whether or not the Company has notice
of his death or bankruptcy, be deemed to have been duly served or delivered
in respect of any Loan Notes registered in the name of such Noteholder as sole
or first-named joint holder.



   8.3 | Service on the Company 
---|--- 
 

Any notice demand or other document required to be given to the Company under
these Conditions or under the Instrument shall be in writing and may be
served either by hand or by sending it by registered air mail to the address
specified pursuant to Clause 7.1 of the Instrument.



   8.4 | Deemed receipt of notice 
---|--- 
 

Any notice, demand or other document sent by first class registered post shall
be deemed to be served or received at the expiration of 48 hours after the
time when it is posted, 5 Business Days after posting if sent by registered
airmail and at the time of delivery if delivered by hand and, in proving such
service or receipt, in the case of a notice sent by post it shall be
sufficient to prove that the envelope containing the notice or document was
properly addressed, stamped and posted (using registered mail).

 



C-18  ---|--- 
 

Words and expressions defined in the Instrument shall have the same respective
meanings in these Conditions.

 



   10. | _Ancillary provisions_ 
---|--- 



   10.1 | No waiver 
---|--- 

No exercise or failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right, power or
remedy vested in any Noteholder shall constitute a waiver by that Noteholder
of that or any other right, power or authority.

 



   10.2 | Unlawful provisions 
---|--- 

If any of these Conditions shall be held to be unlawful, the same shall be
deemed to be deleted, and these Conditions shall remain in full force and
effect as if the deleted provision had never been contained therein.

Notes may be subject. The receipt of the registered holder for the time being
of any Loan Notes or, in the case of joint registered holders, the receipt of
any of them for the interest from time to time accruing due thereon or the
principal amount of the Loan Notes or any other moneys payable in respect of
the same shall be a good discharge to the Company, notwithstanding any notice
it may have, whether express or otherwise, of the right, title, interest or
claim of any other person to or in such Loan Notes, interest or moneys. The
Company shall not be bound to enter notice of any trust, whether express,
implied or constructive, on the Register in respect of any Loan Notes.

---|--- 
 

The executors or administrators of a deceased registered holder of Loan Notes

survivors of such joint registered holders shall be the only person or persons
recognised by the Company as having any title to such Loan Notes.

 



C-20  bankruptcy_

   5.1 | Registration 
---|--- 

Any person becoming entitled to Loan Notes in consequence of the death or
bankruptcy of a holder of Loan Notes or of any other event giving rise to the

   5.2 | Withholding of payments 
---|--- 
 

The Company shall be entitled to withhold payment of all moneys payable in

---|--- 
 

The Company may by notice to the Person Entitled require him to be registered
as the holder of the same, and, in the event of his failure to do so within

   6. | _Payment of moneys_ 
---|--- 

All interest or other moneys payable in cash pursuant to redemption (in
accordance with Condition 3) in respect of the principal and interest on the

registered holder (or in the case of joint registered holders, all of them)
shall have directed by notice to the Company giving at least ten Business
Days before the payment is due to be made of such bank account and such
transfer shall be a good discharge to the Company in respect of the moneys
represented by the same; or  
---|--- 



   (B) |

in default of any such notification, by bankers draft sent through the post
at the risk of the holder or holders to the registered address of the holder,
or in the case of joint 

---|--- 
 



C-21   registered holders to that one of the joint registered holders who is first
named on the Register in respect of such holding, or to such person and at
such address as the registered holder or the joint registered holders shall
have directed by notice to the Company given at least five Business Days
before the payment is due to be made. Every such bankers draft shall be made

moneys represented by the same.



   7. | _Defaced lost or destroyed certificates_ 
---|--- 

If any Loan Note certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced
upon payment by the claimant of the Companys expenses in connection with
replacing it and on such terms (if any) as to evidence, indemnity, security
or otherwise as the Directors may require but so that, in the case of
defacement, the defaced Loan Note certificate shall be surrendered before the
new Loan Note certificate is issued.

 



C-22  SCHEDULE 4

_PROVISIONS FOR MEETINGS OF THE NOTEHOLDERS_



   1. | _Convening of meetings_ 
---|--- 

The Company may at any time, and shall upon the request in writing signed by

Loan Notes for the time being outstanding, convene a meeting of the
Noteholders.

 



   2. | _Notice of meetings_ 
---|--- 

At least 14 days notice exclusive of the day on which notice is served or
deemed to be served and of the day of the meeting for which notice is given,
specifying the place, day and hour of the meeting shall be given to the
Noteholders of any meeting of Noteholders in accordance with the Conditions.
Any such notice shall specify the general nature of the business to be
transacted at the meeting, but, except in the case of a resolution to be
proposed as an Extraordinary Resolution, it shall not be necessary to specify
the terms of any resolution to be proposed. The non-receipt of notice by, or
the accidental omission to give notice to, any Noteholder shall not invalidate
the proceedings at the meeting.

 



   3. | _Attendance of meetings by representatives of the Company_ 
---|--- 

In the case of a meeting convened by the Company, some person nominated by the
Company shall be entitled to take the chair and, in the case of a meeting
convened at the request of the Noteholders, the Noteholders present shall
choose one of their number to be Chairman. The Directors and officers of the
Company and any other person authorised in that behalf by the Directors may
attend at any such meeting.

 



   4. | _Quorum_ 
---|--- 

At any such meeting convened for any purpose other than the passing of an
Extraordinary Resolution at least two persons holding or representing by proxy
one-tenth in nominal amount of the Loan Notes for the time being outstanding
shall form a quorum for the transaction of

 



C-23   business. At any meeting convened for the purpose of passing an
Extraordinary Resolution at least two persons holding or representing by proxy
a majority in nominal amount of the Loan Notes for the time being outstanding
shall form a quorum. No business (other than the choosing of a chairman) shall
be transacted at any meeting unless the requisite quorum is present at the
commencement of business.

 



   5. | _Absence of a quorum_ 
---|--- 

If within 15 minutes from the time appointed for any meeting of the
Noteholders a quorum is not present, the meeting shall, if convened upon the
requisition of the Noteholders, be dissolved. In any other case, it shall
stand adjourned to such day and time (being not less than 14 days after the
adjourned meeting) and to such place as may be appointed by the Chairman and
at such adjourned meeting the Noteholders present in person or by proxy and
entitled to vote, whatever the principal amount of the Loan Notes held by
them, shall form a quorum and shall have power to pass any Extraordinary or
other resolution and to decide upon all matters which could properly have been
disposed of at the meeting from which the adjournment took place.

 



   6. | _Notice of adjourned meeting_ 
---|--- 
 

Notice of any adjourned meeting shall be given in accordance with paragraph 2
and such notice shall state that the Noteholder or Noteholders present
in person or by proxy at the adjourned meeting will form a quorum.



   7. | _Adjournment_ 
---|--- 

The Chairman may with the consent of (and shall if directed by) any such
meeting adjourn the same from time to time and from place to place but no
business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting except business which
might lawfully have been transacted at the meeting from which the adjournment
took place.



   8. | _Declaration by Chairman conclusive unless poll demanded_ 
---|--- 

At any meeting of Noteholders (unless a poll is demanded by the Chairman or by
one or more Noteholders present in person or by proxy and holding or
representing in the aggregate not less than one-twentieth in nominal amount
of the Loan Notes then outstanding) a declaration by the Chairman that a
resolution has been carried, or carried by a particular majority, shall be
conclusive evidence of the fact.

 



C-24  ---|--- 

If at any meeting a poll is demanded as specified in paragraph 8, it shall be
taken in such manner and either at once or after such adjournment as the
Chairman directs and the result of such poll shall be deemed to be the
resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded. No notice need be
given of a poll not taken immediately if the time and date at which it is to
be taken are announced at the meeting at which it is demanded. In any other
case at least seven clear days notice shall be given, specifying the time
and place at which the poll is to be taken. On a poll votes may be given
personally or by proxy and a Noteholder entitled to more than one vote need
not use all his votes or cast them in the same way. The demand for a poll may
be withdrawn but only with the consent of the Chairman. Where a demand is
withdrawn, it will validate the result on a show of hands declared before the
demand was made, or where the poll is demanded before the declaration of the
result on a show of hands, the meeting shall continue as if the demand had
not been made. The demand for a poll (other than on the election of the
Chairman or on the question of adjournment) shall not prevent the continuance
of the meeting for the transaction of business other than that in respect of
which the poll was demanded.



   10. | _Polls on the election of a Chairman_ 
---|--- 
 

Any poll demanded at any such meeting on the election of a Chairman or on any
question of adjournment shall be taken at the meeting without adjournment. 



   11. | _Proxies_ 
---|--- 

The registered holders of any of the Loan Notes or, in the case of joint
holders, any one of them, shall be entitled to vote either in person or by
proxy and in the latter case as if such joint holder was solely entitled to
such Loan Notes. If more than one of such joint holders be present at any
meeting either personally or by proxy, the vote of the senior who tenders a
vote (seniority being determined by the order in which the joint holders are
named in the Register) shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the
other joint holders.

 



C-25  ---|--- 
 

Every instrument appointing a proxy must be in writing signed by the appointor
or his attorney or, in the case of a corporation, under its common seal
or signed by its attorney or authorised representative or otherwise as
permitted by sections 36A or 36B of the Companies Act 1985 and shall be in the
usual or common form or in such other form as the Directors may approve. Such
instrument of proxy shall, unless the same states the contrary upon it, be
valid for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it
relates and need not be witnessed. A proxy need not be a Noteholder. Unless
otherwise provided, an instrument of proxy shall be valid for 12 months from
the date of its execution. The Company may send an instrument of proxy to all
of the persons entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at the meeting.

 



   13. | _Deposit of Proxies_ 
---|--- 

The instrument appointing a proxy and the power of attorney or other
authority (if any) under which it is signed or a notarially certified or
office copy of such power or authority shall be deposited at the address
specified pursuant to clause 8 of the Instrument or at such other address as
may be specified in the notice of meeting or in any form of proxy sent with
such notice not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the
meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in such instrument
proposes to vote and in default the instrument of proxy shall not be treated
as valid. A vote given in accordance with the terms of an instrument
appointing a proxy shall be valid notwithstanding the previous death or
incapacity of the principal or revocation of the instrument of proxy or of
the authority under which the instrument of proxy is given of the Loan Notes
in respect of which it is given unless previous intimation in writing of such
death, incapacity or revocation shall have been received at the address
specified for the delivery of proxies. Deposit of an instrument of proxy by a
Noteholder shall not prevent that Noteholder from attending and voting in
person at the meeting, at any adjourned meeting or on a poll in relation to
any resolution put to the meeting.



   14. | _Corporate Representatives_ 
---|--- 

A body corporate which is a Noteholder may, by resolution of its directors or
other governing body, authorise a person (the "Representative") to act as its
representative at a meeting of the 

 



C-26   Noteholders. The Representative may exercise on behalf of his appointor,
those powers which it could exercise as an individual Noteholder, and the
appointor shall be treated as present in person at a meeting attended by its
Representative.



   15. | _Objections_ 
---|--- 

No objection may be made to the qualification of a voter or to the counting
of a vote except at the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the vote takes
place. An objection properly made shall be referred to the Chairman whose
decision shall be conclusive and binding. The non-qualification of a voter or
an error in the counting of a vote shall not affect the result of the voting
unless, in the opinion of the Chairman, it is of sufficient magnitude to
affect the decision of the meeting.

 



   16. | _Voting rights_ 
---|--- 

On a show of hands each Noteholder who (being an individual) is present in
person or (being a corporation) is present by a representative shall have one
vote and on a poll each Noteholder present in person or by proxy shall have
one vote for every $1 in nominal amount of Loan Notes of which he is the
holder.



   17. | _Powers exercisable by Extraordinary Resolution_ 
---|--- 

A meeting of the Noteholders, in addition to all other powers, may by
Extraordinary Resolution and with the consent of the Company sanction any
modification, abrogation or compromise in any respect of the provisions of
the Instrument or the rights of the Noteholders against the Company, whether
such rights shall arise under the Instrument or otherwise, and in particular
(but without limitation) power to sanction any agreement for postponing
or advancing the time for the payment of the principal moneys or interest
payable in respect of the Loan Notes or for increasing or reducing the rate of
interest on, or for the capitalisation of, the Loan Notes or for the release
of the Company from all or part of its obligations in respect of the Loan
Notes, or a winding up for the purpose of an amalgamation, re-organisation or
reconstruction of the Company.

 



C-27  ---|--- 

An Extraordinary Resolution shall be binding upon all the Noteholders whether
present or not present at such meeting and each of the Noteholders shall be
bound to give effect to such resolution accordingly and the passing of any
such resolution shall be conclusive evidence that the circumstances justify
its passing, the intention being that it shall rest with the meeting to
determine without appeal whether or not the circumstances justify the passing
of such resolution.



   19. | _Resolution in writing_ 
---|--- 

A resolution in writing signed or approved by letter or facsimile, by or on
behalf of the holders of 60 per cent. in principal amount of the Loan Notes
for the time being outstanding who are for the time being entitled to receive
notice of meetings of Noteholders shall for all purposes be as valid and
effective as an Extraordinary Resolution. Such resolution in writing may be
contained in one document or in several documents in like form each signed by
one or more Noteholders. 



   20. | _Minutes_ 
---|--- 

Minutes of all resolutions and proceedings at every such meeting of the
Noteholders shall be made and duly entered in books to be from time to time
provided for that purpose by the Company and any such minutes if purporting to
be signed by the Chairman of the meeting at which such resolutions were
passed or proceedings held or by the Chairman of the next succeeding meeting
of the Noteholders shall be conclusive evidence of the matters contained in
such minutes and until the contrary is proved every such meeting in respect
of the proceedings of which minutes have been made shall be deemed to have
been duly convened and held and all resolutions passed at such a meeting to
have been duly passed.

 



C-28  EXHIBIT D

DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES

Subject to the provisions of Sections 5.3 and 6.10(c) of the Agreement, any
claim for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement pursuant to Section 5
of the Agreement (and, at the option of Purchaser, any other claim for a
monetary remedy, such as in the case of a claim based upon intentional
misrepresentation or fraud, relating to the Agreement after the Closing) shall
be brought and resolved exclusively as follows:

(a) If Purchaser has or claims in good faith to have incurred or suffered
Damages for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under Section 5 of the Agreement or for which it is or may
otherwise be entitled to a monetary remedy relating to the Agreement,
Purchaser may deliver a claim notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the Sellers
Agent. Each Claim Notice shall: (i) state that Purchaser believes in good
faith that Purchaser is entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under Section 5 of the Agreement or is or may otherwise be
entitled to a monetary remedy relating to the Agreement; (ii) contain a
description (in reasonable detail) of the facts and circumstances supporting
Purchasers claim; and (iii) if practicable, contain a non-binding,
preliminary, good faith estimate of the amount to which Purchaser claims to be
entitled (the aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may be modified by
Purchaser in good faith from time to time, being referred to as the " _Claimed
Amount_ ").

(b) During the 20-business day period commencing upon receipt by the Sellers
Agent of a Claim Notice from Purchaser (the " _Dispute Period_ "), the
Sellers Agent may deliver to Purchaser a written response (the " _Response
Notice_ ") in which the Sellers Agent: (i) agrees that the full Claimed
Amount is owed to Purchaser; (ii) agrees that part, but not all, of the
Claimed Amount is owed to Purchaser; or (iii) indicates that no part of the
Claimed Amount is owed to Purchaser. If the Response Notice is delivered in
accordance with clause "(ii)" or "(iii)" of the preceding sentence, the
Response Notice shall also contain a description (in reasonable detail) of
the facts and circumstances supporting the Sellers Agents claim that only a
portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to Purchaser, as the case may
be (any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed to be owed to Purchaser
pursuant to Purchasers Claim Notice being referred to as the " _Contested
Amount_ "). If a Response Notice is not received by Purchaser from the
Sellers Agent prior to the expiration of the Dispute Period, then the
Sellers Agent shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that an amount
equal to the full Claimed Amount is owed to Purchaser.

 

(c) If the Sellers Agent in its Response Notice agrees that the full Claimed
Amount is owed to Purchaser, or if no Response Notice is received by
Purchaser from the Sellers Agent prior to the expiration of the Dispute
Period, the Sellers Agent shall (subject to the order of recourse
contemplated by Section 5.9), within 10 business days following the earlier
of the delivery of such Response Notice or the expiration of the Dispute
Period, cause the Sellers to pay the Claimed Amount to Purchaser.

(d) If the Sellers Agent in the Response Notice agrees that part, but not
all, of the Claimed Amount is owed to Purchaser (the " _Agreed Amount_ "), the
Sellers Agent shall (subject to the order of recourse contemplated by
Section 5.9), within 10 business days following the delivery of such Response
Notice, cause the Sellers to pay the Agreed Amount to Purchaser.

 



D-1  (e) If any Response Notice expressly indicates that there is a Contested
Amount, the Sellers Agent and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to
resolve the dispute related to the Contested Amount. If the Sellers Agent and
Purchaser resolve such dispute, such resolution shall be binding on the
Sellers Agent, the Sellers and Purchaser and a settlement agreement
stipulating the amount owed to Purchaser (the " _Stipulated Amount_ ") shall
be signed by Purchaser and the Sellers Agent. The Sellers Agent shall
(subject to the order of recourse contemplated by Section 5.9), within 10
business days following the execution of such settlement agreement, or such
shorter period of time as may be set forth in the settlement agreement, cause
the Sellers to pay the Stipulated Amount to Purchaser.

(f) In the event that there is a dispute relating to any Claim Notice or
Contested Amount (whether it is a matter between Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Sellers Agent, on the other hand, or it is a matter that is subject
to a claim or Legal Proceeding asserted or commenced by a third party brought
against Purchaser or any Acquired Company in a litigation or arbitration),
such dispute (an " _Arbitrable Dispute_ ") shall be settled by binding
arbitration. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing in this _Exhibit
D_ shall prevent Purchaser from seeking preliminary injunctive relief from a
court of competent jurisdiction pending settlement of any Arbitrable Dispute.

(i) Except as herein specifically stated, any Arbitrable Dispute shall be
resolved by arbitration in San Francisco, California in accordance with JAMS
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the " _JAMS Rules_ ") then
in effect. However, in all events, the provisions contained herein shall
govern over any conflicting rules which may now or hereafter be contained in
the JAMS Rules. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator shall
be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof.
The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any equitable and legal
remedies that would be available if any judicial proceeding was instituted to
resolve an Arbitrable Dispute. The final decision of the arbitrator, as
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, will be furnished by the
arbitrator to the Sellers Agent and Purchaser in writing and will constitute
a final, conclusive and non-appealable determination of the issue in
question, binding upon the Sellers Agent, the Sellers and Purchaser, and an
order with respect thereto may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

 

(ii) Any such arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who
will be compensated for his or her services at a rate to be determined by
Purchaser and the Sellers Agent or by JAMS, but based upon reasonable hourly
or daily consulting rates for the arbitrator in the event the parties are not
able to agree upon his or her rate of compensation. 

(iii) The arbitrator shall be mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the
Sellers Agent. In the event Purchaser and the Sellers Agent are unable to
agree within 20 days following submission of the dispute to JAMS by one of the
parties, JAMS will have the authority to select an arbitrator from a list of
arbitrators who satisfy the criteria set forth in clause "(iv)" hereof.

(iv) The arbitrator shall be instructed to hold an up to eight hour, one day
hearing regarding the disputed matter within 60 days of his designation and to
render an award (without written opinion) no later than 10 days after the
conclusion of such hearing, in each case unless otherwise mutually agreed in
writing by Purchaser and the Sellers Agent.

(v) Purchaser and the Sellers Agent (on behalf of the Sellers) will each pay
50% of the initial compensation to be paid to the arbitrator in any such
arbitration and 50% of the costs of transcripts and other normal and regular
expenses of the arbitration proceedings; _provided, however,_ that: (A)
the prevailing party in any arbitration will be entitled to an award of
attorneys fees and costs; and (B) all costs of arbitration, other than those
provided for above, will

 



D-2   be paid by the losing party, and the arbitrator will be authorized to
determine the identity of the prevailing party and the losing party.

 

(vi) The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have
the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration
provisions or any other provisions contained in this _Exhibit D_ or the
Agreement.

(vii) Except as specifically otherwise provided in this _Exhibit D_ or the
Agreement, arbitration will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the parties
for any Arbitrable Dispute or any other dispute arising out of or relating to
this _Exhibit D_ or the Agreement.

(g) Upon resolution of the arbitration described in clause "(f)" of this
_Exhibit D_ , the Sellers Agent shall (subject to the order of recourse
contemplated by Section 5.9), within 10 business days following the entry of
the arbitrators decision by a court of competent jurisdiction, or such
shorter period of time as may be set forth in the arbitrators decision, cause
the Sellers to pay the amount of the award specified in the arbitrators
decision, if any, to Purchaser.
