outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

(b) _FNBB Common Stock_. Subject to Sections 3.02, 3.05 and 3.06, each share
of FNBB Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into, and shall be canceled in exchange for, the right
to receive 0.98 shares of TriCo Common Stock (as may be adjusted as provided
in this Agreement, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "). Any shares of FNBB Common Stock
owned by FNBB as treasury stock or owned, directly or indirectly, by FNBB,
TriCo or any of TriCos subsidiaries (other than those held in a fiduciary
capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted) shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time of the
Merger and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

 

3.02 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) _Mailing of Transmittal Material_. Provided that FNBB has delivered, or
caused to be delivered, to Computershare, Inc. (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") all
information which is reasonably necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform
its obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall, promptly
following the Effective Date (but in no event more than five 

 



-11-  (5) Business Days after the Effective Date), mail and otherwise make
available to each holder of record of FNBB Common Stock, a notice and a form
of letter of transmittal, in a form reasonably acceptable to, and approved in
writing by, FNBB (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to such Certificate(s) theretofore representing shares
of FNBB Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
Certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent or transfer of Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent), advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and
the procedure for surrendering to the Exchange Agent such Certificate(s)
or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration to which such
holder may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(b) hereof. A letter of
transmittal will be properly completed only if accompanied by Certificate or
Certificates or instructions to transfer Book-Entry Shares representing all
shares of FNBB Common Stock covered thereby, subject to the provisions of
paragraph (d) of this Section 3.02.

 

(b) _TriCo Deliveries_. At the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders
of Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares, TriCo shall deliver to the Exchange
Agent certificates, or at TriCos option, evidence of shares in book entry
form, representing the number of shares of TriCo Common Stock issuable to the
holders of FNBB Common Stock as the Merger Consideration, to be given to the
holders of FNBB Common Stock in exchange for their Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares as provided for in this _Article III_. The Exchange Agent shall not be
entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to
the shares of TriCo Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder,
except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions
paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the Persons
entitled thereto.

 

(c) _Exchange Agent Deliveries_.

 

(i) Each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares who has surrendered such Certificate or Certificates to the Exchange
Agent will, upon acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to
evidence of issuance in book entry form, or upon written request of such
holder, a certificate or certificates representing, the number of whole shares
of TriCo Common Stock into which the aggregate number of shares of FNBB
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement and any other distribution theretofore paid with respect to TriCo
Common Stock issuable in the Merger, in each case, without interest. The
Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent
may impose consistent with the notice and form of letter of transmittal to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices.

 

(ii) Each outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Share which prior to the
Effective Time represented FNBB Common Stock and which is not surrendered to
the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures provided for herein
shall, except as otherwise herein provided, until duly surrendered to the
Exchange Agent, be deemed to evidence ownership of the number of shares of
TriCo Common Stock into which such FNBB Common Stock shall have been
converted. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the
records of FNBB of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of
FNBB Common Stock and, if such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to FNBB for

 



-12-  transfer, they shall be cancelled against delivery of certificates for TriCo
Common Stock as hereinabove provided. No dividends which have been declared
will be remitted to any Person entitled to receive shares of TriCo Common
Stock under Section 3.01 until such Person surrenders the Certificate or
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing FNBB Common Stock, at which
time such dividends shall be remitted to such Person, without interest.

(d) _Lost or Destroyed Certificates; Issuances of TriCo Common Stock in New
Names_. The Exchange Agent and TriCo, as the case may be, shall not be
obligated to deliver a certificate or certificates representing shares of
TriCo Common Stock to which a holder of FNBB Common Stock would otherwise be
entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders
the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of FNBB Common Stock
for exchange as provided in this Section 3.02, or, in default thereof, an
appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an
amount as may be reasonably required in each case by TriCo. If any
certificates evidencing shares of TriCo Common Stock are to be issued in a
name other than that in which the Certificate evidencing FNBB Common Stock
surrendered in exchange therefore is registered, it shall be a condition of
the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the
Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax
required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of TriCo Common
Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e)  _Unclaimed Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the shares of TriCo
Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by TriCo pursuant to Section
3.02(b) that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of FNBB for twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment
thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to TriCo. Any shareholders
of FNBB who have not theretofore complied with Section 3.02(c) shall
thereafter look only to TriCo for the consideration deliverable in respect of
each share of FNBB Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant
to this Agreement without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed
prior to the date on which such shares of TriCo Common Stock would otherwise
escheat to any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the
extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become
the property of TriCo (and to the extent not in its possession shall be
delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of stock represented by any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any consideration paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
TriCo and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock
transfer books of FNBB to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to
receive the consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be
conclusive (absent manifest error) with respect thereto. In the event of a
dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, TriCo and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit
any consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third
party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

 



-13- 3.03 _Rights as Shareholders_. At the Effective Time, holders of FNBB Common
Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of FNBB
other than to receive the consideration provided for under this _Article III_.

 

3.04 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of TriCo
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of FNBB Common Stock
who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of TriCo
Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without
interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the TriCo Average Closing
Price, rounded to the nearest whole cent. No such holder shall be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional
share.

3.05  _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. If, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, the shares of TriCo Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment,
or similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a
record date within said period, the Merger Consideration and Exchange
Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly _; provided that_ a bona fide offering or
sale of TriCo Common Stock for fair value received shall not be deemed a
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or readjustment of the TriCo Common Stock.

3.06 _Withholding Rights_. TriCo (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable)
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of FNBB Common Stock such
amounts as TriCo is required under the Code or any state, local or foreign Tax
law or regulation thereunder to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment. Any amounts so withheld shall be timely remitted to
the applicable Governmental Entity and shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of FNBB Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by TriCo.

3.07 _FNBB Options_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, each FNBB Option, whether vested or unvested, shall
be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such FNBB Option to
receive, as soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of FNBB
Common Stock subject to such FNBB Option multiplied by (ii) the amount, if
any, that the product of the TriCo Average Closing Price multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio exceeds the exercise price per share of such FNBB Option,
_less_ any applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment (such amount, the " _Option Consideration_ "); _provided that_ to the
extent reasonably practicable and permitted by Code Section 409A, TriCo may
elect to fund the Option Consideration to be paid with respect to FNBB Options
by funding the necessary amounts to the payroll processor of FNBB or TriCo or
any of their respective Affiliates (the " _Payroll Processor_ ") for payment
by the Payroll Processor of the Option Consideration to the applicable holders
of such FNBB Options. For the avoidance of doubt, any FNBB Option which has
an exercise price per share of FNBB Common Stock that is greater than or equal
to the product of the TriCo Average Closing Price multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or
payment.

 



-14- (b) At least fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date and prior to any such
payment, FNBB shall obtain a written acknowledgement and waiver (in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to FNBB and TriCo) from each holder of an
FNBB Option (i) confirming the number of FNBB Options held (and shares of FNBB
Common Stock subject to such FNBB Options), (ii) confirming that the
treatment of such FNBB Options pursuant to this Agreement and the amounts to
be paid pursuant to this Agreement have been correctly calculated and (iii)
acknowledging that in consideration for the cancellation of such FNBB Option,
the holder agrees to accept the Option Consideration. FNBB shall provide a
copy of each such acknowledgement and waiver to TriCo at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the FNBB Board shall adopt any necessary
resolutions and take any actions necessary to (i) effectuate the provisions
of Section 3.07(a) and 3.07(b) and (ii) cause all FNBB Options to vest in full
as of the Effective Time to the extent permitted under the applicable FNBB
Option Plan and be terminated as of the Effective Time.

response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof
or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
Section 5.03 or 5.04 or to one or more of its covenants contained in _Articles
IV_ or _VI_ ; _provided, however_ , that the mere inclusion of an item in a
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not
be deemed an admission by a party that such item represents a material
exception or fact, event or circumstance or that, absent such inclusion
in the Disclosure Schedule, such item is or would be reasonably likely to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

5.02 _Standard_ _. _ Solely for the purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.02(a) or 7.03(a), as the case may be, have
been satisfied (and without otherwise qualifying any representation or
warranty made on the date hereof), no representation or warranty of FNBB on
the one hand or TriCo on the other hand contained in Sections 5.03 or 5.04,
respectively (other than (a) the representations of FNBB contained in Section

true and correct in all respects, and (c) the representations of FNBB
contained in Section 5.03(m)(v), which shall be true in all material respects)
shall be deemed untrue or incorrect for purposes of Sections 7.02(a) or
7.03(a), and no party hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation
or warranty for purposes of such Sections, as a consequence of the existence
of any fact, event or circumstance unless such fact, circumstance or event,
individually or taken together with all other facts, events or circumstances
inconsistent with any representation or warranty contained in Sections 5.03 or
5.04, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
party making such representation or warranty.

FNBB has in effect all federal, state, local and foreign governmental
authorizations necessary for it to own or lease its properties and assets and
to carry on its business as now conducted. The copies of the FNBB Articles and
FNBB Bylaws set forth in Section 5.03(a) of FNBBs Disclosure Schedule are

any Governmental Entity. FNBB and its Subsidiaries have paid all assessments
made or imposed by any Governmental Entity.

agreement, memorandum of understanding, board resolution, commitment letter,
supervisory letter or similar submission or any request for the adoption of
any policy, procedure or board resolution.

Transaction. True, correct and complete copies of all such Material Contracts
have been made available to TriCo as of the date hereof.

 

(ii) Each of the Material Contracts is in full force and effect (other than

of FNBB or its Subsidiaries and, to FNBBs Knowledge, is a valid and binding
obligation of the other parties thereto, enforceable against FNBB or its

Each Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the

IRS, and FNBB has no Knowledge of any circumstances reasonably likely to
result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter or the loss of
the qualification of such Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code.
Neither FNBB nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any correspondence or
written or verbal notice from the IRS, DOL, any other Governmental Entity, any
participant in or beneficiary of, a Benefit Plan, or any agent representing
any of the foregoing that brings into question the qualification of any such

Subsidiaries is subject to or could reasonably be likely to be subject to a
material Tax, fine, penalty or material liability of any kind under either the
Code or ERISA. There are no matters pending before the IRS, DOL or other
Governmental Entity with respect to any Benefit Plan. Since January 1, 2013,
no Benefit Plan or related trust has been the subject of an audit,
investigation or examination by a Governmental Entity.

(iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Benefit Plan
(including any amounts withheld from employees paychecks with respect to a
Benefit Plan) and premiums required to be paid have been timely made in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Benefit Plan and applicable law.
All contributions for any period ending on or before the Closing Date that are
not yet due have been made or have been reflected appropriately in the

arrangements subject to Sections 125 and 105 of the Code and health savings
accounts, are provided exclusively through insurance contracts or policies
issued by an insurance company, health maintenance organization, or similar
organization unrelated to FNBB or any ERISA Affiliate, the premiums for which
are paid directly by FNBB or an ERISA Affiliate thereof, from its general
assets or partly from its general assets and partly from contributions by its
employees. No insurance policy or contract relating to a Benefit Plan requires
or permits a retroactive increase to premiums or payments due thereunder.

 

(v) Except as set forth in Section 5.03(m)(v) of FNBBs Disclosure Schedule,

(within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) (hereinafter referred to as
an " _FNBB NQDP_ ") has been maintained, as to both form and operation, in

been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect
only actual transactions.

(ii) Except as set forth on the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of TriCo
dated as of September 30, 2017 and included in TriCos SEC Reports filed
prior to the date hereof, neither TriCo nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
material liability (whether absolute, contingent or accrued or otherwise and
whether due or to become due) that would be required to be reflected on a
balance sheet or in notes thereto prepared in accordance with GAAP, other than
liabilities (A) incurred after September 30, 2017 in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice or (B) incurred pursuant to or
provided for in this Agreement.

(iii) Since December 31, 2016, no event has occurred or circumstance arisen
that, individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances and
events (described in any paragraph of this Section 5.04(g) or otherwise), is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to TriCo.

their respective businesses in the ordinary and usual course consistent with
past practice, (B) neither TriCo nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken nor
permitted or entered into any contract with respect to, or otherwise agreed or
committed to do or take, any action that, if taken after the date
hereof, would constitute a breach of any of the covenants in Section 4.02 and
(C) no event has occurred or circumstance arisen that, individually or taken

all litigation, arbitration, claims or other proceedings before any court or
Governmental Entity that is pending against TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries
as of the date hereof. Except as set forth in Section 5.04(h) of TriCos
Disclosure Schedule, no litigation, arbitration, claim or other proceeding
before any court or Governmental Entity is pending against TriCo or any of its
Subsidiaries and, to TriCos Knowledge, no such litigation, arbitration,
claim or other proceeding has been threatened and there are no facts which
could reasonably give rise to such litigation, arbitration, claim or other
proceeding in any such case that, individually or in the aggregate, has or
could be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
TriCo. Neither TriCo nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
properties is a party to or subject to any order, judgment, decree or
regulatory restrictions that, individually or in the aggregate, has or could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
TriCo.

 

(i) _No Brokers._ No action has been taken by TriCo or its Subsidiaries that
would give rise to any valid claim against any party hereto for a brokerage
commission, finders fee or other like payment with respect to the
Transaction, other than a fee payable by TriCo to Stephens, Inc.

 



-47- (j) _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(i) Since December 31, 2013, TriCo and each of its Subsidiaries has duly filed
with the appropriate bank regulatory authorities in substantially correct
form the monthly, quarterly and annual reports required to be filed under
applicable laws and regulations, and such reports were in all material
respects complete, accurate and in compliance with the requirements of
applicable laws and regulations. In connection with the most recent
examination of TriCo and each of its Subsidiaries by the appropriate
regulatory authorities, neither TriCo nor any of its Subsidiaries was required
to correct or change any action, procedure or proceeding which TriCo believes
in good faith has not now been corrected or changed, other than corrections or
changes which, if not made, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on TriCo.

 

(ii) Neither TriCo nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
properties is a party to or is subject to any order, decree, directive,
agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement with, or a
commitment letter or similar submission to, or extraordinary supervisory
letter from, nor has TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries adopted any policies,
procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of, any
Governmental Entity. TriCo and its Subsidiaries have paid all assessments made
or imposed by any Governmental Entity.

 

(iii) Neither TriCo nor any its Subsidiaries has been advised by, and does not
have any Knowledge of facts which would reasonably be expected to give rise
to an advisory notice by, any Governmental Entity that such Governmental
Entity is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is considering the
appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order, decree, directive,
agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment letter, supervisory letter
or similar submission or any request for the adoption of any policy, procedure
or board resolution.

 

(iv) (A) No Governmental Entity has initiated since December 31, 2013 or has
pending any proceeding, enforcement action or, to TriCos Knowledge,
investigation or inquiry into the business, operations, policies, practices or
disclosures of TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries (other than normal
examinations conducted by a Governmental Entity in the ordinary course of
the business of TriCo or the applicable Subsidiary), or, to TriCos
Knowledge, threatened any of the foregoing, and (B) there is no unresolved
violation, criticism, comment or exception by any Governmental Entity with
respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or
inspections of TriCo or its Subsidiaries, except in each case in subparagraphs
(A) and (B), that did not have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(v) TriCo and Tri Counties are "well-capitalized" (as that term is defined at
12 CFR §225.2(r) or the relevant regulation of its primary federal bank
regulator). The most recent regulatory rating given to Tri Counties as to
compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act is no less than "satisfactory."
Neither TriCo nor Tri Counties has received any notification from a
Governmental Entity that their status as "well-capitalized" or "satisfactory"

 



-48-  for Community Reinvestment Act purposes will change within one year, nor
does TriCo have Knowledge of any conditions or circumstances that would result
in a Community Reinvestment Act rating of less than "satisfactory" or
material criticism from regulators with respect to discriminatory lending
practices.

(k)  _Compliance With Laws._ Each of TriCo and its Subsidiaries:

(i) is, and at all times since December 31, 2013 has been in material
compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes,
laws, codes, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, injunctions, orders,
decrees or policies and/or guidelines of any Governmental Entity applicable
thereto or to their employees conducting such businesses, including, without
limitation, Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and FRB and FDIC
regulations pursuant thereto, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair
Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure
Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and
Regulation E of the FRB, all other applicable fair lending laws and other
laws relating to discriminatory business practices and Environmental Laws and
all posted and internal policies of TriCo and its Subsidiaries related to
customer data, privacy and security;

 

(ii) has, and at all times since December 31, 2013 has had, all permits,
licenses, franchises, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made
all filings, applications and registrations with, all Governmental Entities
(and has paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection
therewith) that are required in order to permit them to own or lease their
properties and to conduct their businesses as presently conducted; all such
permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full
force and effect and, to TriCos Knowledge, no suspension or cancellation of
any of them is threatened; and

(iii) has received no notification or communication from any Governmental
Entity (A) asserting that TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries is not in
compliance with any of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which such
Governmental Entity enforces or (B) threatening to revoke any license,
franchise, permit or governmental authorization (nor, to TriCos Knowledge,
do any grounds for any of the foregoing exist).

(l) _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(i) All material benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or
arrangements maintained, contributed to, obligated to be contributed to, or
sponsored by TriCo and Tri Counties for the benefit of current or former
employees of TriCo and its Subsidiaries and current or former directors or
independent contractors of TriCo and its Subsidiaries including, but not
limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA, any pension, retirement, profit sharing, medical, life, accidental
death and dismemberment, disability, dental, vision, compensation, severance,
termination pay, salary continuation, unemployment, workers compensation,
vacation, sick pay, paid-time off, retention, employment, consulting, change
in control, fringe benefit, deferred compensation, stock option, stock
purchase, stock appreciation rights or other stock-based incentive, cafeteria
or flexible benefit, adoption or educational assistance, and bonus or other
cash-based incentive, or other similar plans,

 



-49-  agreements, programs, policies or other arrangements (whether written or
oral and whether or not qualified or funded) or any such plan for which TriCo
and its Subsidiaries may have any liability including, without limitation, as
a result of being deemed a single employer with any entity under Section
4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (collectively, the " _TriCo
Benefit Plans_ "), have been provided or made available to FNBB.

(ii) Each TriCo Benefit Plan has been established and administered to date in
all material respects in accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA,
the Code and applicable law and with the terms and provisions of all
documents, contracts or agreements pursuant to which such TriCo Benefit Plan
is maintained.

 

(iii) Other than as disclosed and identified as such in Section 5.04(l)(iii)
of TriCos Disclosure Schedule, neither TriCo nor any entity considered to be
a single employer with TriCo under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414
of the Code maintains or contributes to any pension plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA, to any multiemployer plan (as defined in 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), or
to any TriCo Benefit Plan providing for retiree health and life benefits,
other than coverage as may be required under Section 4980B of the Code or Part
6 of Title I of ERISA or under the continuation of coverage provisions of the
laws of any state or locality.

(m) _Tax Matters._ (i) All Tax Returns that are required to be filed on
or before the Closing Date (taking into account any extensions of time within
which to file that have not expired) by or with respect to TriCo or any of its
Subsidiaries have been or will be timely filed on or before the Closing Date,
(ii) all such Tax Returns are or will be true, correct and complete in all
material respects, (iii) all Taxes due and payable by or with respect to TriCo
or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown as due on any Tax Return)
have been timely paid in full, (iv) the unpaid Taxes of TriCo and its
Subsidiaries did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements,
exceed the reserve for Tax liability set forth on the face of such financial
statements and do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time
through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of
TriCo and its Subsidiaries in filing its Tax Returns, (v) all deficiencies
asserted or assessments made as a result of examinations conducted by any
taxing authority have been paid in full, (vi) no issues that have been raised
by the relevant taxing authority in connection with the examination of any of
the Tax Returns referred to in clause (v) are currently pending, and (vii) no
claim has been made in writing in the past five (5) years by a taxing
authority in a jurisdiction where TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries does not
already file Tax Returns that TriCo or a Subsidiary is or may be subject
to taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither Trico nor any of its Subsidiaries
has taken any action or failed to take any action, or is aware of any fact or
circumstance, in each case, that could reasonably be expected to prevent the
Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. TriCo has made available to FNBB (A) true and correct
copies of the U.S. federal and state income tax returns filed by or on behalf
of TriCo and its Subsidiaries for the most recent three (3) years and (B) any
audit reports by the respective taxing authorities making adjustments to those
returns.

 

(n) _Required Vote; Antitakeover Provisions_. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of TriCo Common Stock
entitled to vote is necessary to approve this Agreement and the Transaction on
behalf of TriCo. No other vote of the shareholders of TriCo is required by
law, the TriCo Articles, the TriCo Bylaws, the rules of Nasdaq or otherwise to
approve this Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement and the Transaction.

 



-50- (o) _Ownership of FNBB Common Stock._ None of TriCo or any of its
Subsidiaries, or to TriCos Knowledge, any of its other affiliates or
associates (as such terms are defined under the Exchange Act), owns
beneficially or of record, directly or indirectly, or is a party to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring,
holding, voting or disposing of, shares of FNBB Common Stock (other than
shares held in a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially owned by third
parties, shares held in an index or mutual fund, or as a result of
debts previously contracted).

(p) _Required Vote; Antitakeover Provisions_. No "control share acquisition,"
"business combination moratorium," "fair price" or other form of antitakeover
statute or regulation under the CGCL or any applicable provisions of the
takeover laws of any other state (and any comparable provisions of the TriCo
Articles and TriCo Bylaws), apply or will apply to this Agreement, the Bank
Merger Agreement or the Transaction.

(q) _Disclosure._ The representations and warranties contained in this
Section 5.04, when considered as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements and information contained in this Section 5.04 not
misleading.

(r) _No Additional Representations._ Except for the representations
and warranties made by TriCo in this Section 5.04 and as Previously
Disclosed, neither TriCo nor any other Person makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to TriCo, its Subsidiaries, or their
respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial
or otherwise) or prospects, and TriCo hereby expressly disclaims any such
other representations or warranties.

 

ARTICLE VI

COVENANTS 

6.01 _Reasonable Best Efforts_ _._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of FNBB and TriCo agrees to use its commercially reasonable
best efforts in good faith, and to cause their respective Subsidiaries to use
their commercially reasonable best efforts in good faith, to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or desirable, or advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit
consummation of the Transaction as promptly as practicable and otherwise to
enable consummation of the Transaction, including the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof, and shall cooperate fully
with the other party hereto to that end.

6.02 _Shareholder Approval_.

(a) FNBB agrees to take, in accordance with applicable law and the FNBB
Articles and the FNBB Bylaws, all action necessary to convene as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement becomes effective, a
special meeting of its shareholders to

 



-51-  consider and vote upon the approval of this Agreement, including the Merger,
and any other matters required to be approved by FNBBs shareholders for
consummation of the Transaction (including any adjournment or postponement,
the " _FNBB Meeting_ ") _._ Except with the prior approval of TriCo, no other
matters shall be submitted for the approval of the FNBB shareholders at the
FNBB Meeting. Subject to Section 6.02(b), the FNBB Board shall at all times
prior to and during such FNBB Meeting recommend such approval and shall take
all reasonable lawful action to solicit such approval by its shareholders and
shall not (x) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to TriCo such
recommendation or (y) take any other action or make any other public statement
in connection with the FNBB Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation
(collectively, a " _Change in Recommendation_ "), except as and to the extent
permitted by Section 6.02(b). Notwithstanding any Change in Recommendation,
this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of FNBB at the FNBB
Meeting for the purpose of approving the Agreement and any other matters
required to be approved by FNBBs shareholders for consummation of the
Transaction. In addition to the foregoing, FNBB shall not submit to the vote
of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger. FNBB
hereby acknowledges its obligation to submit this Agreement to its
shareholders at the FNBB Meeting as provided in this Section 6.02(a).

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, FNBB and the FNBB Board shall be permitted
to effect a Change in Recommendation if and only to the extent that:

(i) FNBB shall have complied in all material respects with Section 6.07;

 

(ii) the FNBB Board, after consulting with its outside counsel and financial
advisor, shall have determined in good faith that failure to do so would
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

(iii) if the FNBB Board intends to effect a Change in Recommendation
following receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, (A) the FNBB Board shall have
concluded in good faith, after giving effect to all of the adjustments which
may be offered by TriCo pursuant to clause (C) below, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) FNBB shall notify TriCo, at
least five (5) Business Days in advance, of its intention to effect a Change
in Recommendation in response to such Superior Proposal (including
the identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal) and furnish to
TriCo all the material terms and conditions of such proposal, and (C) prior to
effecting such a Change in Recommendation, FNBB shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors to, during the period following FNBBs delivery
of the notice referred to in clause (B) above, negotiate with TriCo in good
faith for a period of up to five (5) Business Days (to the extent TriCo
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal.

It is understood that and agreed that any amendment or modification to the
financial or other material terms of the Acquisition Proposal giving rise to
the FNBBs notice of a Superior Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition
Proposal giving rise to a new obligation to provide notice and a new five (5)
Business Day response period for TriCo, consequently extending the periods
referenced in Sections 6.02(b)(iii) above.

 



-52- (c) TriCo agrees to take, in accordance with applicable law and the TriCo

Agreement, the Merger and the issuance of the TriCo Common Stock in the
Merger and any other matters required to be approved by TriCos shareholders
for consummation of the Transaction (including any adjournment or
postponement, the " _TriCo Meeting_ "). The TriCo Board shall at all times
prior to and during the TriCo Meeting recommend approval of this Agreement,
the Merger and the issuance of the TriCo Common Stock in the Merger and any
other matters required to be approved by TriCos shareholders for
consummation of the Transaction contemplated hereby and shall take all
reasonable lawful action to solicit such approval by its shareholders.

(d) FNBB and TriCo shall cooperate to schedule and convene the FNBB Meeting
and the TriCo Meeting on the same date.

6.03 _Registration Statement_.

(a) TriCo agrees to prepare a registration statement on Form S-4 or
other applicable form (the " _Registration Statement_ ") to be filed by TriCo
with the SEC in connection with the issuance of the shares of TriCo Common
Stock to the FNBB shareholders as the Merger Consideration in the Merger

to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy Statement and
any amendment or supplement thereto shall, at the date(s) of mailing to

or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading. Each of FNBB and TriCo further
agrees that if such party shall become aware prior to the date of
effectiveness of the Registration Statement of any information furnished
by such party that would cause any of the statements in the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform the other
parties thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement.

 

(c) TriCo agrees to advise FNBB promptly in writing after TriCo receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the
issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of TriCo

it) (all of the foregoing, collectively, " _Representatives_ ")
to, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any other parties
that may be ongoing

 



-56-  with respect to the possibility or consideration of any Acquisition
Proposal, and will use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal,
including by requesting the other party to promptly return or destroy any
confidential information previously furnished by or on behalf of FNBB or any
of its Subsidiaries thereunder and by specifically enforcing the
terms thereof in a court of competent jurisdiction. From the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, neither FNBB nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, and shall cause their respective directors, officers or employees or
any Representative retained by them not to, directly or indirectly through
another Person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of
furnishing information or assistance), or take any other action designed to
facilitate or that is likely to result in, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) provide any confidential information or data to any
Person relating to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) waive,
terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any contractual
"standstill" or similar obligations of any Person other than TriCo or its
Affiliates, (v) approve or recommend, propose to approve or recommend, or
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement,
option agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition
Proposal or propose to do any of the foregoing, or (vi) make or authorize any
statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition
Proposal; _provided, however_ , that prior to the date of the FNBB Meeting,
if the FNBB Board determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside
legal and financial advisors, that the failure to do so would breach, or would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of, the FNBB Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable law, FNBB may, in response to a bona fide, written
Acquisition Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section 6.07(a) that
the FNBB Board determines in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal,
subject to providing two (2) Business Days prior written notice of its
decision to take such action to TriCo and identifying the Person making the
proposal and all the material terms and conditions of such proposal and
compliance with Section 6.07(b), (1) furnish information with respect to
itself to any Person making such a Superior Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (as determined by FNBB after consultation with
its outside counsel) on terms no more favorable to such Person than the terms
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement are to TriCo, and (2) participate
in discussions or negotiations regarding such a Superior Proposal. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer, filing of any regulatory application or notice or
disclosure of an intention to do any of the foregoing from any Person relating
to any (w) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that
constitutes 10% or more of the total revenues, net income, assets or deposits
of FNBB and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (x) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of any class of Equity Securities representing 10% or
more of the voting power of FNBB or First National Bank, (y) tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially
owning 10% or more of any class of Equity Securities of FNBB or First
National Bank or (z) merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
FNBB or First National Bank, other than the Transaction contemplated by
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Superior
Proposal_ " means any bona fide written proposal made by a third party to
acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction, for
consideration consisting of cash and/or

 



-57-  securities, more than 50% of the combined voting power of the shares of FNBB
Common Stock then outstanding or all or substantially all of FNBBs
consolidated assets, which the FNBB Board determines in good faith, after
taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal and the person making the proposal (including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), and after
consulting with FNBBs financial advisor (which shall be a recognized
investment banking firm) and outside counsel, (i) is more favorable from a
financial point of view to its shareholders than the Transaction, (ii) is
reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms set forth, and (iii) for
which financing, to the extent required, is then committed or which, in the
good faith judgment of the FNBB Board, is reasonably likely to be obtained by
such third party.

(b) In addition to the obligations of FNBB set forth in Section 6.07(a),
FNBB shall promptly (within 24 hours) advise TriCo orally and in writing of
its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and keep TriCo reasonably informed, on
a current basis, of the continuing status thereof, including the material
terms and conditions thereof and any material changes thereto, and shall
contemporaneously provide to TriCo all materials provided to or made available
to any third party pursuant to this Section 6.07 which were not previously
provided to TriCo.

 

(c) FNBB agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.07 by any Representative of FNBB or its Subsidiaries shall be
deemed a breach of this Section 6.07 by FNBB.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent FNBB or the FNBB
Board from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(e) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
any of the restrictions set forth in Section 6.07(a) were violated by FNBB,
its Subsidiaries or any Representative of FNBB or its Subsidiaries. It is
accordingly agreed that TriCo shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of Section 6.07 and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions thereof in any court of the United States or any
state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
TriCo is entitled at law or in equity. In the event attorneys fees or other
costs are incurred to secure performance of any of the obligations herein
provided for, or to establish damages for the breach thereof, or to obtain any
other appropriate relief, whether by way of prosecution or defense, TriCo
shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred
therein.

6.08 _Certain Policies_ _._ Prior to the Effective Date, upon the request
of TriCo, FNBB shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, consistent with
GAAP and applicable banking laws and regulations, use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to modify or change their Loan, OREO, accrual,
reserve, Tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices
(including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on
a basis that is consistent with that of TriCo; _provided, however_ , that no
such modifications or changes need be made prior to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b); and _further provided_ that in any
event, no such modification or change made by FNBB or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Section 6.08 shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach,
violation of or failure to satisfy any

 



-58-  representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other provision
of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such
breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of
any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of
previously furnished financial statements or information and shall not be
construed as concurrence of FNBB or its management with any such adjustments.

6.09 _Nasdaq Listing_ _._ TriCo shall, as promptly as practicable, file all
documents, take all actions reasonably necessary and otherwise use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to list, prior to the Effective Date, on
the Nasdaq the shares of TriCo Common Stock to be issued to the FNBB
shareholders as the Merger Consideration.

 

6.10 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time, TriCo and the Surviving Corporation (each an "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director, officer and employee of FNBB or First National Bank, as
applicable, determined as of the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Parties_
") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, arising in whole
or in part out of or pertaining to the fact that he or she was a director,
officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of FNBB or any FNBB Subsidiary or is or
was serving at the request of FNBB or any FNBB Subsidiary as a director,
officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including, without limitation,
matters related to the negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement or consummation of the Transaction, to the fullest extent which such
Indemnified Parties would be entitled under the FNBB Articles and the
FNBB Bylaws or, as applicable, the First National Bank Articles and the First
National Bank Bylaws or any agreement, arrangement or understanding which has
been set forth in Section 6.10 of FNBBs Disclosure Schedule, in each case as
in effect on the date hereof. TriCo shall also cause the Surviving
Corporation to advance expenses as incurred by such Indemnified Parties to the
same extent as such persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the
date of this Agreement by FNBB pursuant to the FNBB Articles and the FNBB
Bylaws or, as applicable, the First National Bank Articles or the First
National Bank Bylaws or any agreement, arrangement or understanding which has
been set forth in Section 6.10 of FNBBs Disclosure Schedule, in each case as
in effect on the date hereof.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
6.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure
to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may
have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice
the Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time), (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified
Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the
defense

 



-59-  thereof, except that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such
defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues
which raise conflicts of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Parties that make joint representation inappropriate, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly
as statements therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any
jurisdiction unless the Indemnified Parties have conflicts of interest), (ii)
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
(iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no
obligation hereunder in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine by final, non-appealable
written order that indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable laws and regulations.

(c) TriCo (and the Surviving Corporation) shall maintain FNBBs existing
directors and officers liability insurance policy (or provide a policy
providing comparable coverage and amounts on terms no less favorable to the
persons currently covered by FNBBs existing policy, including TriCos
existing policy if it meets the foregoing standard) covering persons who are
currently covered by such insurance for a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time;  _provided, however,_ that in no event shall TriCo be
obligated to expend, in order to maintain or provide insurance coverage
pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), an amount in excess of two hundred percent
(200%) of the annual premiums paid by FNBB as of the date hereof for such
insurance (" _Maximum Insurance Amount_ "); _provided further_ , that if the
amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Insurance Amount, TriCo shall obtain the most
advantageous coverage obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Insurance Amount.

(d) If TriCo or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of TriCo shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.10 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and (ii) in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

 

6.11 _Benefit Plans_.

(a) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, TriCo
shall take all reasonable action so that employees of FNBB and its
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in each TriCo Benefit Plan of
general applicability to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of
TriCo and its Subsidiaries (it being understood that inclusion of the
employees of FNBB and its Subsidiaries in the TriCo Benefit Plans may occur at
different times with respect to different plans),  _provided that_ coverage
shall be continued under the

 



-60-  corresponding Benefit Plans of FNBB and its Subsidiaries until such
employees are permitted to participate in the TriCo Benefit Plans and
_provided further_ , however, that nothing contained herein shall require
TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries to make any grants to any former employee of
FNBB and its Subsidiaries under any discretionary equity compensation plan of
TriCo. TriCo shall cause each TriCo Benefit Plan in which employees of FNBB
and its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to recognize, for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate in, the vesting of benefits and for all
other purposes (but not for accrual of pension benefits, if applicable) under
the TriCo Benefit Plans, the service of such employees with FNBB and its
Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was credited for such purpose
by FNBB and its Subsidiaries, provided, however, that such service shall not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits or to the extent not otherwise permissible under the
terms of a TriCo Benefit Plan, _provide further_ , that an employees
eligibility to participate will be governed by the eligibility criteria of
the particular TriCo Benefit Plan. Nothing herein shall limit the ability of
TriCo to amend or terminate any of the TriCo Benefit Plans or the FNBB Benefit
Plans in accordance with their terms at any time.

 

(b) At and following the Effective Time, TriCo shall honor, and the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to be obligated to perform, in accordance with
their terms, all benefit obligations to, and contractual rights of, current
and former employees of FNBB and its Subsidiaries and current and former
directors of FNBB and its Subsidiaries existing as of the Effective Date, as
well as all bonus, deferred compensation, supplemental retirement plan,
salary continuation, severance, termination, change in control and other
existing plans and policies of FNBB and its Subsidiaries to the extent that
each of the foregoing are Previously Disclosed.

(c) At such time as employees of FNBB and its Subsidiaries become eligible to
participate in a medical, dental, health, life or disability plan of TriCo or
its Subsidiaries, TriCo shall cause each such plan to (i) waive any
preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered
under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of TriCo, (ii) provide
full credit under medical, health and dental plans for any deductibles, co-
payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their
beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year prior to such
participation and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or evidence of
insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to such employee
on or after the Effective Time to the extent such employee had satisfied any
similar limitation or requirement under a corresponding FNBB Benefit Plan
prior to the Effective Time, provided, however, that such waiver shall not
be required to the extent that such waiver would result in a duplication of
benefits or to the extent not otherwise permissible under the terms of a
contract insuring benefits under the TriCo Benefit Plans.

 

(d) Those employees of FNBB and its Subsidiaries (i) who are not offered
employment by TriCo or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, who are
not a party to an employment agreement or otherwise entitled to an existing
severance package, change in control benefit or payments under any salary
continuation plan, and who sign and deliver (and do not revoke) a termination
and release agreement in a form acceptable to TriCo within forty-five (45)
days of the Effective Time or (ii) who are terminated by TriCo without cause
prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Time and deliver (and do not
revoke) a termination and release agreement in a form acceptable to TriCo
within forty-five (45) days of termination, shall be entitled to receive a
single lump sum payment of severance in an amount and in accordance with 

 



-61-  the terms of the severance policy set forth in Section 6.11(d) of FNBBs
Disclosure Schedule. If FNBB or any of its Subsidiaries has any other
severance pay plan or arrangement, then any amounts paid pursuant to that
plan or arrangement shall reduce the amount that the employee will receive
under this Section 6.11(d) and in no event shall there be any duplication of
severance pay. Nothing contained in this Section 6.11(d) hereof shall be
construed or interpreted to limit or modify in any way TriCos or its
Subsidiaries at will employment policy or provide any third party beneficiary
rights to employees of FNBB or any of its Subsidiaries. In no event shall
severance pay be taken into account in determining the amount of any other
benefit (including but not limited to, an individuals benefit under any
retirement plan or policy). For purposes of this Section 6.11(d), "cause"
shall mean the employees personal dishonesty, willful misconduct, breach of
fiduciary duty involving personal profit, failure to comply with any valid and
legal directive of TriCo, Tri Counties, FNBB and/or First National Bank
failure to perform stated duties, violation of any law, rule or regulation
(other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or order of any
Governmental Entity.

 

(e) Prior to the Closing, FNBB shall have paid into the FNB Bancorp Savings
Plan (the " _FNBB Retirement Plan_ ") all discretionary employer
contributions, including any employer matching contributions, profit sharing
contributions or other non-elective contributions. Prior to the Closing, FNBB
shall (i) adopt written resolutions (or take such other necessary or
appropriate action), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to TriCo, to
terminate the FNBB Retirement Plan in compliance with its terms and
requirements of applicable law, effective no later than the Business Day
preceding the Closing Date and (ii) provide for full vesting of all non-
elective contributions under the FNBB Retirement Plan for all participants who
currently maintain an account under the FNBB Retirement Plan, such
termination and vesting to be effective no later than the Business Day
preceding the Closing Date. FNBB shall provide TriCo with evidence of the
termination of the FNBB Retirement Plan.

 

(f) Prior to December 31, 2017, FNBB shall freeze or amend each FNBB NQDP to
close such plans to new participants and so that no participant may make any
contribution after December 31, 2017.

(g) Each of FNBB and TriCo acknowledges and agrees that all
provisions contained within this Section 6.11 with respect to Employees are
included for the sole benefit of FNBB and nothing contained in this Section
6.11 shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.11. Nothing contained herein
(i) shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program
or arrangement or (ii) alter or limit the ability of TriCo to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program or arrangement at any time established,
sponsored or maintained by TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries. Each of FNBB and
TriCo agrees that the terms of this Section 6.11 do not and shall not create
any right in any Person to continued employment with FNBB, TriCo or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or to any compensation or benefit.

6.12 _Appointment of Directors_. TriCo agrees to take all action necessary to
appoint or elect, effective as of the Effective Time, two individuals servings
as directors of FNBB on the date of this Agreement, each of whom shall be
mutually agreeable to TriCo and FNBB, as directors of each of TriCo and Tri
Counties. Each individual shall serve until the first annual meeting of
shareholders of TriCo following the Effective Time. Subject to the fiduciary
duties of the TriCo Board, TriCo shall include such individuals on the list
of nominees for director presented by the TriCo Board and for which the TriCo
Board shall solicit proxies at the first annual meeting of shareholders of
TriCo following the Effective Time.

 



-62- 6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_ _._ Each of FNBB and TriCo shall give
prompt written notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known
to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a failure
of any of the conditions provided for in _Article VII_.

6.14  _Estoppel Letters_ _._ FNBB shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to TriCo at the Closing with respect to the real
estate leased by FNBB or a FNBB Subsidiary, an estoppel letter from each of
its lessors dated as of the Closing in substantially the form of _Exhibit_ __
_ D_ attached hereto or such other form as may be reasonably acceptable to
TriCo.

 

6.15 _Antitakeover Statutes_ _._ Each of TriCo and FNBB and their respective
Boards of Directors shall, if any state antitakeover statute or similar
statute becomes applicable to this Agreement and the Transaction, take all
action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Transaction may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise
to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this Agreement and
the Transaction.

6.16 _Consents_ _._ FNBB shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
their commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain all consents, approvals,
waivers, non-objections and to deliver any notices required pursuant to the

6.17 _Exemption from Liability Under Section_ __ _ 16(b)_ _. _ Prior to the
Effective Time, each of TriCo and FNBB shall take all steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of FNBB Common
Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of

contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 

6.18 _Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings_. FNBB __ shall cooperate with TriCo

TriCo orally and in writing of any shareholder litigation or community-based
protests against FNBB or its directors relating to this Agreement, the Merger,
the Bank Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall
keep TriCo fully informed regarding any such shareholder litigation or
protests, including providing all relevant documentation. FNBB shall consult
with TriCo and give good faith consideration of its comments and advice and
give TriCo the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any
such litigation, provided that TriCo shall pay its own expenses, subject to
applicable law. No settlement in connection with such litigation or protests
shall be agreed to without TriCos prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



-63- 6.20 _Closing Financial Statements_. At least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger, FNBB shall provide TriCo with FNBBs
unaudited consolidated balance sheet and results of operations presenting the
financial condition of FNBB and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business
on the last day of the last month ended prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger and for the period beginning on the first date of the then-current
fiscal year through the close of business on the last day of the last month
ended prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (the " _Closing Financial

occurs on or before the fifth (5th) Business Day of the month, the
Closing Financial Statements shall instead be as of and through the end of
the second (2nd) month immediately preceding the Effective Time. The Closing
Financial Statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP (excluding
notes) and regulatory accounting principles and other applicable legal and
accounting requirements, and shall reflect all period-end accruals and other
adjustments, subject to the other requirements of this Agreement and shall
also reflect accruals for all fees and expenses incurred or expected to be

(whether or not doing so is in accordance with GAAP). The Closing Financial
Statements shall be accompanied by a certificate of FNBBs Chief Financial
Officer to the effect that such financial statements meet the requirements of
this Section 6.20. On the Closing Date, FNBBs Chief Financial Officer, shall
deliver to TriCo a certificate, dated as of the Effective Date, to the effect
that such financial statements continue to reflect accurately, as of the date
of the certificate, the financial condition of FNBB in all material
respects and the requirements of this Section 6.20.

6.21 _Customer Notices_ _._ On and after the later of the date of receipt of
all regulatory approvals required to consummate the Transaction (disregarding
any statutory waiting periods) and the date of receipt of approval of the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger, the Bank Merger and the transactions
contemplated thereby by FNBB shareholders, FNBB and First National Bank shall
permit TriCo and Tri Counties to provide one or more written notices (which
may be joint notices from First National Bank and Tri Counties) to customers
of FNBB and First National Bank describing the proposed Merger and the Bank
Merger, the effect on customers, planned transition procedures and similar
information. FNBB shall have the right to review and approve the substance any
such communications, provided that FNBB shall not unreasonably withhold,
delay or condition its approval.

6.22 _Professional Fees and Expenses_. FNBB shall cause final bills (or
estimated final bills through the Effective Time) for all fees and expenses

to a purchaser that is not an Affiliate of FNBB.

 

6.26 _Tax Treatment_ _._ The Merger contemplated by this Agreement is intended
to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the

Code. Until the Closing, each party to this Agreement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to so qualify, and will
not knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any
action or cause any action not to be taken, which action or failure to act
could prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a).

ARTICLE VII

 

CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER

 

7.01 _Conditions to Each Party_ __ _s Obligation to Effect the Merger_ _._
The respective obligation of each of the parties hereto to consummate the
Merger is subject to the fulfillment or, to the extent permitted by applicable

holders.

 

(b) _Regulatory Approvals._ All regulatory approvals required to consummate
the Merger shall have been obtained and shall remain in full force and effect
and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall have expired and no
such approvals shall contain any conditions, restrictions or requirements
(other than conditions or requirements related to remedial actions) which
the TriCo Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with
FNBB, would, individually or in the aggregate, materially reduce the economic
benefits of the Transaction to such a degree that TriCo would not have entered
into this Agreement had such conditions, restrictions or requirements been
known at the date hereof.

(c) _No Injunction._ No Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any statute, rule,
regulation, judgment, decree, injunction or other order which is in effect and
prohibits consummation of the Transaction.

representations and assumptions set forth in such opinion which are
consistent with the state of facts existing at the Effective Time, the Merger
will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, which breach
(i) cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the giving
of written notice to the breaching party of such breach and (ii) would entitle
the non-breaching party not to consummate the Transaction contemplated hereby

(c) _Delay_. By TriCo or FNBB in the event the Merger is not consummated by
September 30, 2018, except to the extent that the failure of the Merger to be
consummated by such date shall be due to (i) the failure of the party seeking
to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement or (ii) the
failure of any of the Shareholders (if FNBB is the party seeking to terminate)
to perform or observe their respective covenants and agreements under the
relevant Shareholder Agreement.

otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or an application therefor shall
have been permanently withdrawn at the formal or informal request of a
Governmental Entity, _provided, however,_ that no party shall have the right

been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at the
TriCo Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, _provided,
however_ , that no party may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.01(e) if such party has breached in any material respect any of its
obligations under this Agreement, in each case in a manner that caused the
failure to obtain the requisite approval of the shareholders of FNBB at the
FNBB Meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, or the requisite
approval of the shareholders of TriCo at the TriCo Meeting, or at any
adjournment or postponement thereof, as the case may be.

(i)  _By FNBB_. Provided that FNBB is not then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, including
without limitation Sections 6.02 and 6.07, by FNBB, by action of the FNBB
Board, by written notice to TriCo on the Business Day immediately following
the Determination Date, effective as of the date that is three (3) Business
Days following the date of such written notice, in the event that:

 

(A) the TriCo Average Closing Price is less than $33.18 per share (with a
proportionate adjustment in the event that outstanding shares of TriCo Common
Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any
stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or similar transaction between the date of this Agreement
and the Determination Date); and

(B) the quotient of the TriCo Average Closing Price divided by the Initial

Business Days following TriCos receipt of such notice, TriCo may elect by
written notice to FNBB to reinstate the Transaction as contemplated by

this Agreement and the Determination Date); and

Business Days following FNBBs receipt of such notice, FNBB may elect by

8.02 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , no party to this Agreement shall
have any liability or further obligation to any other party hereunder except
that (i) this Section 8.02, Section 6.06(d) and _Article IX_ shall survive any
termination of this Agreement and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, neither TriCo nor FNBB shall be relieved or released from any
liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or willful breach of any
provision of this Agreement.

 

(b) The parties hereto agree that FNBB shall pay TriCo the sum of $12.0
million (the " _Termination Fee_ ") as follows:

 

(i) if this Agreement is terminated by TriCo pursuant to Section 8.01(f)
(Failure to Recommend, etc.), FNBB shall pay the Termination Fee to TriCo on
the second (2nd) Business Day following the termination of this Agreement;

 

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by FNBB pursuant to Section 8.01(h)
(Superior Proposal), FNBB shall pay the Termination Fee to TriCo on the date
of the termination of this Agreement; or

 



-70- (iii) if this Agreement is terminated by (A) TriCo pursuant to Section
8.01(b) (Breach), or (B) by either TriCo or FNBB pursuant to Section 8.01(c)
(Delay) and at the time of such termination no vote of the FNBB shareholders
contemplated by this Agreement at the FNBB Meeting shall have occurred, or (C)
by TriCo or FNBB pursuant to Section 8.01(e)(i) (No Shareholder Approval),
and in the case of any termination pursuant to clause (A), (B) or (C), an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced and communicated or
made known to the executive officers of FNBB or the FNBB Board (or any Person
shall have publicly announced and communicated or made known an intention,
whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal, or reiterated a
previously expressed plan or intention to make an Acquisition Proposal) at
any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the taking of the vote
of the shareholders of FNBB contemplated by this Agreement at the FNBB
Meeting, in the case of clause (C), or prior to the date of termination, in
the case of clause (A) or (B), then (1) if within twelve (12) months after
such termination FNBB enters into an agreement with respect to a Control
Transaction, then FNBB shall pay to TriCo the Termination Fee on the date
of execution of such agreement and (2) if a Control Transaction is
consummated otherwise than pursuant to an agreement with FNBB within twelve
(12) months after such termination, then FNBB shall pay to TriCo the
Termination Fee on the date of such consummation of such Control Transaction.

As used in this Section 8.02(b), a " _Control Transaction_ " means (i) the
acquisition by any Person whether by purchase, merger, consolidation, sale,
transfer or otherwise, in one transaction or any series of transactions, of a
majority of the voting power of the outstanding securities of FNBB or
First National Bank or a majority of the assets of FNBB or First National
Bank, (ii) any issuance of securities resulting in the ownership by any Person
of more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the voting power of FNBB or by any
Person other than FNBB or First National Bank of more than ten percent (10%)
of the voting power of First National Bank or (iii) any merger, consolidation
or other business combination transaction involving FNBB or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result of which the shareholders of FNBB cease to own, in
the aggregate, at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of the
entity surviving or resulting from such transaction.

 

Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to this Section 8.02(b) shall be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
TriCo. Under no circumstances shall FNBB be obligated to pay the Termination
Fee on more than one occasion, and the parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that in the event the Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by
FNBB pursuant to this Section 8.02, the Termination Fee shall be TriCos sole
and exclusive remedy under this Agreement.

(c) FNBB and TriCo agree that the agreement contained in paragraph (b) above
is an integral part of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that
without such agreement TriCo would not have entered into this Agreement, and
that such amount does not constitute a penalty or liquidated damages in the
event of a breach of this Agreement by FNBB. If FNBB fails to pay TriCo the
amount due under paragraph (b) above within the time periods specified in such
paragraph (b), FNBB shall pay the costs and expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) incurred by TriCo in connection with any action,
including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amount,
provided TriCo prevails on the merits, together with interest on the amount
of any such unpaid amount at the prime lending rate prevailing during such
period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , calculated on a daily basis
from the date such amount was required to be paid until the date of
actual payment.

MISCELLANEOUS

9.01  _Survival_. No representations, warranties, agreements and covenants
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time (other than
agreements or covenants contained herein that by their express terms are to be
performed after the Effective Time) or the termination of this Agreement if
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time (other than Sections
6.06(d), 8.02 and this _Article IX_ , which shall survive any such
termination). Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, no
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be terminated or extinguished so as to deprive a
party hereto or any of its affiliates of any defense at law or in equity
which otherwise would be available against the claims of any Person, including
without limitation any shareholder or former shareholder.

 

9.02 _Waiver; Amendment_. Prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this
Agreement may be (i) waived, by the party benefited by the provision or (ii)
amended or modified at any time, by an agreement in writing among the parties
hereto executed in the same manner as this Agreement, provided that after the
approval of the principal terms of this Agreement by the FNBB shareholders,
no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by the
shareholders of FNBB without obtaining such approval, provided further that
after the approval of the principal terms of this Agreement by the TriCo
shareholders, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further
approval by the shareholders of TriCo without obtaining such approval. For
purposes of clarification, an amendment of any date in Section 8.01(c) shall
not require further approval by any shareholders and if such amendment were
deemed by law to require further approval by the shareholders of FNBB or
TriCo, the approval of the principal terms of this Agreement by such
shareholders will be deemed to have granted FNBB or TriCo, as the case may
be, the authority to amend such dates without such further approval.

9.03 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
original agreement.

9.04 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and interpreted in
accordance with, the laws of the State of California applicable to contracts
made and to be performed entirely within such State.

 

9.05 _Expenses_. Each party hereto will bear all expenses incurred by it in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, accountants and
counsel; _provided_ that nothing contained herein shall limit either partys
rights to recover any liabilities or damages arising out of the other partys
fraud or willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 



-72- 9.06 _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications hereunder to a
party shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if personally delivered,

Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements, and the
Confidentiality Agreements represent the entire understanding of the parties
hereto and thereto with reference to the Transaction, and this Agreement, the
Agreement of Merger, the Bank Merger Agreement, the Shareholder Agreements,

written agreements heretofore made. Except for the Indemnified Parties rights
with to Section 6.10, which are expressly intended to be for benefit of each
Indemnified Party, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person, other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under
or by reason of this Agreement.

 



-73- 9.08 _Severability_. Except to the extent that application of this Section
9.08 would have a Material Adverse Effect on FNBB or TriCo, any term or
provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or
affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable. In all such cases, the parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable
provision which, insofar as practicable, implements the original purposes and
intents of this Agreement.

9.09 _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Except as provided in Section 8.02(b), it is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. In the event attorneys fees or other costs
are incurred to secure performance of any of the obligations herein provided
for, or to establish damages for the breach thereof, or to obtain any other
appropriate relief, whether by way of prosecution or defense, the prevailing
party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees and costs
incurred therein.

 

9.10 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of, or Exhibit or
Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
are not part of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." Whenever the words "as of the date hereof" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to mean the day and year first
above written.

9.11 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

9.12 _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, TriCo may at any time modify the structure of the
acquisition of FNBB set forth herein, provided that (i) the Merger
Consideration to be paid to the holders of FNBB Common Stock is not thereby
changed in kind or reduced in amount as a result of such modification, (ii)
such modifications will not adversely affect the tax treatment to FNBBs
shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration and (iii) such
modification will not jeopardize receipt of any required approvals of
Governmental Entities or materially delay consummation of the Transaction

seek to advise or influence any Person with respect to the voting of, any
shares of FNBB Common Stock in connection with any vote or other action on
any matter of a type described in Section 1(b), other than to recommend that
shareholders of FNBB vote in favor of the adoption and approval of the Merger
Agreement and the Merger and as otherwise expressly permitted by this
Agreement. Shareholder agrees immediately to cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this

Acquisition Proposal and will take all necessary steps to inform any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other
representative retained by him, her or it of the obligations undertaken by
Shareholder pursuant to this Section 4\. Nothing contained in this Section 4

from discharging his or her fiduciary duties solely in his or her capacity as
such an officer or director.

 

5\. _Notice of Acquisitions; Proposals Regarding Prohibited Transactions._
Shareholder hereby agrees to notify TriCo promptly (and in any event within

FNBB Common Stock or other securities of FNBB of which Shareholder acquires
beneficial or record ownership on or after the date hereof. Shareholder

A-3 6\. _Non-Solicitation;  Non-Competition; Confidential Information_

(a) In connection with the disposition of all of Shareholders ownership
interest in FNBB Common Stock, Shareholder agrees that for a period of two (2)
years following the Closing Date, Shareholder will not directly or indirectly:

 

(i) solicit (other than general solicitations through newspapers or other
media of general circulation, or the engagement of professional search firms,
not targeted at such employees) any employees of FNBB or its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries (" _FNBB Employees_ "); _provided, however_ , that the foregoing
shall not apply to any FNBB Employee (Y) who does not become an employee of
TriCo or any of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date; or (Z) whose employment
terminated more than six months prior to the time that such FNBB Employee is
first solicited for employment following the Closing Date;

 

(ii) knowingly (A) induce, persuade, encourage or influence or attempt to
induce, persuade, encourage or influence any Person having a business
relationship with FNBB or its wholly-owned Subsidiaries and Affiliates prior
to the Closing Date, to discontinue, reduce or restrict such relationship
after the Closing Date or (B) solicit or target the deposits, loans or
other products and services from or to Persons who were depositors, borrowers
or customers of FNBB or its wholly-owned Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date,
whether by personal contact, by telephone, by facsimile, by mail or other form
of solicitation or communication, or in any other way except for general
solicitations that are directed to the general public and not directed
specifically to Persons who were depositors, borrowers or customers of FNBB or
its wholly-owned Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and for purposes of clarity, nothing herein shall prohibit
Shareholder from exercising Shareholders discretion relating to Shareholders
personal and business banking relationships; or

 

(iii) own, manage, operate, control, finance or participate in the ownership,
management, operation, control or financing of, or be connected as an
officer, director, employee, partner, principal, agent, representative,
consultant or otherwise with, any business or enterprise engaged in any
business that is competitive with or similar to FNBBs Business within any of
the California counties in which FNBB or its wholly-owned Subsidiaries does
business or maintains an office as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
above, Shareholder shall not be deemed to be engaged directly or indirectly in
any business in contravention of the immediately preceding sentence, if (a)
Shareholder participates in any such business solely (i) as an officer or
director of TriCo or Tri Counties or (ii) as a passive investor in up to 5% of
the equity securities or 10% of the debt securities of a company or
partnership, provided such securities are publicly traded or (b) Shareholder
is employed by a business or enterprise that is engaged primarily in a
business other than that which is competitive with or similar to the FNBBs
Business and Shareholder does not apply in any manner his or her expertise at
such business or enterprise to that part of such business or enterprise that
is competitive with or similar to FNBBs Business. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _FNBB s Business_" means and includes (i) the origination,
purchasing, selling and servicing of commercial, real estate, residential,
construction, agricultural and consumer loans and/or (ii) the solicitation
and provision of deposits, as conducted by FNBB and its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries, in either event as conducted by FNBB or its wholly-owned
subsidiaries as of the Closing Date[, provided this Section 6(a)(iii) shall
not apply if Shareholder continues to be employed as the Chief Financial
Officer of FNBB at the Effective Time of the Merger].1

 



   1  | This exception only applies to David A. Curtis, SVP, Chief
Financial Officer. 
---|--- 
 



A-4 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and at all times after
the date hereof, other than for the benefit of TriCo, FNBB or their
respective Subsidiaries, or as otherwise approved by TriCo, Shareholder (i)
shall make no use of the Confidential Information, or any other part thereof,
(ii) shall not disclose the Confidential Information, or any part thereof, to
any other Person, and (iii) shall deliver, on and after the Effective Time of
the Merger, upon the request of TriCo, all documents, reports, drawings,
designs, plans, proposals and other tangible evidence of Confidential
Information, now possessed or hereafter acquired by Shareholder, to TriCo. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Confidential Information_ " means all secrets
and other confidential information, trade secrets, ideas, knowledge, know-
how, techniques, secret processes, improvements, discoveries, methods,
inventions, sales, financial information, customers, lists of customers and
prospective customers, plans, concepts, strategies or products, as well as
all documents, reports, drawings, designs, plans and proposals otherwise
pertaining to same or relating to the business and properties of FNBB or its
Subsidiaries of which Shareholder has acquired, or may hereafter acquire,
knowledge and possession as a shareholder, director, officer or employee of
FNBB or its Subsidiaries or as a result of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, _provided however_ , notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, " _Confidential
Information_ " shall not include any (i) information which is or has become
available from a third party who learned the information independently and is
not or was not bound by a duty or agreement of confidentiality with respect
to such information; or (ii) information readily ascertainable from public,
trade or other nonconfidential sources (other than as a result, directly or
indirectly, of a disclosure or other dissemination in contravention of a
confidentiality agreement).

(c) Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the business conducted by FNBB
and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries is highly competitive and that the covenants
made by Shareholder in this Section 6 are made in connection with the
disposition of Shareholders entire ownership interest in FNBB Common Stock,
and are further made as a necessary inducement for TriCo to enter into the
Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. It
is the desire and intent of the parties to this Agreement that the provisions
of this Section 6 shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under
the laws and public policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement is
sought. It is expressly understood and agreed that although Shareholder and
TriCo each consider the restrictions contained in this Section 6 to be
reasonable, if a final determination is made by a court of competent
jurisdiction or an arbitrator that the time or territory or any other
restriction contained in this Section 6 is unenforceable against any party,
the provisions of this Section 6 shall be deemed amended to apply as to such
maximum time and territory and to such maximum extent as such court may
judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable.

 

(d) Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Agreement
are necessary to protect TriCos legitimate business interests and to protect
the value, including goodwill, of TriCos acquisition of FNBB. Shareholder
warrants that these provisions will not unreasonably interfere with his or her
ability to earn a living or to pursue his or her occupation and Shareholder
has the means to support himself or herself and his or her dependents and the
provisions of this Section 6 will not impair such ability in any manner
whatsoever.

 



A-5 (e) Shareholder will not, at any time during the two-year period referred to
in Subsection 6(a) of this Agreement, disparage TriCo, its Subsidiaries or any
of its Affiliates, or the business conducted by TriCo, its Subsidiaries or any
of their Affiliates, or any shareholder, member, director, manager, officer,
employee or agent of TriCo, its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates.

_7\. Specific Performance and Remedies._ Shareholder acknowledges that it
will be impossible to measure in money the damage to TriCo if Shareholder
fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement and that, in
the event of any such failure, TriCo will not have an adequate remedy at
law. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive relief or other
equitable remedy, in addition to remedies at law or in damages, is the
appropriate remedy for any such failure and will not oppose the granting of
such relief on the basis that TriCo may have an adequate remedy at law.
Shareholder agrees that he or she will not seek, and agrees to waive any
requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with TriCos
seeking or obtaining such equitable relief.

 

8\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_.

 

(a) The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof.

 

(b) This Agreement shall terminate upon the date, if any, of the termination
of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. Upon any such
termination, no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities
hereunder; _provided, however_ , such termination shall not relieve any party
from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, the provisions in
Sections 6(a) (other than Section 6(a)(iii)) and 6(e) shall survive for a
period of two (2) years from the date of termination (substituting the date
of termination for the term "Closing Date" in such sections) and the
provisions in Sections 3, 6(b) through 6(d), 7, 8 and 10 through 13 shall
survive indefinitely.

 

9\. _Stop Transfer Order._ In furtherance of this Agreement, Shareholder
hereby authorizes and instructs FNBB to enter a stop transfer order with
respect to all of Shareholders Shares for the period from the date hereof
through the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9,
except as otherwise provided for in Section 2(a) hereof. FNBB agrees that it
shall comply with such stop transfer instructions.

10\. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement supersedes all prior
agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended,
supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived,
except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No waiver of
any provisions hereof by any party shall be deemed a waiver of any other
provisions hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a
continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

 



A-6 11\. _Notices._ All notices, requests, claims, demands or other communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given when delivered
personally, upon receipt of a transmission confirmation if sent by telecopy or
