an amount equal to the Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock, plus
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time, if
any, remaining unpaid with respect to the Common Stock, represented by such certificate immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Until so surrendered, each such certificate (other than certificates

form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and
other taxes required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder
of the certificate or instrument surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Aviva

be closed and there shall not be any further registration or transfer of any shares of Common Stock
thereafter on the records of AmerUs. If, after the Effective Time, certificates for shares of
Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
cash as provided in Section&nbsp;2.1(a). No interest shall accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon
the surrender of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Common Stock.

that fact by the holder thereof, the Per Share Amount and any dividends or other distributions as
may be required pursuant to this Article&nbsp;II in respect of the shares of Common Stock represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Aviva may, in

necessary steps between the date hereof and the Effective Time to determine if any amounts should
be withheld or deducted from any payments made under this Agreement pursuant to the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (including all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
&#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;), or under any provision of any state, county, local or foreign tax Law, including
Section&nbsp;1445 of the Code. The Per Share Amount and the Award Consideration paid in the Merger
shall be subject to reduction for any applicable withholding Taxes or, as set forth in Section

different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up,
combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other securities
