a Contingent Payment, (B) any Escrow Distribution (if any) and (C) payment of
a positive Adjustment Amount (if any) pursuant to Section 1.10, in each case
subject to Section 1.9(e) or (ii) a distribution of funds from the

Entity (or any Affiliate thereof or successor thereto) or, if applicable, any
third party payroll services provider engaged by the Surviving Entity (or any
Affiliate thereof or successor thereto).

  



  

(d)  Any portion of the Parent Common Stock or amounts payable in
accordance with Sections 1.5 or 1.6 that is made available to the Payment
Agent in accordance with this Agreement and that remains undistributed by the
Payment Agent to holders of Company Securities as of the first anniversary of
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holder of
Company Securities who has not theretofore surrendered the documentation
contemplated under this Section 1.9 shall thereafter only look to Parent for
satisfaction of their claims for the cash amounts payable in accordance with
Sections 1.5 or 1.6.

  



  

(e)  Neither Parent, the Surviving Entity, the Payment Agent nor
any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any holder or former
holder of Company Securities with respect to any amounts properly delivered to
any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property Law or
escheat Law. If any Company Stock Certificates shall not have been exchanged
prior to the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing Date (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which the related consideration payable
pursuant to this Section 1 would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Body), any such consideration in respect thereof shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Entity, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f)  Each of Parent, the Surviving Entity, the Payment Agent and
their respective agents (each a " _Withholding Agent_ ") will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amount payable to any Person under this Agreement
or any other documents associated with the transaction, the amounts such
Withholding Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any
other applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the applicable Governmental Body, such withheld amounts will
be treated as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect of whom
such amounts were withheld.

(g)  Prior to the Effective Time, only with respect to the portion
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration with respect to the Employee Options
payable in shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent and the Company shall make a
determination as to the appropriate payment method for the shares of Parent
Common Stock.

  



  

(h)  If between the Execution Date and the Effective Time the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or securities or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend with a record date
within such period shall have been declared, then the payment under Sections
1.5 and 1.6 shall be equitably adjusted to provide the Participating
Securityholders the same economic effect as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event, and such items, so adjusted shall, from and
after the date of such event, be the payment under Sections 1.5 and 1.6.

  



  

(i)  Following the Effective Time no dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company
Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that the
holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender thereof until the
holder thereof shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate in accordance
with this Section 1.9. Promptly following the surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.9, there shall be paid to the
record holder thereof, without interest, the amount of any dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(j)  No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
and no certificates for any such fractional shares shall be issued to any
Participating Securityholder in connection with the Merger; _provided_ , that
in lieu of such fraction of a share, the holder of such Company Common Stock,
Company Preferred Stock or Company Options for which a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock would otherwise be payable hereunder shall be entitled to
an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by
multiplying such fraction by the Parent Stock Price as of the Closing Date.

  



  

(k)  In paying any consideration payable under Sections 1.5, 1.6,
1.9, 1.10 or 1.12, Parent shall be entitled to rely on any Closing Payment
Schedule or any applicable Future Payment Schedule. Notwithstanding anything
else to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the
aggregate consideration payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Entity
to the Participating Securityholders in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby exceed the sum of the Upfront Merger Consideration
Amount, any positive Adjustment Amount (if any), the aggregate amount of any
Escrow Distribution (if any), the positive Adjustment Amount (if any),
distribution of the Shareholders' Representative Reserve to the Participating
Securityholders (if any) and, to the extent earned pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, any applicable Contingent Payments.

  



  

   

-8-

 



    



  

(l)  If Parent provides written notice that it disputes in good
faith the accuracy of any Future Payment Schedule provided to Parent by the
Securityholders' Representative, which dispute may only be based on an
incorrect allocation of amounts described in such schedule among
Participating Securityholders, the Securityholders' Representative and Parent
shall engage in good faith discussions for 10 Business Days to resolve such
dispute. Whether or not Parent provides such a notice, Parent shall
deposit any future payment with the Payment Agent as and to the extent
otherwise required and on the same timelines required by the terms of this
Agreement and the Payment Agent Agreement shall provide that the Payment Agent
shall not release such payment to the Participating Securityholders until the
parties deliver a joint written instruction, which shall be delivered on the
later of (i) the date that such future payment is otherwise due under this
Agreement and (ii) five Business Days following the earlier of the
resolution of such dispute and the expiration of such 10 Business Day period.

  



  

(m)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,

  



  

(i)  with respect to Identified Investors: (A) in connection with
the Merger, each Identified Investor shall receive cash in lieu of shares of
Parent Common Stock in an amount equal to the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock otherwise to be received by such Identified Investor multiplied
by the Parent Stock Price, as determined on the Closing Date, and (B) to the
extent Parent elects to pay the $30,000,000 Milestone Payment corresponding
to the Completion of Enrollment for Phase 3 Clinical Trial for the Product
for PKU (the " _PKU Enrollment Milestone Payment_ ") in shares of Parent
Common Stock, then each Identified Investor shall receive cash in lieu of
shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the payment of such PKU
Enrollment Milestone Payment in an amount equal to the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock otherwise to be received by such Identified Investor
multiplied by the Parent Stock Price, as determined on the date the applicable
Milestone Event was achieved;

  



  

(ii)  with respect to Participating Securityholders that are not
Identified Investors, in connection with the Merger, each such Participating
Securityholder shall receive, on a pro rata basis, additional shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to a pro rata amount of the aggregate amount of cash to be
paid to the Identified Investors pursuant to the preceding clause (i)(A)
divided by the Parent Stock Price, as determined on the Closing Date; and

  



  

(iii)  with respect to Participating Securityholders who are
holders of Employee Options: (A) in respect of the amount of the
Upfront Merger Consideration attributable to Employee Options (but not shares
of Company Capital Stock owned by such holders), each such holder shall
receive 50% of such amount in cash and 50% of such amount in a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock valued at the Parent Stock Price, as determined
on the Closing Date, and (B) in respect the amount of the PKU Enrollment
Milestone Payment payable to such Participating Securityholder that is
attributable to Employee Options (but not shares of Company Capital Stock
owned by such holders), to the extent Parent elects to pay the PKU Enrollment
Milestone Payment in shares of Parent Common Stock, each such holder shall
receive 50% of such amount in cash and 50% of such amount in a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock valued at the Parent Stock Price, as determined
on the date the applicable Milestone Event was achieved.

The Closing Payment Schedule and any Contingent Payment Schedule prepared and
delivered in connection with payment of the PKU Enrollment Milestone Payment
shall reflect this Section 1.9(m).

  



  

(n)  All shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Section
1 shall bear a legend (and Parent will make a notation on its transfer books
to such effect) prominently stamped or printed thereon or the substance of
which will otherwise be reflected on the books and records of the transfer
agent for Parent Common Stock with respect to book-entry shares, in each case
reading substantially as follows:

  



  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.
THESE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND NOT WITH A VIEW TO
RESALE IN CONNECTION WITH A DISTRIBUTION AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR SUCH
SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAWS, OR AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER SUCH ACT."

(i)  Not less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a written schedule (the  "
_Estimated Net Assets Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the
Company's good faith estimate of the Closing Net Assets (the " _Estimated
Closing Net Assets_ "). The Estimated Net Assets Statement and all components
thereof shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis
consistent with the preparation of the Company's audited Financial Statements
for the most recently completed fiscal year and such Estimated Net Assets
Statement shall include such schedules and data with respect to the

purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, (B) be based on facts and circumstances
as they exist prior to Closing and shall exclude the effect of any act,
decision or event occurring on or after the Closing and (C) calculate any
reserves, accruals or other non-cash expense items on a pro rata (as opposed
to monthly accrual) basis to account for a Closing that occurs on any date
other than the last day of a calendar month. During the period beginning on
the date of delivery of the Estimated Net Assets Statement by the Company
until one Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall give
Parent an opportunity to provide comments on the Estimated Net Assets
Statement, shall work in good faith to resolve any differences the Company
and Parent may have with respect to any of the amounts or calculations set
forth in the Estimated Net Assets Statement, and, to the extent reasonably
requested by Parent, the Company will make available to Parent and its
representatives the work papers and other books and records used in preparing
the Estimated Closing Statement and afford Parent and its representatives
reasonable access to the relevant personnel and external representatives of
the Company to verify the accuracy of such amounts to the extent deemed
reasonably necessary by Parent.

(ii)  If, subject to the satisfaction of the last sentence of
Section 1.10(a)(i), the amount of the Estimated Closing Net Assets is
positive, one Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall be
permitted to make a cash distribution to its shareholders that shall not, in
aggregate, exceed the Estimated Closing Net Assets Surplus (after giving
effect to any Cash and Cash Equivalents to be used to pay Closing Date
Indebtedness or Closing Date Transaction Expenses).

  



  

(b)  Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Parent a written schedule (the  " _Estimated
Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail the Company's good
faith estimates of (i) the Closing Date Indebtedness (the " _Estimated

(the " _Estimated Closing Date Transaction Expenses_ "). The
Estimated Closing Statement and all components thereof shall be calculated in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of
the Company's audited Financial Statements for the most recently completed
fiscal year and such Estimated Closing Statement shall include, to the extent
reasonably requested by Parent, such schedules and data with respect to the
determinations set forth therein as may be appropriate to support the
calculations set forth therein. During the period beginning on the date of
delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement by the Company until the Closing
Date, the Company shall give Parent an opportunity to provide comments on the
Estimated Closing Statement, shall work in good faith to resolve any
differences the Company and Parent may have with respect to any of the
amounts or calculations set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, and, to
the extent reasonably requested by Parent, the Company will make available to
Parent and its representatives the work papers and other books and
records used in preparing the Estimated Closing Statement and afford Parent
and its representatives reasonable access to the relevant personnel and
external representatives of the Company to verify the accuracy of such amounts
to the extent deemed reasonably necessary by Parent.

(c)  Within 120 calendar days following the Closing, Parent shall
prepare and deliver to the Securityholders' Representative a written schedule
(the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail its
calculation of (i) the Closing Date Indebtedness, (ii) the Closing Date
Transaction Expenses and (iii) the Closing Net Assets. The Closing
Statement and all components thereof shall be calculated in accordance with
GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Company's
audited Financial Statements for the most recently-completed fiscal year and
such Closing Statement shall include such schedules and data with respect to
the determinations set forth therein as may be appropriate to support the
calculations set forth therein. Following the Closing, Parent shall provide
the Securityholders' Representative and its representatives reasonable
access, during regular business hours, in such a manner as to not interfere
with the normal operation of Parent or the Surviving Entity (subject to the
execution of customary work paper access letters, if requested), to work
papers and books and records and personnel relating to the preparation of the
Closing Statement solely for the purpose of assisting the
Securityholders' Representative in its review of the Closing Statement and
the calculations contained therein. If the Securityholders'
Representative disagrees with the calculations in the Closing Statement, the
Securityholders' Representative shall notify Parent of such disagreement in
writing (the " _Dispute Notice_ ") within 45 days after delivery of the
Closing Statement. The Dispute Notice must set forth in reasonable detail (A)
any item on the Closing Statement which the Securityholders' Representative
reasonably believes has not been prepared in accordance with this Agreement
and the Securityholders' Representative's determination of the amount of such
item and (B) the Securityholders' Representative's alternative calculation of
the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Closing Date Transaction Expenses and/or
the Closing Net Liabilities, as the case may be, together with all relevant
supporting documentation. Any item or amount that the Securityholders'
Representative does not dispute in the Dispute Notice within such 45-day
period shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In
the event any such Dispute Notice is timely provided, Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts for
a period of 30 days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculations included in the
Closing Statement that were disputed in the Dispute Notice. If, at the end of
such period, the Securityholders' Representative and Parent remain unable to
resolve the dispute in its entirety, then the unresolved items and amounts
thereof in dispute shall be submitted to a nationally recognized independent
accounting firm, reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative, which shall not be the independent accountants of, or provide
services to, Parent or the Company (the " _Dispute Auditor_ "). The Dispute
Auditor shall determine, based solely on the written presentations by the
Securityholders' Representative and Parent, and not by independent review,
only those items and amounts that remain then in dispute as set forth in the
Dispute Notice. In rendering its decision, the Dispute Auditor shall act as
an expert and not an arbiter and adhere to and be bound by the provisions of
this Section 1.10(c) and the applicable definitions set forth in this
Agreement. The Dispute Auditor's determination of the Closing Date
Indebtedness, the Closing Date Transaction Expenses and/or the Closing Net
Liabilities, as applicable, shall be made within 45 days after the dispute is
submitted for its determination and shall be set forth in a written statement
delivered to the Securityholders' Representative and Parent. A judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction selected pursuant to Section 10.5 hereof may
be entered upon the Dispute Auditor's determination. The Dispute Auditor
shall have exclusive jurisdiction over, and resorting to the Dispute Auditor
as provided in this Section 1.10(c) shall be the only recourse and remedy of
the parties against one another with respect to, those items and amounts that
remain in dispute under this Section 1.10(c); _provided_ , that this
provision shall not prohibit Parent or the Securityholders' Representative
from instituting litigation to enforce the determination of the Dispute
Auditor and shall not limit any remedy of any party under Section 8. The
Dispute Auditor shall allocate its fees and expenses between Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative (on behalf of the Participating
Securityholders) according to the degree to which the positions of the
respective parties are not accepted by the Dispute Auditor. The
Securityholders' Representative and Parent shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and representatives to, cooperate in good faith
with the Dispute Auditor, and shall give the Dispute Auditor access to all
data and other information it reasonably requests for purposes of such
resolution. In no event shall the decision of the Dispute Auditor assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
either Parent or the Securityholders' Representative or lesser than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Parent or the Securityholders'
Representative. Absent fraud or manifest error, any determinations made by
the Dispute Auditor pursuant to this Section 1.10(c) shall be final, non-
appealable and binding on the parties hereto, absent manifest error or fraud.

(d)  " _Adjustment Amount_ " shall mean the net amount, which may be
positive or negative, equal to: (i) (a) the Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness; _minus_ (b) the amount of Closing Date Indebtedness (as finally
determined in accordance with Section 1.10(c)); _plus_ (ii) (a) the Estimated
Closing Date Transaction Expenses; _minus_ (b) the amount of Closing Date
Transaction Expenses (as finally determined in accordance with Section
1.10(c)); _plus_ (iii) (a) the amount of Closing Net Assets (as finally
determined in accordance with Section 1.10(c)); _minus_ (b) the
Estimated Closing Net Assets. If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number,
then the Upfront Merger Consideration Amount shall be increased by the
Adjustment Amount. If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Upfront
Merger Consideration Amount shall be decreased by the Adjustment Amount. If
the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then (i) subject to Parent's
receipt of the Adjustment Payment Schedule, within five Business Days after
the final determination of the amount pursuant to Section 1.10(c), Parent
shall deposit the portion of the Adjustment Amount in cash due to the
Participating Securityholders (other than holders of Employee Options) with
the Payment Agent for further distribution to such Participating
Securityholders based on the applicable Per Share Adjustment Consideration
and (ii) after the final determination of the amount and subject to Parent's
receipt of the Adjustment Payment Schedule, Parent shall pay the portion of
the Adjustment Amount in cash due to the Participating Securityholders who
are holders of Employee Options (based on each such holder's Ownership
Percentage in respect of Employee Options) by the second payroll date
following such final determination through the standard payroll procedures of
the Surviving Entity (or any Affiliate thereof or successor thereto) or, if
applicable, any third party payroll services provider engaged by the
Surviving Entity (or any Affiliate thereof or successor thereto). In
furtherance of the foregoing payments, if the Adjustment Amount is a positive
number, the Securityholders' Representative shall, not later than five
Business Days after the final determination of such amount pursuant to
Section 1.10(c), deliver to Parent and the Payment Agent a payment schedule
(which need not be certified by an officer of the Company) (the " _Adjustment
Payment Schedule_ ") setting forth the portion of such Adjustment Amount
payable to each Participating Securityholder. If the Adjustment Amount is a
negative number, Parent shall be entitled to recover the absolute value of
such amount from (I) the Adjustment Escrow Funds and (ii) following exhaustion
of the Adjustment Escrow Funds, the Indemnity Escrow Funds, and, within five
Business Days after the final determination of such amount pursuant to
Section 1.10(c), the Securityholders' Representative and Parent shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Parent the absolute value of such amount
from the Adjustment Escrow Funds and/or the Indemnity Escrow Funds; it being
understood that, following the exhaustion of the Indemnity Escrow Funds,
Parent shall also be entitled to receive the absolute value of any balance
amount as an offset against payment of Contingent Payments to be paid pursuant
to Section 1.12 in accordance with Section 8.9. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (A) if (x) the Adjustment Amount is a positive number and is less
than $100,000, or (y) the Adjustment Amount is a negative number and the
absolute value of such Adjustment Amount is less than $100,000, then no
Adjustment Amount payments shall be made pursuant to this Section 1.10(d);
and (B) if the Adjustment Amount exceeds such $100,000 threshold in (x) or
(y), then only the amount of the Adjustment Amount that exceeds $100,000 shall
be payable in accordance with this Section 1.6.

(e)  On the Closing Date, (i) Parent shall cause the payment of the
Estimated Closing Date Transaction Expenses, if any, to the Persons
identified on the Estimated Closing Statement, (ii) Parent shall cause the
payment of the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, if any, to the Persons
identified on Part 1.10(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and (iii)
Parent shall deposit the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnity Escrow
Amount in segregated accounts (together, the " _Escrow Accounts_ ")
maintained by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The
Company shall deliver all applicable wire instructions for the payment of any
Estimated Closing Date Transaction Expenses or Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness to Parent at least two Business Days prior to the Closing.

  



  

(f)  The Estimated Closing Statement shall control solely for the
purposes of determining the payments to be made on the Closing Date pursuant
to Section 1.9 and shall not limit or otherwise affect Parent's remedies under
this Agreement or otherwise or constitute an acknowledgement by Parent of the
accuracy thereof.

  



  

1.11  Securityholders' Representative. 

  



  

(a)  In order to efficiently administer certain matters contemplated
hereby following the Closing, including any actions that the Securityholders'
Representative may, in its sole discretion, determine to be necessary,
desirable or appropriate in connection with the matters set forth in Sections
1.1, 1.10, 1.12 and 8, the Participating Securityholders, by the adoption of
this Agreement, acceptance of consideration under this Agreement and/or the
completion and execution of the Joinder Agreement, Letter of
Transmittal and/or Option Termination Agreement shall be deemed to have
designated Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the agent, attorney-in-
fact and representative of the Participating Securityholders (the "
_Securityholders ' Representative_") for all purposes in connection with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

(b)  The Securityholders' Representative may resign at any time. In
the event the Securityholders' Representative dies, becomes unable to perform
his, her or its responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, the
Participating Securityholders who hold at least a majority in interest of the
Ownership Percentages as of the Closing Date shall be authorized to and shall
select another representative to fill such vacancy and such substituted
representative shall be deemed to be the Securityholders' Representative for
all purposes of this Agreement and the documents delivered pursuant hereto.

  



  

(c)  By their adoption of this Agreement, acceptance of
consideration under this Agreement and/or the delivery of the
Written Consent, Joinder Agreement, Option Termination Agreement and/or
Letter of Transmittal, as applicable, the Participating Securityholders shall

(i)  the Securityholders' Representative shall be appointed and
constituted the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of each Participating
Securityholder, with full power in his, her or its name and on his, her or its
behalf to act according to the terms of this Agreement and in general to do
all things and to perform all acts including executing and delivering any
agreements, certificates, receipts, instructions, notices or instruments
contemplated by or deemed advisable in connection with this Agreement. The
Securityholders' Representative hereby accepts such appointment;

  



  

   

-14-

 



    



  

(ii)  the Securityholders' Representative shall have full
authority to, after the Closing (A) execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify
and file on behalf of the Participating Securityholders (in the name of any or
all of the Participating Securityholders or otherwise) any and all documents
that the Securityholders' Representative may, in its sole discretion,
determine to be necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and
containing such provisions as the Securityholders' Representative may, in its
sole discretion, determine to be appropriate, including the Escrow Agreement,
(B) do all things and to perform all acts, including amending the Ancillary
Agreements, waiving rights, discharging liabilities and obligations, making
all decisions relating to the determination of the Upfront Merger
Consideration Amount pursuant to Section 1.10 and the disbursement (if any)
of the Escrow Funds, Contingent Payments or any positive Adjustment Amount (or
any portion thereof) in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, as applicable, (C) give and receive notices and other
communications relating to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (except to the extent that this
Agreement contemplates that such notice or communication shall be given or
received by the Participating Securityholder individually), (D) take or
refrain from taking any actions (whether by negotiation, settlement,
litigation or otherwise) to resolve or settle all matters and disputes
arising out of or related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and (E) engage attorneys, accountants, financial and other
advisors, paying agents and other persons necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Securityholders' Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing;

  



  

(iii)  Parent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the
instructions and decisions given or made by the
Securityholders' Representative as to any of the matters described in this
Section 1.11, and no party or any Participating Securityholder shall have any
cause of action against Parent or its Affiliates for any action taken by
Parent or its Affiliates in reliance upon any such instructions or decisions;

  



  

(iv)  all actions, decisions and instructions of the
Securityholders' Representative, including any agreement between
the Securityholders' Representative and Parent relating to the determination
of the Upfront Merger Consideration Amount pursuant to Section 1.10 and the
disbursement of the Escrow Funds (or any portion thereof) in accordance with
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the determination or dispute of the
Contingent Payments or the defense or settlement of any claims for which the
Participating Securityholders may be required to indemnify the Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 8 hereof, shall be conclusive and
binding upon each of the Participating Securityholders, and no Participating
Securityholders shall have any cause of action against the Securityholders'
Representative and the Securityholders' Representative shall not be liable
for any action taken, decision made or instruction given by the
Securityholders' Representative under this Agreement, except for fraud, gross
negligence, or willful misconduct on the part of the Securityholders'
Representative;

  



  

(v)  the provisions of this Section 1.11 are independent and
severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest, and shall be
enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Participating
Securityholder may have in connection with the Transactions Contemplated by
this Agreement; and

  



  

   

-15-

 



    



  

(vi)  the provisions of this Section 1.11 shall be binding upon
the executors, heirs, legal representatives successors and assigns of each
Participating Securityholder, and any references in this Agreement to a
Participating Securityholder or the Participating Securityholders shall mean
and include the successors to the Participating Securityholders' rights
hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws of descent
and distribution or otherwise.

  



  

(d)  At the Closing, Parent shall cause to be deposited, in an
account designated by the Securityholders' Representative in writing at least
two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, $250,000 (the " _Securityholders
' Representative Reserve_"). In addition, 10% of each cash Milestone Payment
shall be deposited into the Securityholders' Representative Reserve (an "
_Additional Reserve Deposit_ "); provided, that in no event shall an
Additional Reserve Deposit increase the Securityholders' Representative
Reserve above $1,000,000 and in the event an Additional Reserve Deposit
would otherwise cause the Securityholders' Representative Reserve to exceed
$1,000,000 then the amount of such Additional Reserve Deposit shall be
reduced to the extent necessary to cause the Securityholders' Representative
Reserve to be $1,000,000 following such deposit. The Securityholders'
Representative Reserve may be applied as the Securityholders' Representative,
in his, her or its sole discretion, determines to be appropriate to defray,
offset, or pay any reasonable fees, costs, liabilities charges, losses,
fines, damages, claims, forfeitures, actions or expenses that the
Securityholders' Representative incurred in connection with the Transactions
Contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including in
connection with the matters contemplated by Sections 1.10 and 1.12 and the
evaluation or defense of any claim for indemnification under this
Agreement. For income U.S. federal and applicable state and local Tax
purposes, the Securityholders' Representative Reserve shall be treated as
having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Participating
Securityholders on the Closing Date in accordance with their Ownership
Percentages. The Participating Securityholders will not receive any interest
or earnings on the Securityholders' Representative Reserve and irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Securityholders' Representative any ownership right
that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The
Securityholders' Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal
of the Securityholders' Representative Reserve other than as a result of its
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Securityholders' Representative
will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use
these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes and
will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event
of bankruptcy. The balance of the Securityholders' Representative Reserve held
pursuant to this Section 1.11(d), if any, shall, at the sole discretion of
the Securityholders' Representative and at such time to be determined in the
sole discretion of the Securityholders' Representative, be deposited by the
Securityholders' Representative with the Payment Agent and distributed to the
Participating Securityholders according to each such Participating
Securityholder's Ownership Percentage. Prior to any such distribution of the
Securityholders' Representative Reserve, the Securityholders'
Representative shall deliver to Parent and the Payment Agent a payment
schedule (which need not be certified by an officer of the Company) (the "
_Representative Distribution Schedule_ ") setting forth the portion of the
Securityholders' Representative Reserve payable to each Participating
Securityholder.

  



  

   

-16-

 



    

   



  

(e)  As between the Participating Securityholders and the
Securityholders' Representative, the Securityholders' Representative shall
not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Securityholders'
Representative while acting in good faith, and any act done or omitted to be
done pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such
good faith. The Securityholders' Representative shall not be liable for any
action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The Participating
Securityholders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Securityholders'
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "
_Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the
Securityholders' Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement
and any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss
is suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Securityholders'
Representative, the Securityholders' Representative will reimburse
the Participating Securityholders the amount of such indemnified
Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Securityholders'
Representative by the Participating Securityholders, any such Representative
Losses may be recovered by the Securityholders' Representative from (i) the
funds in the Securityholders' Representative Reserve; (ii) the amounts in the
Escrow Funds at such time as remaining amounts would otherwise be
distributable to the Participating Securityholders; (iii) the Contingent
Payments, to the extent actually paid; and (iv) any other funds that become
payable to the Participating Securityholders under this Agreement at such time
as such amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Participating
Securityholders; provided, that while this section allows the Securityholders'
Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of funds, this does
not relieve the Participating Securityholders from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Securityholders' Representative from seeking any
remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will the
Securityholders' Representative be required to advance its own funds on
behalf of the Participating Securityholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations
on liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the
recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Participating
Securityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be
applicable to the indemnities provided to the Securityholders' Representative
under this section. The foregoing indemnities will survive the Closing, the
resignation or removal of the Securityholders' Representative or the
termination of this Agreement.

  



  

1.12  Contingent Consideration. Subject to Section 8.9, the
Participating Securityholders shall be entitled to certain contingent cash
payments determined as set forth below:

(a)   _Milestone Payments_. Within [***] days after the
achievement of the milestone event in part A, part B or part C of the table
below, and within [***] days after the end of the Calendar Quarter in which
each milestone event in part D of the table below is first achieved (each
such milestone event, a " _Milestone Event_ "), Parent shall notify the
Securityholders' Representative that such Milestone Event has been achieved
(each such notice, a " _Milestone Notice_ "). Parent shall, within ten (10)
Business Days following the delivery of a Milestone Notice, pay, or cause to
be paid, the payment corresponding to the applicable Milestone Event (each, a
" _Milestone Payment_ _,_ " and, collectively, the " _Milestone Payments_ "),
subject to Sections 1.10(d) and 8.9, to the Participating Securityholders by
depositing, or causing to be deposited, with (x) the Payment Agent, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as may be
designated by the Payment Agent, the portion of such Milestone Payment payable
to the Participating Securityholders (other than the holders of Employee
Options) and (y) the payroll account of the Surviving Entity (or any Affiliate
thereof or successor thereto) or, if applicable, of any third party payroll
services provider engaged by the Surviving Entity (or any Affiliate
thereof or successor thereto), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such bank account as may be designated by the Surviving Entity, the
portion of such Milestone Payment payable to the holders of Employee Options,
in each case, for further distribution to the applicable Participating
Securityholders in accordance with the Contingent Payment Schedule and
Sections 1.5, 1.6 and 1.9. All payments to be made by Parent under this
Section 1.12 shall be made in U.S. dollars and shall be paid by wire transfer
in immediately available funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that the PKU Enrollment Milestone Payment is payable, Parent shall have the
option, at its sole discretion, to pay such PKU Enrollment Milestone Payment
in cash or shares of Parent Common Stock. If Parent elects to pay such PKU
Enrollment Milestone Payment in shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent shall
deposit with the Payment Agent the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the amount of such PKU Enrollment Milestone Payment _divided by_
 the Parent Stock Price, as determined on the date the applicable Milestone
Event was achieved, for further distribution to the applicable Participating
Securityholders in accordance with the Contingent Payment Schedule and
Sections 1.5, 1.6 and 1.9. Each of the Milestone Payments shall be payable
one time only, for the first achievement of the corresponding Milestone Event,
regardless of how many times such Milestone Event is achieved.

(b)   _Net Sales Payments._ Within [***] days after the end of
each Calendar Quarter in which a Net Sales Payment pursuant to this Section
1.2(b) accrues, Parent shall notify the Securityholders' Representative (each
such notice, a " _Net Sales Notice_ "), which Net Sales Notice shall include
the applicable threshold of Annual Net Sales of Product in (A), (B) or (C) of
the table below that was achieved in such Calendar Quarter and cumulatively
for such Calendar Year through the date of such Net Sales Notice
(collectively, the " _Net Sales Thresholds_ "). Parent shall, within ten (10)
Business Days following delivery of a Net Sales Notice, pay, or cause to be
paid, the payment corresponding to the applicable Net Sales Threshold,
calculated using the applicable percentage of Annual Net Sales of Product set
forth in the table below (the " _Applicable Percentage_ ") applicable to each
Net Sales Threshold (each, a " _Net Sales Payment_ ," and, collectively, the
" _Net Sales Payments_ "), subject to Sections 1.10(d) and 8.9, to the
Participating Securityholders by depositing, or causing to be deposited, with
(x) the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such bank account as may be designated by the Payment Agent, the portion of
such Net Sales Payment payable to the Participating Securityholders (other
than the holders of Employee Options) and (y) the payroll account of the
Surviving Entity (or any Affiliate thereof or successor thereto) or, if
applicable, of any third party payroll services provider engaged by the
Surviving Entity (or any Affiliate thereof or successor thereto), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as may be
designated by the Surviving Entity, the portion of such Net Sales Payment
payable to the holders of Employee Options, in each case, for further
distribution to the applicable Participating Securityholders in accordance
with the Contingent Payment Schedule and Sections 1.5, 1.6 and 1.9. Net Sales
Payments in respect of Annual Net Sales of Product shall exclude Net Sales of
each Product in any country for which the Payment Term for such Product in
such country has expired and shall be calculated in accordance with the table
and clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) below. Parent shall have no
obligation to pay any Net Sales Payment with respect to Net Sales of any
Product in any country after the Payment Term for such Product in such country
has expired.

(i)  In the event that in any country or other jurisdiction
during the Payment Term for a Product there is Loss of Market Exclusivity for
such Product in such country or other jurisdiction, then the Applicable
Percentage set forth above with respect to such Product shall be reduced to
[***] of the Applicable Percentages set forth above for so long as the Loss of
Market Exclusivity continues for the applicable Product in such country.

  



  

(ii)  In the event that (A) Parent or any other Contingent
Payment Obligor (1) in its good faith judgment reasonably believes that it is
necessary to obtain a license from any Third Party under any Patent or other
intellectual property right owned or controlled by such Third Party in
connection with the development, manufacture, use, sale or exploitation of the
Company Compound or the Product in a country or other jurisdiction in the
Territory and (2) enters into an agreement with such Third Party in order to
obtain a license or right under such Patent or other intellectual property
right to develop, manufacture, use, sell or otherwise exploit the Company
Compound or the Product in such country or other jurisdiction, or (B) any
Governmental Body mandates Parent or any other Contingent Payment Obligor to
make any payment to such Third Party in connection with the development,
manufacture, use, sale or exploitation of the Company Compound or the Product
in a country or other jurisdiction in the Territory (a " _Government-
Mandated Paymen_ t"), Parent shall be entitled to deduct from any Net Sales
Payments payable hereunder with respect to that country or other jurisdiction
[***] of (y) the amount of all upfront payments, milestone payments,
royalties, and other amounts paid by Parent or such Contingent Payment
Obligor to such Third Party for such license or (z) the amount of any
Government-Mandated Payment, as the case may be.

  



  

(iii)  In the event that a court or a Governmental Body of
competent jurisdiction requires Parent, or any other Contingent
Payment Obligor to grant a compulsory license to a Third Party permitting
such Third Party to make and sell a Product in a country or
other jurisdiction, then, (A) Parent or such other Contingent Payment Obligor
shall provide prompt written notice to the Securityholders' Representative
and (B) for the purposes of calculating the Net Sales Payments payable with
respect to such Product, the Applicable Percentage shall be the lesser of the

(v)  In no event shall the reductions or offsets described in
Sections 1.12(b)(i), 1.12(b)(ii), 1.12(b)(iii) and 1.12 (b)(iv), alone or

Voucher; or (ii) [***] after the date that Parent or other Contingent Payment
Obligor receives proceeds of the sale of such Priority Review Voucher by
Parent or any other Contingent Payment Obligor to a Third Party, Parent or
such other Contingent Payment Obligor, as applicable, shall pay to the Payment
Agent or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, for the benefit of the
Participating Securityholders, either (A) an amount equal to $[***], in the
event that Parent or other Contingent Payment Obligor has not entered into an
agreement to sell such Priority Review Voucher on or before the date that is
[***] after receipt of such Priority Review Voucher, or (B) if Parent or
other Contingent Payment Obligor has entered into an agreement to sell such
Priority Review Voucher on or before the date that is [***] after receipt of
such Priority Review Voucher, an amount equal to [***]of the amount that
Parent or other Contingent Payment Obligor actually receives for the sale of
such Priority Review Voucher. The payment under this subsection (c) shall be
made for each Priority Review Voucher for Product that is obtained by
Parent or other Contingent Payment Obligor (each such payment a " _Voucher
Payment_ ") by depositing, or causing to be deposited, with (i) the Payment
Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as
may be designated by the Payment Agent, the portion of such Voucher Payment

[***] of such Sublicense Fees (each such payment a " _Sublicense Fee Payment_
" and together with the Milestone Payments, Net Sales Payments and Voucher
Payments, the " _Contingent Payments_ ") by depositing, or causing to be

such Sublicense Fee Payment payable to the holders of Employee Options (based
on each such holder's Ownership Percentage in respect of Employee Options),
in each case, for further distribution to the applicable Participating
Securityholders in accordance with the Contingent Payment Schedule and
Sections 1.5, 1.6 and 1.9.

  



  

(e)   _Records; Update Report; Audit Rights_. Parent and each
Contingent Payment Obligor shall keep complete, true and accurate books of

this Section 1.12. Such books and records shall be kept at the principal
place of business of Parent pursuant to Parent's accounting practices.
Commencing on the end of the first Calendar Year following the Closing Date
and continuing for so long as any Contingent Payments may become
payable, Parent shall, and shall cause each applicable Affiliate and each
Contingent Payment Obligor to, provide, on a semi-annual basis (within 30
days following the expiration of each 6-month period), a written report to the
Securityholders' Representative which shall (i) describe in reasonable detail
the status of activities relating to the Milestone Events (each such report,
an " _Update Report_ "); and (ii) within 20 days after delivery of an Update
Report, if the Securityholders' Representative requests a meeting with
representatives of Parent (or other Contingent Payment Obligor, as applicable)
or any of Parent's (or other Contingent Payment Obligor's, as applicable)
applicable Affiliates to discuss such report, Parent or other
Contingent Payment Obligor, as applicable, shall make available for such
meeting at least one employee with operating management responsibility for
the activities of Parent or other Contingent Payment Obligor, as applicable,
or any such Affiliate related to the achievement of the applicable Milestone
Event. The Securityholders' Representative may not request more than one such
meeting for any Update Report. Once in each 12-month period, the
Securityholders' Representative shall have the right, using a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm, to review such records of
Parent or Parent's applicable Affiliates as are reasonably necessary to
validate the accuracy of an Update Report and/or to verify the accuracy of the
payments due or paid hereunder for any Calendar Year. All information
contained in any Update Report, or conveyed to the Securityholders'
Representative or its independent accounting firm in any meeting or other
communication regarding an Update Report, shall be subject to a
confidentiality agreement between the applicable Contingent Payment Obligors
and the Securityholders' Representative. The results of each review, if any,
shall be binding on the Securityholders' Representative and Parent or other
Contingent Payment Obligor, as applicable, absent manifest error. If such
results show any underpayment, Parent or other Contingent Payment Obligor, as
applicable, will remit to the Payment Agent for further distribution to the
Participating Securityholders, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of
such report, (i) the amount of such underpayment and (ii) if such underpayment
exceeds seven percent (7%) of the total amount owed for the period then being
reviewed, the reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in conducting such
review. If such report shows any overpayment, such overpayment will be
deducted from future payments owed by Parent or other Contingent
Payment Obligor, as applicable, to the Participating Securityholders under
this Agreement.

Entity nor any other Affiliates of Parent (nor any other Contingent Payment
Obligors) shall have any obligation to own, operate, use, license, develop or
otherwise commercialize the Product in order to maximize or expedite the
achievement of any Milestone Event or the payment of any Contingent Payment.
The Securityholders' Representative (on behalf of the Participating
Securityholders) hereby acknowledges and agrees that (A) there is no
assurance that the Participating Securityholders will receive any
Contingent Payment, (B) neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity nor any other
Affiliates of Parent (nor any other Contingent Payment Obligors) promised or

Affiliates with respect to the likelihood of development or potential
sales of the Product, (C) neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity nor any
other Affiliates of Parent (nor any other Contingent Payment Obligors) owe
any fiduciary duty to the Securityholders' Representative or the Participating
Securityholders, and (D) the parties intend the express provisions of this

a condition to such transfer, deliver to Parent and the Surviving Entity a
written instrument confirming that such transferee shall be bound by all of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement or (E) without consideration in
connection with the dissolution, liquidation or termination of any
corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other entity and (iii)
does not represent any right other than the right to receive the Contingent
Payments pursuant to this Agreement. Any attempted transfer of the right to
any amounts with respect to any such payment by any holder thereof (other
than as specifically permitted by the immediately preceding sentence) shall
be null and void.

2.9 Intellectual Property. 

  



  

(a)  Part 2.9(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
identifies: (x) each item of Company Registered IP; (y) the jurisdiction in
which such item of Company Registered IP has been registered or filed and the

Company has the right to use such Company Registered IP, and (ii) if any
such Person has a joint ownership interest in such Company Registered IP, any
corresponding agreement(s) relating to such joint ownership. Each of the
Patents included in the Company Registered IP that is listed or required to be
listed as solely owned by any Acquired Company, and to the Company's
Knowledge each of the jointly owned and other Patents included in the Company
Registered IP, properly identifies by name each and every inventor of the
claims thereof as determined in accordance with United States patent law. The
Acquired Companies have complied in all material respects with all of their
obligations and duties to the respective patent offices, including the duty
of candor and disclosure to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and all
applicable Laws, with respect to all Company Registered IP. The Company has
no Knowledge of any information, facts or circumstances that would reasonably
be expected to result in any challenge to, or otherwise adversely impact, in
any material respect, the ownership, use, patentability, registrability,
enforceability or validity of any Company Registered IP, including any
Intellectual Property that is the subject matter thereof. The Company
Registered IP that is listed or required to be listed as owned by any Acquired
Company and, to the Company's Knowledge, the other Company Registered IP is
subsisting. All assignments of any Company Registered IP to any
Acquired Company have been properly executed and recorded. All issuance,
renewal, maintenance and other payments that are or have become due with
respect to any Company Registered IP have been timely paid by or on behalf of
the Acquired Companies, and there are no Liens on any of the Company
Registered IP other than non-exclusive licenses to end users entered into in
the ordinary course of business. To the Company's Knowledge, the issued
Patents included in the Company Registered IP are valid and enforceable. Part
2.9(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule describes each filing, payment,
and action that, to the Company's Knowledge, must be made or taken on or
before the date that is 120 days after the Execution Date in order to maintain
each such item of Company Registered IP that is listed or required to be
listed on Part 2.9(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and for which any
Acquired Company is responsible. No Registered IP that is listed or required
to be listed on Part 2.9(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule has been,
and no Acquired Company has received a notice that any Registered IP that is
listed or required to be listed on Part 2.9(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure

which the inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability of any such
Registered IP is being or has been contested or challenged, and to the
Company's Knowledge, no such proceeding has been threatened with respect to
any such Registered IP.

and enforceable title (free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted

that is listed or required to be listed as solely owned by an Acquired
Company. All Company Owned IP will be owned or available for use by Parent or
a Subsidiary of Parent following the Closing on the same terms and conditions
as it was immediately prior to the Closing. Together the Acquired
Companies own, and have good, valid, unexpired and enforceable title (free
and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances) to, all of the
joint right, title and interest in and to all Company Owned IP that is listed
or required to be listed as jointly-owned by one or more of the Acquired
Companies and any other Person(s), and have been granted an exclusive license,
from all other joint owners, to use and otherwise exploit, including to
practice, patent, register, prosecute, maintain and enforce, such Company
Owned IP pursuant and subject to a valid and enforceable written agreement
set forth in Part 2.9(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. One or more
of the Acquired Companies have been granted an exclusive license from all
owners of Company Owned IP in which the Acquired Companies neither has nor
purports to have an ownership interest, to use and otherwise exploit,
including to practice, patent, register, prosecute, maintain and enforce,

of the foregoing representations and warranties set forth above in this
Section 2.9(b)) that is used or held for use in the conduct of its business

Companies has any right of first refusal, option and/or other right to
acquire any right, title or interest in or to, or has any other Lien (other
than Permitted Encumbrances) with respect to, any Company Owned IP. In each
case where an Acquired Company has acquired ownership of Registered IP from
any other Person, such Acquired Company has obtained a valid and enforceable
assignment sufficient to irrevocably transfer all rights, title and interest
in and to such Registered IP to the Acquired Company, and the Acquired Company
has recorded each such assignment with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office and/or, where required by applicable Law, other applicable Governmental
Body. There is no Intellectual Property owned by any Third Party, and/or any
other Intellectual Property, other than the Company Intellectual Property (A)
that is required by the Acquired Companies, or is otherwise necessary, to
conduct its business as currently being conducted, and/or (B) that, to the
Company's Knowledge, is required by the Acquired Companies, or is otherwise
necessary, to conduct its business as currently proposed to be conducted with
respect to the Product and/or the Company Compound, including any Compound
Forms thereof (other than, with respect to each of clauses (A) and (B),
Intellectual Property owned by a Third Party that one or more Acquired
Companies have licensed or otherwise authorized to use pursuant to an Inbound
License listed in Part 2.9(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule).

(c) Neither the conduct of the business of any Acquired Company
nor the Acquired Companies (including through any consultant, employee or

upon or misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property
rights of any other Person, and, to the Company's Knowledge, the conduct of
its business as currently proposed to be conducted will not infringe upon,
misappropriate or otherwise violate the Intellectual Property rights of any
other Person. No Person has asserted any written action, proceeding or other
claim (or to the Company's Knowledge, any oral claim) and, no such proceeding
is pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened, (i) challenging any
Acquired Company's ownership or other right, interest or title in or to, or
the use, validity, enforceability, patentability or registrability of, any of
the Company Intellectual Property or any other Intellectual Property used or
held for use in the business of any Acquired Company by or on behalf of any
Acquired Company, (ii) alleging infringement or misappropriation or other
violation of any Intellectual Property rights by any Acquired Company,
including any demand to license Intellectual Property of any Third Party, or
(iii) involving any allegations that a current or former employee, officer,
director, consultant, contractor, service provider or advisor of any Acquired
Company (each, a " _Company Representative_ ") misappropriated, infringed or
otherwise violated any Intellectual Property rights of any Person that had
previously employed or otherwise engaged such Company Representative
(such Person, a " _Former Employer_ ") or breached any agreement with its
Former Employer in connection with such Company Representative's employment
by, or other engagement with, or that otherwise relates to, any Acquired
Company; and, to the Company's Knowledge, with respect to clause (i) (solely
with respect to Company Owned IP), clause (ii) and clause (iii) immediately
above, there is no reasonable basis for any such claim.

  



  

(d) None of the Acquired Companies has assumed, or agreed to
discharge or otherwise take responsibility for, any existing or
potential Liability of another Person for infringement, misappropriation or
other violation of any Intellectual Property rights and is not contractually

Company Registered IP or other Company Owned IP is subject to any pending or
outstanding consent, settlement, injunction, directive, order, judgment, or
other disposition of dispute that adversely impacts or restricts the use,
ownership, transfer, registration or licensing or other disposition of any
such Intellectual Property by any Acquired Company, or otherwise adversely
affects the validity, scope, use, registrability, or enforceability of any
Company Intellectual Property.

SECTION 5. Additional Covenants of the Parties. 

  



  

5.1 Section 280G. The Company shall, prior to the Closing (i)
secure from any Person who is a "disqualified individual", as defined in
Section 280G of the Code, of the Company or any parent or Subsidiary of the
Company and who has a right to any payments and/or benefits or potential
right to any payments and/or benefits in connection with the consummation of
the Merger (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events) that would be deemed to constitute "parachute
payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code, a binding written waiver of
such Person's rights to any such payments and/or benefits applicable to such
Person to the extent that all remaining payments and/or benefits applicable to
such Person shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" pursuant to
Section 280G of the Code (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") to the extent such
parachute payments are not subsequently approved pursuant to a stockholder
vote in accordance with the requirements of Sections 280G(b)(5)(A)(ii) and
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code (such vote the " _280G Stockholder Vote_ "); (ii)
submit for approval by the Company Stockholders the Waived 280G Benefits, to
the extent and in the manner that satisfies the requirements of the 280G
Stockholder Vote; and (iii) provide all required disclosure to all persons
entitled to vote under Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and hold a vote
of stockholders in the manner intended to satisfy the requirements of the
280G Stockholder Vote. The Company shall not pay any of the Waived 280G
Benefits if such payment is not approved by the Company Stockholders as
contemplated above. If applicable, prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent evidence satisfactory to Parent that a vote of
the Company Stockholders was received in conformance with Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations thereunder, or that such requisite stockholder
approval has not been obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits, and,
as a consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits have not been and shall not be
made or provided. No fewer than two (2) days before taking such actions, the
Company shall deliver to Parent for review and comment copies of any
documents or agreements necessary to effect this Section 5.1, including, but
not limited to, any stockholder consent form, disclosure statement, or
waiver, and the Company shall revise any such documents or agreements to take
into account any reasonable comments received from Parent on such documents or
agreements; _provided_  that Parent shall in no way be responsible for any of
the content of such disclosure except for information supplied in writing by
Parent expressly for inclusion therein.

5.2 Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts. 

  



  

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall give the other party
prompt notice of the commencement or known threat of commencement of
any Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body with respect to the
Merger or any of the other Transactions Contemplated by this Agreement, keep
the other party informed as to the status of any such Legal Proceeding or
threat, and each of the Company or Parent will permit authorized
representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting or conference
relating to any such Legal Proceeding, to participate in, or review, any
material communication before it is made to any Governmental Body, and to
have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or
proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with any
such Legal Proceeding, including by providing the other party with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any filing, submission,
response to an information request or other (oral or written) communication
and to consider in good faith the view of the other party to be submitted or
made to any Governmental Body and such receiving party shall consider any
such received comments in good faith. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Company will not, nor will it permit any of its representatives to
make any material communications with, or proposals relating to, or enter
into, any material understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any
Governmental Body relating to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
without Parent's prior review and approval. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, materials provided pursuant to this provision and
Section 5.2(a) may be (i) redacted (x) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the business of Acquired Companies and their Affiliates, (y) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (z) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and (ii) may be
restricted to outside counsel.

  



  

(b) Upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, each of the
parties (excluding the Securityholders' Representative) shall use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things, necessary, proper or advisable to make effective as promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than the End Date, the Merger and other
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and waivers with respect to (i) the
Contracts set forth on Part 2.23 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii)
any and all Contracts entered into by the Acquired Companies following the
Execution Date and prior to the Closing and (iii) all other Contracts as
reasonably requested by Parent, in each case, that are required to be obtained
from parties to such Contracts to which any Acquired Company is a party in
connection with the Transactions Contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
obligations of Parent shall not include any requirement of Parent to defend
any proceeding challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

5.3 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. 

  



  

(a) All rights to indemnification by the Company existing in
favor of those Persons who are current or former directors and officers
of the Acquired Companies (the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_") for their acts
and omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time as provided in the
Company Charter and the Company's bylaws or in another Acquired
Company's Organizational Documents (as in effect on the Execution Date) and
as provided in those indemnification agreements between the Acquired
Companies and such DandO Indemnified Persons (as in effect on the Execution
Date) listed in Schedule 5.3 and in the forms made available by the Company
to Parent as of the Execution Date (the " _Indemnification Agreements_ "), in
each case subject to the terms, conditions and limitations thereof, shall
survive the Merger and shall be observed by the Surviving Entity to the
fullest extent available under applicable Law, and any claim made requesting
indemnification pursuant to such indemnification rights shall continue to be
subject to this Section 5.3(a) and the indemnification rights provided under
this Section 5.3(a) until disposition of such claim.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase an
extended reporting period endorsement (the " _Tail D andO Policy_") under the
Company's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for
the Company's directors and officers on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent
that shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six
years following the Effective Time that provides at least the same coverage
in scope and amount as the existing coverage and have other terms not
materially less favorable in the aggregate to the insured persons than the
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
the Company and 100% of any premiums with respect to such Tail DandO Policy
shall be paid by the Company (and shall be deemed a Closing Date Transaction
Expense). After the Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause the
Surviving Entity to maintain such policy in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

  



  

(c) In the event that Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or Entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.3.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.3 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Persons and their
successors, assigns and heirs and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such DandO Indemnified Person may have by contract or otherwise. This Section
5.3 may not be amended, altered or repealed after the Effective Time without
the prior written consent of the affected DandO Indemnified Person.

  



  

5.4  Disclosure. No party shall issue any press release or
public announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without
the prior written approval of the other parties; provided, however, that (a)
the Company and the Securityholders' Representative acknowledge and agree
that Parent (i) may issue, without the approval of any other party, a press
release with respect to this Agreement and the matters contemplated hereby,
provided, that Parent shall provide a copy of such press release to the
Company prior to issuance and consider in good faith any comments of the
Company, (ii) intends to publicly file this Agreement with the SEC, and (iii)
intends to seek confidential treatment under applicable SEC rules with
respect to certain matters and terms contained in this Agreement; (b) Parent
or the Company may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is
required by applicable Law or stock market rule (in which case the disclosing
party shall use reasonable best efforts to advise the other party and provide
them with a copy of the proposed disclosure prior to making the disclosure);
and (c) Parent and its Affiliates shall not be bound by the provisions of
this Section 5.4 following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, following Closing and after the public
announcement of the Merger, the Securityholders' Representative shall be
permitted to publicly announce that it has been engaged to serve as the
Securityholders' Representative in connection herewith as long as such
announcement does not disclose any of the other terms hereof.

5.5 Tax Matters.

  



  

(a) The Company shall prepare and timely file, or shall cause
to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns that are required to
be filed by the Acquired Companies (taking into account any extension
properly obtained) on or before the Closing Date, and shall pay, or cause to
be paid, all Taxes of the Acquired Companies due on or before the Closing
Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax
Returns in a manner consistent with the past practices of the Acquired
Companies with respect to such items, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law.

  



  

(b) The Parent shall timely file or cause to be timely filed
when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax
Returns of the Acquired Companies for any taxable period ending prior to or
on the Closing Date that are filed after the Closing Date and for all
Straddle Periods (each, a " _Parent Prepared Return_ "). All Parent Prepared
Returns shall (i) be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past
practice of the applicable Acquired Company unless otherwise required
by applicable Law and (ii) to the extent any such Tax Return is a Tax Return
with respect to income or similar Taxes (an " _Income Tax Return_ "), include
all Transaction Deductions in the Tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. Parent with respect
to any Parent Prepared Return constitutes the " _Preparing Party_ " and the
Securityholders' Representative with respect to any Parent Prepared Return
constitutes the " _Non-Preparing Party_."

  



  

(i) The Preparing Party will submit each Parent Prepared Return to the
Non-Preparing Party for review and comment at least 60 days for any Income
Tax Return, and within a commercially reasonable amount of time for any non-
Income Tax Return, prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (or, if
such due date for an Income Tax Return is within 30 days following the Closing
Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, but in no case
less than five (5) days prior to such due date), and will consider in good
faith any reasonable comments received in writing within 30 days in the case
of any Income Tax Return, and as soon as reasonably practicable in the case
of any non-Income Tax Return, after the Preparing Party's delivery of such Tax
Return to the Non-Preparing Party (together with all reasonably related
calculations, schedules and supporting documents). For any such Parent
Prepared Returns, the parties shall try in good faith to resolve any
disagreements concerning such Tax Returns within 10 days following the
submission of comments by the Non-Preparing Party and shall submit any
unresolved dispute to a Tax partner at the Dispute Auditor (the "
_Tax Referee_ ") for prompt resolution following such 10-day period; and, if
any such contested Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date of such
Tax Return, the Preparing Party shall cause such contested Tax Return to be
executed and duly and timely filed with the appropriate Taxing Authority.
Following the resolution of such dispute with respect to a contested Tax
Return, the applicable Acquired Company shall amend and file such Tax Return
as necessary to reflect the resolution between the Preparing Party and the
Non-Preparing Party or by the Tax Referee, as applicable. The procedural
provisions of Section 1.10(c) of this Agreement concerning the Dispute
Auditor shall apply with appropriate adjustments to the resolution of any tax
disputes by the Tax Referee. To the extent any Taxes shown on any Parent
Prepared Returns prepared and finalized in accordance with this Section 5.5(b)
are subject to indemnification under Section 8.1 (but, for the avoidance of
doubt, (i) subject to the same limitations as otherwise applicable to any
indemnity for Pre-Closing Taxes under this Agreement, and (ii) without
duplications with any other provisions concerning indemnity for Pre-Closing
Taxes under this Agreement), Parent shall be entitled to reimbursement from
the Escrow Fund, in accordance with Section 8.7, no later than 2 Business
Days prior to the due date of such payment by the applicable Acquired Company
of such Taxes.

  



  

   

-66-

 



    



  

(ii) For all purposes of this Agreement, the amount of Indemnified
Flow-Through Taxes reflected on any Tax Return filed by Parent or any of its
U.S. Affiliates for a taxable year in which Parent or any of such Affiliates
is a United States shareholder, within the meaning of Section 951(b) of the
Code, on the last day of the taxable year of an Acquired Company that is not
organized in the United States (or any political subdivision thereof) (each,
an " _Acquired Foreign Company_ ") that includes the Closing Date (for U.S.
federal income tax purposes and associated state or local tax purposes) on
which such Acquired Foreign Company is a controlled foreign corporation,
within the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code (each, an "
_Indemnified Flow-Through Tax Return_ "), shall be deemed to be such amount
of Indemnified Flow-Through Taxes reflected on a "Pro Forma Indemnified Flow-
Through Tax Return" prepared and finalized pursuant to this Section
5.5(b)(ii). At least 60 days prior to the filing of any Indemnified Flow-
Through Tax Return, Parent will prepare and deliver or cause to be prepared
and delivered to the Securityholders' Representative a pro forma Tax Return
with respect to the Company and the Acquired Foreign Companies calculating
Indemnified Flow-Through Taxes as if the Company filed Income Tax Returns on a
separate, stand-alone basis after the Closing, and the Acquired Foreign
Companies were the only Subsidiaries of the Company classified as foreign
corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each, a " _Pro Forma
Indemnified Flow-Through Tax Return_ "), and will consider in good faith any
reasonable comments received in writing within 30 days of Parent's delivery of
such Pro Forma Indemnified Flow-Through Tax Return to the Securityholder's
Representative. Any disputes regarding a Pro Forma Indemnified Flow-
Through Tax Return shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 5.5(b)(i). To the extent any Taxes shown on any Pro Forma
Indemnified Flow-Through Tax Return prepared and finalized in accordance with
this Section 5.5(b)(ii) are subject to indemnification under Section 8.1
(but, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) subject to the same limitations as
otherwise applicable to any indemnity for Pre-Closing Taxes under this
Agreement, and (ii) without duplications with any other provisions
concerning indemnity for Pre-Closing Taxes under this Agreement), Parent
shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow Fund, in accordance with
Section 8.7, upon finalization of such Pro Forma Indemnified Flow-Through Tax
Return. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, neither the Securityholders' Representative nor any
holder of Company Securities shall have any access to any Tax information,
books and records prepared or filed with respect to any consolidated, combined
or unitary group of which Parent is the common parent.

  



  

   

-67-

 



    



  

(iii) For all purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Straddle
Period, (x) the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, receipts
or payroll of the Acquired Companies for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date and in the case of any Taxes attributable to the
ownership of any equity interest in any partnership or other "flowthrough"
entity or "controlled foreign corporation" (within the meaning of Section
957(a) of the Code or any comparable state, local or non-U.S. Law), as if the
taxable period of such partnership, other "flowthrough" entity or "controlled
foreign corporation" ended as of the end of the Closing Date), and (y) the
amount of other Taxes of the Acquired Companies that relate to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is number of
days in in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

  



  

(c) Parent will not (and will not permit any of its Affiliates,
including the Acquired Company) (i) file or amend any Tax Returns of
the Acquired Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, except,
for the avoidance of doubt (x) the filing of Parent Prepared Returns in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5.5(b), and (y) the amendment of any
such Tax Return as a result of a resolution of a Tax Claim managed in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5.5(d), (ii) make or change any Tax
election or change any method of accounting that has retroactive effect to
any Tax Return of the Acquired Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including any election pursuant to Section 338 or 336 of the Code), (iii)
initiate discussions or examinations or otherwise voluntarily approach (or
make voluntary disclosure of whatever kind to) any Tax authority regarding any
Tax or Tax Return of any Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including for the avoidance of doubt any Straddle Period) or (iv) agree to
extend or waive the statute of limitations with respect to Taxes of any
Acquired Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case except with the
prior written consent of the Securityholders' Representative (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

(d) If, subsequent to the Closing, Parent, the Acquired
Companies or any of their Affiliates receives notice any audit, litigation
or other proceeding with respect to Taxes of any Acquired Company (each a "
_Tax Claim_ ") regarding any Pre-Closing Tax Period or with respect to which
Participating Securityholders may otherwise be required to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, then within 10 Business Days after
receipt of such notice, the Parent shall notify the Securityholders'
Representative in writing of such notice (which notice shall include detailed
information including copies of any written materials received). No delay or
failure in so notifying the Securityholders' Representative shall relieve the
Participating Securityholders from any liability or obligation hereunder to
the extent they shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result
of such delay or failure.

  



  

   

-68-

 



    



  

(i) The Securityholders' Representative may elect to control the
conduct and resolution of such Tax Claim to the extent that such Tax Claim
relates solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Acquired Companies (a "
_Pre-Closing Tax Claim_ "), provided that (i) the Securityholders'
Representative shall permit Parent to participate in such Pre-Closing Tax
Claims (using counsel of its own choosing) at the sole cost and expense of
Parent, (ii) the Securityholders' Representative shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of all material developments on a timely basis with respect to any
such Pre-Closing Tax Claim, and (iii) the Securityholders' Representative
shall not enter into any settlement of, otherwise compromise or abandon any
Pre-Closing Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Parent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(ii) With respect to any Tax Claim (i) involving Tax matters or items
that could reasonably be expected to form the basis for a claim
of indemnification against the Securityholders' pursuant to this Agreement
and (ii) that the Securityholders' Representative does not or cannot elect to
control pursuant to Section 5.5(d)(i), Parent will control such Tax Claim,
including the defense and settlement thereof; provided that, (i) to the
extent the Securityholders' Representative cannot assume the control of
such Tax Claim because such Tax Claim covers one or more Pre-Closing Tax
Period as well as one or more Tax periods commencing after the Closing Date,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to separate the periods with
respect to which a Tax Claim apply to allow the Securityholders'
Representative to control a Pre-Closing Tax Claim, (ii) Parent shall permit
the Securityholders' Representative to participate in such Tax Claim (using
counsel of its own choosing) at the sole cost and expense of the
Participating Securityholders, (iii) Parent shall keep the Securityholders'
Representative reasonably informed of all material developments on a timely
basis with respect to any such Tax Claim, and (iv) Parent shall not enter into
any settlement of, otherwise compromise or abandon any such Tax Claim without
the prior written consent of the Securityholders' Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8.3, this
Section 5.5(d) and not Section 8.3 shall apply with respect to Tax Claims.

  



  

(e)  Parent, the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates, on the
one hand, and the Securityholders' Representative, on the other hand, shall
(i) cooperate in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns,
and any proceeding, investigation, audit or review by a Governmental Body
with respect to Taxes and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any certificate or other document from any Governmental Body as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and, upon Parent's or Securityholders' Representative's
request, the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant
to any such preparation, filing, proceeding, investigation, audit or review
and access to employees and outside counsel, advisors and accountants on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Parent and the Acquired Companies, on the
one hand, and the Securityholders' Representative, on the other hand, agree
to (to the extent applicable) (i) retain all books and records (in the case
of the Securityholders' Representative, to the extent in the Securityholders'
Representative's possession) with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Acquired Companies relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and to abide by
all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Body and
(ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to give the other party reasonable
written notice prior to destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if the other party so requests, Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records.

(f) Parent, on one hand, and the Participating
Securityholders, on the other hand, shall each bear 50% of all sales, use,
value added, transfer, stamp, registration, documentary, conveyance,
recording, excise, real property transfer or gains, or similar Taxes ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred as a result of the Transactions Contemplated by
this Agreement, and the Person(s) required to do so under applicable law
shall file all related Tax Returns, and the parties shall cooperate in
connection with any such filings. Neither party shall be liable to pay any
proportion of any additional Taxes, penalties, interest or similar costs
incurred by the delay, failure or defaults of the other party to comply with
its filing, registration and stamping obligations under this Section 5.5(f).

  



  

(g) Any refunds of Taxes (including for avoidance of doubt, for
all purposes of this Section 5.5(g), any credit received in lieu of
refunds of Taxes), including any interest received from a Governmental Body
thereon (net of any Taxes and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
with respect thereto), attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of any
Acquired Company (" _Tax Refunds_ ") shall be for the account of the
Securityholders, except to the extent such Tax Refund is attributable to (i)
the carry back of any net operating loss carry back, Tax credit or other Tax
attribute incurred in a taxable period (or portion thereof) commencing after
the Closing Date, (ii) a Tax Refund the amount of which was included in the
calculation of Closing Net Assets. The amount of any such Tax Refunds shall
be paid to the Payment Agent for further distribution to the
Participating Securityholders (other than holders of Employee Options in
respect of such Employee Options) within five (5) Business Days of receipt of
such Tax Refund (or the election to claim such credit in lieu of cash refund).
With respect to any Straddle Period, the principles of Section 5.5(b)(ii)
shall be applied in determining the extent any refunds are attributable to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period. All such Tax Refunds for which a cash refund could be
claimed shall be claimed as a cash refund rather than as a credit against
future Tax liabilities to the extent permissible. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if any Tax Refund with respect
to which Parent paid or caused to be paid an amount to the Payment Agent for
further distribution to the Participating Securityholders pursuant to this
Section 5.5(g) is subsequently disallowed, reduced or required to be
returned by the applicable Governmental Body, then amount equal to such
disallowed, reduced or required to be returned Tax refund or credit (together
with any interest, penalties or other amounts imposed by such Governmental
Body in connection therewith) shall be considered a Loss for Taxes of the
Parent Indemnified Parties subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.

  



  

(h) The parties to this Agreement agree that: (i) the Merger
shall be treated for federal and applicable state and local income Tax
purposes as a sale or exchange of the Company Capital Stock subject to
Section 1001 of the Code (or any corresponding provision under
applicable state or local Tax Law), and (ii) the contingent rights to receive
Contingent Payment shall be treated as deferred contingent purchase price
potentially eligible for installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the
Code and any corresponding provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law as
appropriate. No party to this Agreement shall file its Tax Returns in a manner
that is inconsistent with the Tax treatment specified above.

(a)  During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly

conditions to the obligations of Parent to consummate the Merger set forth in

received relating to any Acquisition Proposal, including in each case the
name of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and agrees to
keep Parent informed on a current basis of the status and details (including
any material amendments or proposed amendments of any such inquiry or

the Board of Directors of the Company shall adopt resolutions terminating,
effective no later than the day prior to the Closing Date, any Company Plan
which is intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code, and

Securityholders in connection with the payment of the PKU Enrollment

Notice with respect to the applicable Milestone Event but no later than 30
days after such date; provided, that in the event Parent is engaged in an
activity described in Section 5.11(c)(i) or (ii) below and Parent determines
that such activity makes it not practicable for Parent to file such
Registration Statement within such 30-day period, Parent may delay such
filing until it becomes practicable for Parent to file such
Registration Statement, but in any case no later than 90 days after such
date, in each case on a continuous or delayed basis pursuant to Rule 415
under the Securities Act, in respect of which Parent may use a registration
statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form registration statement available
for such resale which permits incorporation by reference of Parent's filings
with the SEC to at least the same extent as such form) to the extent Parent
is then eligible for its use (each, a " _Registration Statement_ "), and
cause such Registration Statement to become automatically effective upon
filing if eligible to do so or if not eligible to do so, then use
commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are necessary to cause
such Registration Statement to become effective. Parent shall cause all such
Parent Common Stock to be listed on NASDAQ so long as Parent Common Stock are

respect to the PKU Enrollment Milestone Payment, as applicable, or such
earlier time as all of the shares of Parent Common Stock covered by the
Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto; _provided_ , that the
obligation to keep such Registration Statement effective under this Section
5.11(b) shall not apply during the pendency of any Force Majeure Event to the
extent such Force Majeure Event is the reason for or cause of an inability to
keep such Registration Statement effective. Parent will promptly notify the
Securityholders' Representative of the time the Registration Statement became
effective or a supplement to any prospectus forming a part of the
Registration Statement has been filed.

(k) Parent may, by written notice to the Participating
Securityholders, suspend the use of the Registration Statement after
effectiveness and require that the Participating Securityholders immediately
cease sales of shares pursuant to the Registration Statement, in the event
that (i) Parent engages in a public offering of its securities (an " _Offering
Suspension_ ") or (ii) Parent is engaged in any activity, matter or
transaction or preparations or negotiations for any activity, matter or
transaction that Parent desires to keep confidential for business reasons, if
Parent determines in good faith, upon advice of counsel, that the public
disclosure requirements imposed on Parent under the Securities Act in
connection with the Registration Statement would require disclosure of such
activity, transaction, preparations or negotiations (a " _Confidentiality
Suspension_ "). Each Participating Securityholder agrees to keep and hold
confidential the fact of, and any information contained or referenced in, any
such notice described in this Section 5.11(c). Parent may suspend the use of
the Registration Statement by requiring Participating Securityholders to
cease sales of shares of Parent Common Stock upon notice to such Participating
Securityholders of an Offering Suspension or a Confidentiality Suspension,
provided that such suspensions, taken together, are not used more than three
times in the aggregate or for more than thirty (30) Business Days in the

(l)  If Parent suspends the use of the Registration Statement
by notice to the Participating Securityholders and requires the Participating
Securityholders to cease sales of shares pursuant to this Section 5.11, Parent
shall, as promptly as practicable following the termination of the
circumstance which entitled Parent to do so, take such actions as may be
necessary to reinstate the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and/or
give written notice to all Participating Securityholders authorizing them to
resume sales pursuant to the Registration Statement. If as a result thereof
the prospectus included in the Registration Statement has been amended to
comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, Parent shall enclose such
revised prospectus with the notice to Participating Securityholders given
pursuant to this Section 5.11(d), and the Participating Securityholders shall
make no offers or sales of shares pursuant to the Registration Statement
other than by means of such revised prospectus.

  



  

(m) Promptly following the filing by Parent of the Registration
Statement, Parent shall furnish to each Participating Securityholder a
copy of the prospectus, including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Parent shall promptly provide
the Participating Securityholders with revised or supplemented prospectuses
and, following receipt of the revised or supplemented prospectuses, the
Participating Securityholders shall be free to resume making offers and sales
under the Registration Statement. Parent shall pay the expenses incurred by
it in complying with its obligations under this Section 5.11, including
all registration and filing fees, exchange listing fees, fees and expenses of
counsel for Parent, and fees and expenses of accountants for Parent, but
excluding (i) any brokerage fees, selling commissions or underwriting spread
or discounts incurred by the Participating Securityholders in connection with
sales under the Registration Statement and (ii) the fees and expenses of any
counsel retained by or on behalf of the Participating Securityholders. Each
Participating Securityholder shall pay any expenses incurred by it in
connection with the performance of its obligations under or in compliance with

(n)  Parent shall not be required to include any shares of Parent
Common in the Registration Statement unless:

  



  

(i)  the Participating Securityholder owning such shares furnishes
to Parent in writing such information regarding such
Participating Securityholder and the proposed sale of Parent Common Stock by
such Participating Securityholder as Parent may reasonably request in writing
in connection with the Registration Statement or as shall be required in
connection therewith by the SEC or any state securities law authorities; and

  



  

(ii)  such Participating Securityholder shall have provided to Parent
its written agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to Parent) to (A)
indemnify Parent and each of its directors and officers against, and hold
Parent and each of its directors and officers harmless from, any losses,
claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including reasonable attorney's
fees) to which Parent or such directors and officers may become subject by
reason of any statement or omission in the Registration Statement made in
reliance upon, or in conformity with, a written statement by such
Participating Securityholder furnished pursuant to this Section 5.11, and (B)
report to Parent sales made pursuant to the Registration Statement, which
report may be made to Parent's transfer agent in connection with such sales.

  



  

(o)  Solely for purposes of Section 5.11, if any Parent Common Stock
is included in the Registration Statement under this Section 5.11, Parent
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Participating Securityholder whose
shares are included in the Registration Statement against any Losses, to
which such Participating Securityholder may become subject by reason of any
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement
or any omission to state therein a fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as
such losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities arise out of or are
based upon information furnished to Parent by or on behalf of the Company or a
Participating Securityholder for use in the Registration Statement. Parent
shall have the right to assume the defense and settlement of any claim or suit
for which Parent may be responsible for indemnification under this Section
5.11.

8.3  Third-Party Claims.

  



  

(a)  In the event Parent becomes aware of a third-party claim or
proceeding commenced by any Third Party that Parent reasonably believes may
result in an indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1 (any such claim, a "
_Third-Party Claim_ "), Parent shall promptly (and in any event within 10
Business Days after becoming aware of such claim) notify the
Securityholders' Representative in writing of such Third-Party Claim (such
notice, the " _Claim Notice_ "). The Claim Notice shall be accompanied by
copies of any relevant and material documentation submitted by the Third Party
making such Third-Party Claim and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the
extent known by Parent) the facts constituting the basis for such Third-
Party Claim and the amount of the claimed Losses; _provided, however_ , that
no delay or failure on the part of Parent in delivering a Claim Notice shall
relieve the Participating Securityholders from any liability hereunder except
and only to the extent they shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such delay or failure.

  



  

(b)  The Securityholders' Representative shall have the right to
conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing, the defense,
compromise or settlement of any Third-Party Claim against the Parent
Indemnified Parties as to which indemnification will be sought by any Parent
Indemnified Party from the Participating Securityholders hereunder, unless
such Third-Party Claim involves any Governmental Body (other than any such
Third Party Action involving Taxes), criminal action or a claim for
equitable relief (other than equitable relief that is ancillary to the
primary claim or claims and not material to the Parent Indemnified Party), in
which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party solely in connection therewith shall be considered Losses for purposes
of this Agreement. If the Securityholders' Representative does not, or is not
permitted under the terms hereof to, assume control of such defense, the
Parent Indemnified Party shall control such defense. In either case:

  



  

(i)  the party not controlling such defense may participate therein
at its own expense; _provided_ that if the Indemnifying Party assumes control
of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on
advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
have conflicting interests or different defenses available with respect to
such Third-Party Claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the
Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith shall be considered
Losses for purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Indemnifying Party be responsible for the fees and expenses
of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties;

  



  

(ii)  the party controlling such defense shall (A) use commercially
reasonable efforts to diligently defend against such Third-Party Claim, (B)
keep the other party reasonably informed of all material events related to
such Third-Party Claim and the defense thereof (including providing copies of
any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such
party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document
evidencing or asserting the same) and (C) consider in good faith the
recommendations made by the other party with respect thereto;

  



  

(iii)  the Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and

  



  

(iv)  the Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such
Third-Party Claim that does not include a complete release of the Indemnified
Party from all liability with respect thereto or that imposes any liability or
obligation on the Indemnified Party or has any other adverse effect on the
Indemnified Party and/or results in any injunctive relief against the
Indemnified Party, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,
that in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to indemnity
therefor hereunder if such consent is unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

8.4  Indemnification Mechanics. 

  



  

(a)  In order to seek indemnification under this Section 8, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (an "
_Indemnification Demand_ ") to the Securityholders' Representative (if the
Indemnified Party is Parent or the Surviving Entity) or Parent (if the
Indemnified Party is a Participating Securityholder) which contains (i) a
description and the amount of any Losses incurred or reasonably expected to
be incurred by the Indemnified Party (to the extent then known) and (ii) a
statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under
Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 for such Losses and a reasonable explanation of
the basis therefor.

  



  

   

-81-

 



    



  

(b)  Upon reasonable request, the Indemnified Party shall furnish the
Securityholders' Representative or Parent, as applicable, with any
information to the extent that such information is reasonably necessary in
order to evaluate the Indemnification Demand. If the Securityholders'
Representative or Parent, as applicable, in good faith objects to any claim
made by the Indemnified Party in the Indemnification Demand, then the
Securityholders' Representative or Parent, as applicable, shall deliver a
written notice (an " _Indemnification Dispute Notice_ ") to the Indemnified
Party within 30 calendar days following receipt by the Securityholders'
Representative or Parent, as applicable, of an Indemnification Demand from
such Indemnified Party. The Indemnification Dispute Notice shall set forth in
reasonable detail the principal basis for the dispute of any claim made by
the Indemnified Party in the Indemnification Demand (to the extent then
known). If the Securityholders' Representative or Parent, as applicable,
fails to deliver an Indemnification Dispute Notice prior to the expiration of
such 30-calendar day period, then the indemnity claim set forth in the
Indemnification Demand shall be conclusively determined in the Indemnified
Party's favor for purposes of this Section 8, and the Indemnified Party shall
be indemnified for the amount of the Losses stated in such Indemnification
Demand (or, in the case of any notice in which the Losses (or any portion
thereof) are estimated, the amount of such Losses (or such portion thereof)
as finally determined) on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the
Losses (or any portion thereof) are estimated, on such later date when the
amount of such Losses (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined,
in either case, subject to the limitations of this Section 8.

  



  

(c)  If the Securityholders' Representative or Parent, as applicable,
delivers an Indemnification Dispute Notice, then the Indemnified Party and
the Securityholders' Representative or Parent, as applicable, shall attempt in
good faith to resolve any such objections raised by the Securityholders'
Representative or Parent, as applicable, in such Indemnification
Dispute Notice. If the Indemnified Party and the Securityholders'
Representative or Parent, as applicable, agree to a resolution of such
objection, then a memorandum setting forth the matters conclusively determined
by the Indemnified Party and the Securityholders' Representative or Parent,
as applicable, shall be prepared and signed by both parties, and shall be
binding and conclusive upon the parties hereto.

  



  

(d)  If no such resolution can be reached during the 30-day period
following the Indemnified Party's receipt of a given Indemnification Dispute
Notice, then upon the expiration of such 30-day period (or such longer period
as may be mutually agreed), the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
pursue all remedies available to them under this Agreement with respect to
such claims (in each case subject to the terms and limitations set forth in
this Agreement).

  



  

8.5  Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and
remain in full force and effect and expire at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on
the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date (the " _Survival Date_ "); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) the Specified Representations and Tax
Representations shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect
until the day that is 60 days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations, (y) the representations and warranties in Section
2.17 ( _Employee Matters_ ) shall survive the Closing and remain in full force
and effect until the date that is 15 months after the Closing Date, and (z)
the representations and warranties in Section 2.9 (Intellectual Property)
(the " _IP Representations_ ") shall survive the Closing and remain in full
force and effect until the date that is three (3) years after the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that, with respect to any claim as to which an
Indemnified Party shall have, on or prior to such date, delivered an
Indemnification Demand, the indemnification obligations hereunder with
respect to the claim asserted in such Indemnification Demand, shall survive
until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved and payment in
respect thereof, if any is required to be made under the terms of this
Agreement, shall have been made. All covenants and agreements of the parties
contained in this Agreement (i) that are to be performed at or prior to the
Closing shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until
the date that is 15 months after the Closing Date and (ii) that are to be
performed following the Closing shall continue in effect and expire in
accordance with their respective terms. It is the express intent of the
parties that, if an applicable survival period as contemplated by this Section
8.5 is shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have been
applicable, then, by contract, the applicable statute of limitations shall be
reduced to the shortened survival period contemplated hereby. The parties
further acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this Section 8.5 for
the assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result of
arms'-length negotiation among the parties and that they intend for the time
periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties.

8.6  Limitations.

  



  

(a)  The Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive source of recovery
for indemnification claims under Section 8.1(a) (except (i) with respect to
such claims related to breaches or inaccuracies of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2.3 ( _Capitalization, Etc._ ) and 2.21 (
_Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement_ ), or (ii) in the case of common law
fraud) shall be recourse against the then remaining Indemnity Escrow Funds
held in the Escrow Account and, in the event the Indemnity Escrow Funds have
been exhausted, the right of set off in Section 8.9, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Section 8.6 and Section 8.9(c); _provided_
that, other than as provided in Section 8.6(d), in no event shall any
Participating Securityholder's aggregate liability to the Parent Indemnified
Parties for indemnification claims pursuant to this Section 8 exceed an amount
equal to the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration actually received
(or would have been received in the case of Contingent Payments) by such
Participating Securityholder hereunder (as calculated on the date of
determination and including, for purposes of this Section 8.6(a), (x) such
Participating Securityholder's Economic Percentage of amounts in the Escrow
Fund and Securityholders' Representative Reserve and (y) any Taxes withheld
in respect of such Participating Securityholder's Company Securities); 
_provided further_ that (A) the maximum aggregate liability of the
Participating Stockholders for indemnification claims under Section 8.1(a)
(except (1) with respect to such claims related to breaches or inaccuracies of
Specified Representations, the Tax Representations or IP Representations or
(2) in the case of common law fraud) shall be the then remaining Indemnity
Escrow Funds held in the Escrow Account and (B) the maximum aggregate
liability of the Participating Stockholders for indemnification claims under
Section 8.1 (except in the case of common law fraud), together with any
amounts deducted from Net Sales Payments under Section 1.12(b)(ii), shall in
no event exceed $100,000,000. The parties acknowledge that there shall not be
any duplicative recovery for any Losses arising from the same facts and
circumstances.

  



  

   

-83-

 



    



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, except as provided in Section 8.6(d), no Parent Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to recover any Losses under Section 8.1(a) unless and until
(i) the aggregate Losses with respect to the particular event or occurrence
giving rise to such claim (and all other events or occurrences arising from
the same or similar circumstances) exceed $10,000 (at which point the Parent
and the Surviving Entity shall become entitled to be indemnified for all such
Losses, subject to clause (ii) below and the other limitations set forth
herein) and (ii) the aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $350,000
(the " _Indemnity Deductible_ ") (at which point Parent and the Surviving
Entity shall become entitled to be indemnified only for all such Losses in
excess of $175,000); provided, however, that the Indemnity Deductible shall
not apply to any Losses related to the inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
Specified Representations or the Tax Representations.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or
elsewhere to the contrary, "material" and "Company Material Adverse Effect"
or similar materiality type qualifications contained in the representations
and warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be ignored
under this Section 8 (and not under any other section) solely for purposes of
determining whether there has been any breach of a representation or warranty
hereunder and the amount of any Losses; provided, that such terms shall not
be ignored in the representations and warranties set forth in the last
sentence of Section 2.5 or the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 2.11(a)(xvii), and for the avoidance of doubt this 8.6(c) is not
intended to modify the use or meaning of the terms "GAAP" or "Material
Contract" notwithstanding the fact that such terms may incorporate
materiality or similar concepts in their meanings.

  



  

(d)  The limitations set forth in (i) the first sentence of Section
8.6(a) and (ii) Section 8.6(b) shall not apply to or in any way limit the
Liability of any Person for such Person's act of common law fraud in the
making of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement.

  



  

8.7  Manner of Payment.

  



  

(a)  Any payment that the Participating Securityholders are
obligated to make to any Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section
8 shall be made, first, to the extent there are sufficient Indemnity Escrow
Funds, by distributing (i) first, an amount of cash equal to such Losses, and
to the extent that such Losses exceed the cash available, the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to such remaining Losses divided by the Parent
Stock Price, determined as of the Escrow Notice Date, in each case to the
Parent Indemnified Parties from the applicable Escrow Account by the Escrow
Agent within two Business Days after the date written notice of any sums due
and owing is delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
(the " _Escrow Notice Date_ "), and (ii) second, either (x) directly by the
Participating Securityholders in accordance with their respective Economic
Percentages (subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 8) or (y) in
accordance with Section 8.9 (subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 8).

  



  

   

-84-

 



    



   



  

(b) Within two Business Days following the Survival Date, the Escrow
Agent shall release the then remaining Indemnity Escrow Funds (to the extent
such funds have not been utilized to pay the Parent Indemnified Parties for
any indemnification claims under this Section 8) to (i) the Payment Agent for
further distribution to the Participating Securityholders (other than holders
of Employee Options in respect of such Employee Options) and (ii) the
Surviving Entity (or any successor thereto) for further distribution to the
Participating Securityholders in respect of Employee Options, in each case, in
accordance with Sections 1.5, 1.6 and 1.9(m), as applicable; provided,
however, that in the case of any Identified Investor or holder of Employee
Options (in respect of such holder's Employee Options), the shares of Parent
Common Stock otherwise distributable to such persons in accordance
with clauses (i) or (ii) above shall, to the extent required by Sections
1.9(m), be cancelled and in lieu of such shares of Parent Common Stock,
Parent shall substitute and pay an amount of cash to the Payment Agent in
respect of any Identified Investors or the Surviving Entity in respect of
holders of Employee Options, as applicable, equal to the value of such
cancelled shares at the Parent Stock Price as determined on the date of the
release of the Indemnity Escrow Funds; _provided_ that the Escrow Agent shall
retain (A) cash in an amount equal to the aggregate value of any claims for
indemnification asserted in good faith prior to the Survival Date in
accordance with the terms of Section 8.4(a) but which are not yet resolved
(including any claims for which the time period to deliver an Indemnification
Dispute Notice pursuant to Section 8.4(b) has not yet expired) (each such
claim, an " _Unresolved Claim_ "), and, to the extent that the aggregate
value of all Unresolved Claims exceeds the cash available, (B) a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to such remaining value of Unresolved
Claims divided by the Parent Stock Price, determined as of the Survival Date.
The amount of the Indemnity Escrow Funds retained for each Unresolved Claim
shall be released (to the extent such funds are not utilized to indemnify any
Parent Indemnified Party for such Unresolved Claim in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement) by the Escrow Agent to the Payment Agent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, in accordance with the prior sentence upon
the final and binding resolution of such Unresolved Claim in accordance with
this Section 8 and the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(c) Following the final determination and payment of the Adjustment
Amount to the Payment Agent or Parent, as the case may be, in accordance with
Section 1.10(d), all amounts, if any, remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Funds
shall be released by the Escrow Agent to (i) the Payment Agent for further
distribution to the Participating Securityholders (other than holders of
Employee Options in respect of such Employee Options) and (ii) the Surviving
Entity (or any successor thereto) for further distribution to the
Participating Securityholders in respect of Employee Options, in each case,
in accordance with Section 1.5 and Section 1.6, as applicable.

  



  

(d) Any amounts payable to the Participating Securityholders
pursuant to this Section 8.7 shall only be due and payable, subject to
Section 1.9(m) and the Escrow Agreement, (x) with respect to all Participating
Securityholders (other than with respect to Employee Options), to the Payment
Agent within five Business Days following delivery of the applicable Escrow
Distribution Schedule and (y) with respect to the Employee Options, to such
holders on or before the Surviving Entity's second payroll date
following delivery of the applicable Escrow Distribution Schedule.

  



  

   

-85-

 



    



  

(e) The Participating Securityholders intend for U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income Tax purposes that any disbursements of
Indemnity Escrow Funds to Participating Securityholders with respect to
Company Securities (other than Company Options) be treated as payments
pursuant to an "installment sale" within the meaning of Section 453(b) of the
Code, _provided_ , _however_ , that that the Participating Securityholders
shall treat a portion of such disbursements as interest to the extent required
by Section 483 or Section 1274 of the Code.

  



  

8.8 Subrogation; Tax Offset; Duty to Mitigate.

  



  

(a) If Parent, the Surviving Entity or any Affiliate of Parent or
the Surviving Entity receives or becomes entitled to indemnification from the
Participating Securityholders, the Securityholders' Representative (on behalf
of the Participating Securityholders) shall be entitled to exercise and shall
be subrogated to any rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity,
rights of contribution and rights of recovery) that Parent, the Surviving
Entity or such Affiliate may have against any other Person with respect to
any Losses, circumstance or matter to which such indemnification payment is
directly or indirectly related; provided, that the
Securityholders' Representative, in connection with its exercise of such
subrogation right, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent any
harm or Loss to the Surviving Entity's and its Affiliates' business and their
respective relationships with customers, vendors, suppliers, licensors and
licensees.

  



  

(b) The amount to which an Indemnified Party may become entitled
under this Section 8 shall be reduced by the net Tax savings or realized
benefits actually received in cash (or as a credit in lieu of cash) or through
the reduction in any cash payment for Taxes (or increase in the amount of
credits in lieu of Tax) arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence or
payment of any applicable Loss that is received (or deemed receive in the
case of a credit in lieu of cash) by such Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates in the taxable year in which such Loss is incurred, the two
subsequent years or any prior taxable year.

  



  

(c) Each Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that
gives rise to a claim for indemnification under this Agreement (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the expense of counsel in the defense of a Third-
Party Claim).

  



  

8.9 Right to Satisfy Indemnification Claims by Reducing Contingent
Payments. 

  



  

(a) Subject to Section 8.6 and Section 8.9(c), Parent is expressly
authorized, but shall not be obligated, to set off any Losses for which it is
entitled to indemnification hereunder (subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 8) or any negative Adjustment Amount finally determined pursuant to
Section 1.10 and which it was not able to recover from the Escrow Fund,
following final resolution of the claims set forth in any Indemnification
Demand pursuant to Section 8.4(a) or otherwise pursuant to a final non-
appealable order or judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, against any
Contingent Payment or any other payments to be made to the Participating
Securityholders (directly or indirectly through the Surviving Entity or the
Payment Agent) following the Closing.

  



  

   

-86-

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding Section 1.12 and subject to Section 8.6, if at
the time any Contingent Payment is due and payable there shall be any
outstanding Indemnification Demand delivered in accordance with Section
8.4(a), the amount of Losses with respect to which shall not have been
finally determined in accordance with this Section 8, then Parent shall be
entitled, but shall not be required, to withhold from such Contingent
Payment, the amount of Losses the Parent Indemnified Party reasonably
estimates to be subject to such Indemnification Demand. If the final amount
of Losses for such Indemnification Demand is determined in accordance with
this Section 8 to be less than the amount withheld from such Contingent
Payment, then Parent shall promptly, and in any event within five Business
Days following the final determination of the amount of such Losses, deliver
the difference to the Payment Agent for distribution to the Participating
Securityholders pursuant to Section 1.9 (other than the portion of such
amount due in respect of Employee Options, which shall be paid through the
standard payroll procedures of the Surviving Entity (or any Affiliate thereof
or successor thereto) or, if applicable, any third party payroll services
provider engaged by the Surviving Entity or any Affiliate thereof or
successor thereto). If the final amount of Losses for such Indemnification
Demand is determined in accordance with this Section 8 to exceed the amount
by which such Contingent Payment was reduced for such claim, then
Parent shall continue to be entitled to indemnification for the amount of
such excess subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 8.

  



  

(c) Except in the case of common law fraud, the maximum aggregate
amount of Losses that Parent may set off against or withhold from the PKU
Enrollment Milestone Payment shall be not more than 50% of such PKU Enrollment
Milestone Payment. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) other than the PKU
Enrollment Milestone Payment, Parent may, subject to the limitations set forth
in this Section 8, set off against or withhold from the full amount of any
other Contingent Payment under this Agreement and (ii) any portion of a
Contingent Payment not subject to such a set off in accordance with this
Section 8.9 shall be paid in accordance with the terms and deadlines
applicable to such Contingent Payment.

  



  

8.10 Tax Treatment of Payments. The parties hereto agree to treat any
payments made pursuant to this Section 8 as adjustments to the Merger
consideration for all U.S. federal, state and local income Tax purposes to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

  



  

8.11 Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, subject to Section 10.12, the
parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that the indemnity rights set
forth in this Section 8 shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy available to the Indemnified Parties, and such Indemnified Parties

(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Merger shall not have
been consummated by the End Date; _provided, however,_ that a party shall not
be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) if

perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)

forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured
within 30 calendar days following receipt by Parent of written notice of such
material breach or failure to perform; _provided _ that the Company may not

breach of this Agreement such that Parent has the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d) but for the proviso thereto.; or

Agreement as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect and no party hereto (or any of its Affiliates, directors,
trustees, executors, officers, agents or representatives) shall have any
liability or obligation hereunder; _provided, however,_ that (i) this Section

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or other
communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it
actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to this
Agreement may change the address to which notices and other communications
hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to this Agreement
notice in the manner herein set forth.

  



  

10.10  Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof
or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

10.12  Remedies.

  



  

(p) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one (1) remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy.

  



  

(q) Each of the parties hereto agrees that this Agreement is
intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable pursuant to its
terms and that Parent and the Company would be irreparably harmed if any of
the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms and that monetary damages would not provide adequate remedy in
such event. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy to which a non-
breaching party may be entitled at law, a non-breaching party shall be
entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof, in each case without
posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law
or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity.

including the Surviving Entity) irrevocably waives, consents to and covenants
not to assert any objection based on conflict of interest to any

Company also further agree that, as to all communications prior to the Closing

Payment Obligor.

active component contained in the Combination Product if sold separately in
such country.

sales as described above, then Net Sales will be calculated as above, but the
gross invoice price in the above equation will be determined in good faith
prior to the end of the accounting period in question based on an equitable
method of determining the same that takes into account, in the applicable
country, variations in dosage units and the relative fair market value of
each therapeutically active component in the Combination Product. As herein,
