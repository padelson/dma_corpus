for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

shall sell to Purchaser, all of each such SellerÂ’s right, title and interest
in and to such SellerÂ’s

      
 

 



 

Shares, free and clear of all Liens, other than restrictions arising from
applicable securities Laws, in exchange for the Purchase Price.

 



 

(b) The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that, at the
Closing, each Option that is then outstanding and unexercised (whether vested
or unvested) shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive at the
Closing from the Company, in consideration for such cancellation, an amount in
cash, if greater than zero, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Common Stock subject to such Option immediately prior to such cancellation
(whether vested or unvested), and (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) an amount
equal to (1) the Estimated Purchase Price (without, for these purposes, giving
effect to the deduction in clause (e) of the definition of Estimated Purchase
Price) _divided_ by (2) the number of Fully Diluted Shares over (y) the
applicable exercise price of such Option (the " _Option Payment_ "). In
addition, the Optionholders shall be entitled to receive a portion of any
amounts calculated pursuant to _Section 2.05(c)_ based on such OptionholderÂ’s
percentage set forth on the Payout Schedule. The Option Payments shall be
subject to all applicable federal, state and local Tax withholding
requirements.

 



 

SECTION 2.02 _Purchase Price_.

 



 

(a) The aggregate purchase price for the Shares is an amount equal to the sum
of (i) the amount set forth on _Schedule C_ _plus_ (ii) the Share
Consideration Value (the aggregate amount in clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Base
Purchase Price_ "), _plus_ (iii) the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, _plus_ (iv) the RGGI Adjustment Amount, _minus_ (v) the
Closing Date Net Indebtedness Amount, _minus_ (vi) the aggregate amount of the
Option Payments to be made by the Company pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ and
_minus_ (vii) the Broker Amount (the sum of the amounts described in the
immediately preceding clauses (i) through (vii), being referred to herein as
the " _Purchase Price_ ").

 



 

(b) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Purchaser a written notice setting forth (i) the
amounts of the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the Estimated
RGGI Adjustment Amount, the Estimated Net Indebtedness Amount, the Broker
Amount, the Estimated Purchase Price and the Closing Payment, in each case,
which shall be calculated in accordance with the methodology set forth on
_Annex D_ , together with reasonable supporting information and calculations,
and (ii) a schedule allocating (A) the Share Consideration between the
Sellers, (B) the Closing Payment payable to each of the Sellers and the Option
Payments payable to each of the Optionholders and setting forth the account or
accounts to which the Closing Payment (or allocated portions thereof) or
Option Payments should be delivered and, (C) the allocable percentages of
amounts to be paid to the Sellers and the Optionholders pursuant to _Section
2.05(c)_ , if any, as between each Seller and each Optionholder, (D) the
allocable percentages of amounts to be paid by the Sellers pursuant to
_Section 2.05(c)_ or _Article 9_ , if any, as between each Seller, (E) the
Escrow Amount payable into the Escrow Account and (F) the Broker Amount among
the Persons set forth on Section 3.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
Section 4.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and setting forth the account
or accounts to which the Broker Amount (or allocated portions thereof) should
be delivered (clause (ii), the " _Payout Schedule_ ").

      
 

 



 

(c) At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to each Seller its allocated portion
of the Closing Payment, shall pay to the Company to pay to each Optionholder
its allocated portion of the Option Payments, shall pay to each Person set
forth on Section 3.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and Section 4.15 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule its allocated portion of the Broker Amount,
and shall pay into the Escrow Account the Escrow Amount, in each case, as set
forth on the Payout Schedule by wire transfer of immediately available funds
in U.S. Dollars to such account(s) as set forth on the Payout Schedule;
_provided_ , that prior to the Closing, if Sellers direct Purchaser to pay any
portion of the Option Payments to the Sellers pursuant to any escrow
arrangement entered into between Sellers and the applicable Optionholders,
Purchaser shall pay such portion of the Option Payments to the Sellers at the
Closing instead of to the Company.

 



 

SECTION 2.03 _Closing_. The closing of the purchase and sale of the Shares
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP,
at 885 Third Avenue, New York, New York, 10022, at 10:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the third Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article 7_ (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), or at such other time, date and
place as may be mutually agreed upon in writing by the Parties (the date on
which the Closing actually occurs being referred to as the " _Closing Date_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that, the Closing Date shall not occur prior to
the first Business Day after the final day of the Marketing Period applicable
at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Closing and the Brayton Point Closing shall occur
simultaneously.

defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code, and (b) proof reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser that the Company has provided notice of such

that PurchaserÂ’s sole right in the event the Sellers fail to cause such

      
 

 



 

FIRPTA Certificate to be delivered pursuant to this clause (iii) shall be to
make an appropriate withholding to the extent required by Section 1445 of the
Code;

 



 

(iv) the Escrow Agreement, duly executed by each of the Sellers and the
Company;

 



 

(v) certificates of good standing of the Sellers and each Acquired Company, or

(vi) such other agreements, documents, instruments and writings as are
required to be delivered by the Sellers at or prior to the Closing pursuant to
_Section 7.02_ or as are otherwise reasonably required in connection with this
Agreement; and

relevant books, records (including, closing trial balances and detailed
reconciliations of balance sheet accounts) and employees (and those of the
Acquired Companies) as they may reasonably request in connection with the
matters addressed in this _Section 2.05_. Within ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to the Sellers a statement (the "
_Purchaser Â’s Statement_") setting forth its calculation of the Purchase Price
(including the Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the RGGI
Adjustment Amount and the Closing Date Net Indebtedness Amount) together with
reasonable supporting information and calculations.

 



 

(b) If the Sellers object to any matter set forth on the PurchaserÂ’s
Statement, then they shall provide Purchaser written notice thereof within
thirty (30) days after receiving the PurchaserÂ’s Statement, which notice shall
specify in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute and the disputed
items; _provided_ , that the Sellers and Purchaser shall be deemed to have
agreed upon all items and amounts that are not disputed by the Sellers in such
written notice. If the Parties are unable to agree on any matter set forth on
the PurchaserÂ’s Statement disputed by the Sellers in accordance with this
_Section 2.05(b)_ , within one hundred thirty-five (135) days after the
Closing Date, the Parties shall refer such dispute to KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP
declines to act as provided in this _Section 2.05(b)_ , a firm of independent
public accountants, mutually acceptable to Purchaser and the Sellers (the "
_Independent Accountants_ "), and the Parties shall cause such firm to make a
final and binding determination

      
 

 



 

as to only those matters in dispute with respect to this _Section 2.05(b)_ on
a timely basis, and, in any event, within thirty (30) days following its
appointment, and shall cause such firm promptly to notify the Parties in
writing of its resolution. The Parties shall not authorize the Independent
Accountants to modify or amend any term or provision of this Agreement or
modify items previously agreed among the Parties. The fees and other costs
charged by the Independent Accountants shall be borne by Purchaser and the
Sellers in proportion to the amounts by which their proposed calculations of
the Purchase Price as initially submitted to the Independent Accountant
differed from the Independent AccountantÂ’s final calculation of the Purchase
Price divided by the aggregate amount by which such proposed calculations of
the Purchase Price differed from the Independent AccountantÂ’s final
calculation of the Purchase Price. If the Sellers do not object to any matter
set forth on the PurchaserÂ’s Statement within the time period and in the
manner set forth in the first sentence of this _Section 2.05(b)_ or if the
Sellers accept the PurchaserÂ’s Statement, then the PurchaserÂ’s Statement shall
become final and binding upon the Parties for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

(c) If the Purchase Price, as finally determined as provided in _Section
2.05(b)_ (as agreed between the Parties or as determined by the Independent
Accountants), (i) exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, then Purchaser shall
pay the Sellers and shall pay the Company to pay to the Optionholders an
amount equal to the amount of such excess (to be apportioned among the Sellers
and Optionholders pursuant to the percentages set forth on the Payout
Schedule), within five (5) Business Days after such amounts are agreed or
determined pursuant to _Section 2.05(b)_ , by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated with respect to such
Sellers in the Payout Schedule, (ii) is less than the Estimated Purchase
Price, then Purchaser and the Sellers shall notify the Escrow Agent to
disburse to Purchaser from the Escrow Account in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement an amount equal to the amount of any such shortfall within five (5)
Business Days after such amounts are agreed or determined pursuant to _Section
2.05(b)_ , or (iii) is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, then no payment
shall be made pursuant to this _Section 2.05_.

 



 

SECTION 2.06 _Withholding_. Purchaser and the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as they are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. If Purchaser determines that any deduction or
withholding is required in respect of a payment pursuant to this Agreement,
Purchaser shall provide notice to the Sellers no less than fifteen (15) days
prior to the date on which such payment is to be made, with a written
explanation substantiating the requirement to withhold, provided, however,
that if the Sellers fail to deliver the certification contemplated by _Section
2.04(a)(iii)_ then Purchaser shall not be required to provide any such notice
or written explanation with respect to amounts required to be withheld
pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code as a result of such failure. Purchaser
and the Company shall promptly remit all withheld amounts to the applicable
Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable Law. Any amounts that are so
deducted and withheld and promptly remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority
in accordance with applicable Law shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Seller or Optionholder, as applicable,
in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made.

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01_ (the " _Interim
Period_ "), the Company shall provide Purchaser and its Representatives, as
reasonably requested by Purchaser, reasonable access at reasonable times and
upon reasonable prior notice during normal business hours, to the officers and
employees, properties and books and records of the Acquired Companies, but
only to the extent such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
business or operations of the Acquired Companies. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide any information (a)
which any Seller reasonably believes it or the Acquired Companies are
prohibited from providing to Purchaser by reason of applicable Law, (b) which
in the opinion of legal counsel to the Sellers, will result in the loss of
attorney/client privilege, (c) which the Sellers or the Acquired Companies are
required to keep confidential or prevent access to by reason of any Contract
with a third party, (d) relating to pricing or other matters that are highly
sensitive if the exchange of such documents (or portions thereof) or
information, as determined by the SellersÂ’ counsel, might reasonably result in
antitrust difficulties for the Sellers or their Affiliates or (e) relating to
any potential sale of

      
 

 



 

any of the Acquired Companies or the Facilities to any other Person, provided
that the Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements, or seek appropriate waivers or consents,
under circumstances in which the restrictions of clause (a) of this sentence
apply. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, during the Interim Period,
Purchaser shall not be permitted to contact any of the Acquired CompaniesÂ’
employees, vendors, customers or suppliers regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without receiving prior written authorization
from the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided
pursuant to this _Section 6.01_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ that Purchaser shall be permitted to contact
certain of the Acquired CompaniesÂ’ employees, vendors, customers or suppliers,
in coordination with the Company, for the sole purpose of discussing the
transition in ownership of the Acquired Companies.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section 6.01(a)_ , at any time
and from time to time after the date hereof, Sellers will allow, and will
cause the Acquired Companies to allow, Purchaser and its representatives
reasonable access to the Derivative Products trading operations of the
Acquired Companies and their respective books and records, and will cooperate
with Purchaser to develop appropriate procedures to permit Purchaser and its
approved Representatives (such approval by the Sellers not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to monitor the aggregate net positions in
the Derivative Products trading portfolio of the Acquired Companies, subject
to the other terms of this Agreement, the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement and applicable Laws. Purchaser shall have the right to appoint an
individual who will exercise the rights granted to Purchaser pursuant to this
_Section 6.01(b)_ and as further set forth in Section 6.01(b) of the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule. No information made available to Purchaser, its monitor,
or any other individual or entity pursuant to this _Section 6.01(b)_ shall be
made available to any employee of Purchaser or its affiliates (as that term is
defined under FERC regulations) which employee engages in, or directs,
oversees or executes, the sale, marketing, or trading of physical electricity
or financial electricity derivative products.

respect to taxable periods ending on or before, or that include, the Closing
Date, that are required to be filed after the Closing Date and with respect to
Straddle Periods; provided, however, that Purchaser shall

      
 

 



 

prepare all such Tax Returns in accordance with past practice (unless
otherwise required by applicable law). Purchaser shall submit all such Tax
Returns to Sellers no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of
such Tax Returns for the SellersÂ’ review and comment, and Purchaser shall
consider in good faith any such comments received from the Sellers and, for so
long as the Sellers have any surviving indemnity obligations pursuant to

shall cause the Acquired Companies not to, make any election or deemed
election under Section 338 of the Code (or any similar state, local or other

cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by any Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and any Tax contest or other proceeding with respect to such Tax

request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax contest or other proceeding and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The requesting Party shall
reimburse the cooperating Parties for all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by such cooperating Parties.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Taxes_. Purchaser or the Sellers, as required by applicable Law,

Contests_ "). The Sellers shall have the right to control any Tax Contests
relating to Pre-Closing Periods; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall be entitled
to participate in such Tax Contests, the Sellers shall keep Purchaser informed
of the progress of such Tax Contests (including by providing copies of any
material written correspondence in connection therewith) and the Sellers shall
not settle or compromise such Tax Contest without PurchaserÂ’s prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Purchaser
shall have the right to control any Tax Contests relating to the Acquired
Companies that are not controlled by the Sellers pursuant to the previous
sentence; _provided_ , that to the extent such Tax Contests relate to Straddle
Periods, then for so long as the Sellers have any remaining indemnity
obligations pursuant to _Section 9.01(a)(iii)_ , the Sellers shall be entitled
to participate in such Tax Contests, Purchaser shall keep the Sellers informed
of the progress of such Tax

      
 

 



 

Contests (including by providing copies of any material written correspondence
in connection therewith) and Purchaser shall not settle or compromise such Tax
Contest without the SellersÂ’ prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
in the event of any inconsistency between this _Section 6.03(d)_ and _Section
9.03_ with respect to any Tax Contest, this _Section 6.03(d)_ shall govern.

 



 

(e) _Conventions for Allocating Taxes Between Periods_.

 



 

(i) Purchaser acknowledges and covenants that, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law for federal and state income Tax purposes, it will file a
consolidated income Tax Return with the Acquired Companies starting on the day
following the Closing Date and the Acquired Companies will become members of
the affiliated group of corporations of which (to the extent such Acquired
Companies constitute corporations for U.S. federal tax purposes) Dynegy is the
parent on the day following the Closing Date. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to elect to close
their taxable year as of the Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) The parties hereto agree that all Transaction Tax Deductions arising on
or prior to the Closing Date have been or will be incurred before the Closing,
and except as otherwise required by Law, the parties hereto agree to, and
agree to cause their respective Affiliates to, treat for all Tax purposes
(including for purposes of Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) all such Transaction Tax Deductions as deductions
allocable to Pre-Closing Periods.

 



 

(iii) The parties hereto agree, and agree to cause their respective
Affiliates, to utilize the "next day rule" in Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Law) to treat any gain, income or other items that results from transactions
occurring outside the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date after
the Closing as arising in a Post-Closing Period rather than on the Closing
Date.

 



 

(iv) No party shall, or shall allow an Affiliate to, make an election under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (or any other similar
provision of foreign, state or local Law) to ratably allocate items incurred
by the Acquired Companies with respect to the short taxable year ending on the
Closing Date and the taxable year (or portion thereof) beginning on the day
after the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) Any Tax refund or return of any posted amount with the state of
Connecticut (whether as a bond or otherwise) (including any interest paid or
credited with respect thereto) of any Acquired Company relating to taxable
periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date that is
received by the Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies in respect of the
Connecticut Generation Tax (a " _CT Generation Tax Refund_ ") shall be the
property of the Sellers and Optionholders. Purchaser or the applicable
Acquired Company shall, within 10 days after the receipt of any CT Generation
Tax Refund pay to the Sellers and the Optionholders in accordance with the
Payout Schedule the amount of such CT Generation Tax Refund (net of any Tax
detriment to Purchaser or any Acquired Company resulting from, attributable to
or arising in connection with the receipt by Purchaser or any

      
 

 



 

Acquired Company of such refund). At the SellersÂ’ sole expense (such expense
payable solely by the Sellers), Purchaser and its Affiliates shall, and shall
cause the applicable Acquired Company or Acquired Companies to, file for and
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all CT Generation Tax Refunds in
cash; _provided_ that such efforts shall not require Purchaser or its
Affiliates to take any actions that may have an adverse effect on Purchaser or
its Affiliates. Purchaser shall, upon request, permit the Sellers to
participate in the prosecution of any such CT Generation Tax Refund claim and
Purchaser shall provide Sellers advance notice of, and the opportunity to
participate in, any in-person or telephonic meetings with any Governmental
Entities with respect to any CT Generation Tax Refunds. The Parties shall
treat all amounts paid by Purchaser or any Acquired Company under this
_Section 6.03(f)_ as adjustments to the Purchase Price for income Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 



 

SECTION 6.04 _Confidentiality; Publicity_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the information being provided to it in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement,
dated as of May 28, 2014, between Energy Capital Partners, LLC, ECP II and
Dynegy (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate with respect to information
relating solely to the Acquired Companies. Each Seller acknowledges that it
shall not, and it shall cause its Affiliates not to, for a period of two (2)
years after the Closing Date, disclose any Confidential Information which
relates to the Acquired Companies to anyone other than Representatives of
Purchaser or the Acquired Companies, except (i) for any such information that
does not relate primarily to the Acquired Companies or which is requested by
any Governmental Authority or that is required by applicable Law to be
disclosed by it in connection with any Claim, and then, if permitted by Law,
only after such Seller has given written notice to Purchaser of its obligation
to disclose such information so that Purchaser may waive compliance with the
provisions of this _Section 6.04(a)_ or be given an opportunity to obtain an
appropriate protective order with respect to such disclosure, and the Sellers
shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in connection with obtaining such
protective order; provided that, if in the absence of a protective order or
the receipt of a waiver from Purchaser, such Seller has been advised by legal
counsel that it is required to disclose such information, such Seller may
disclose such information, and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt (and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.04_ ),
each such Seller and its Affiliates may, without the prior consent of
Purchaser, issue any non-public release or statement or otherwise disclose
information with respect to this Agreement, other transaction documents or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including the Purchase Price and other
terms of the Agreement or other transaction documents) to any of its
Affiliates, representatives, lenders and current and potential investors, in
each case which are subject to contractual confidentiality obligations with
respect to the information disclosed to them (whether pursuant to such release
or statement or otherwise).

 



 

(b) None of Purchaser, the Sellers, or any of its or their respective
Affiliates shall make any public announcement or issue any public
communication regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or any matter related to the foregoing, without first obtaining the
prior consent of the Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable (which

      
 

 



 

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except if
such announcement or other communication is required by applicable Law or
legal process (including pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act or
any rules promulgated thereunder or the rules of any national securities
exchange), in which case the Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, shall use
their reasonable best efforts to coordinate or communicate such announcement
or communication with the Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable, prior to
announcement or issuance; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to _Section
6.04_ , each Party and its Affiliates may make internal announcements
regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to their and
their AffiliatesÂ’ respective directors and officers and employees without the
consent of the other Party; and provided, further, that, subject to _Section
6.01_ and _Section 6.04_ , the foregoing shall not prohibit any Party from
communicating with third parties to the extent necessary for the purpose of
seeking any third party consent.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement or
subsections (a) and (b) hereof, nothing in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement shall prevent Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries
from disclosing any information, including "Evaluation Material" and the
Required Financial Information (i) to any Financing Party in connection with
any Financing so long as (A) such recipient shall be subject to
confidentiality obligations consistent with those set forth in the second
paragraph of Section 9 of the Commitment Letter (as in effect on the date
hereof) and (B) Purchaser and its Affiliates enforce their rights under the
Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof with respect to the
confidentiality of any such information, (ii) in an offering circular,
prospectus, bank book, comfort letters or private placement memorandum in
connection with any Financing, (iii) for the purposes of establishing a "due
diligence" defense in connection with any Financing, (iv) to the extent
reasonably necessary to perform any diligence with respect to, or confirm the
accuracy of the Required Financial Information or (v) with SellersÂ’ consent,
as applicable. In addition to, and not in limitation of, the above, in
furtherance of SellersÂ’ obligations under _Section 6.18_ , Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries may disclose any information, including Evaluation Material,
to any Financing Party involved in the preparation of the information provided
pursuant to _Section 6.18_ to the extent reasonably necessary to perform any
diligence with respect to, or confirm the accuracy of, the Required Financial
Information, in each case subject to (x) the SellersÂ’ prior consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (y) the recipient of such
information being subject to the confidentiality obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement and this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not disclose any information, including any
Evaluation Material, that would cause any of the Acquired Companies to be in
breach or default under any representation or warranty of the Acquired
Companies set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 6.05 _Post-Closing Books and Records; Financial Statements_. As of the
Closing and subject to _Section 6.04(a)_ , the Sellers and their Affiliates
shall be entitled to retain copies (at the SellersÂ’ sole cost and expense) of
any such books, records and other documents which pertain solely to the
ownership or operation of the Acquired Companies. Purchaser shall, and shall
cause the Acquired Companies to, retain, for at least seven (7) years after
the Closing Date, all material books, records and other documents pertaining
to the Acquired CompaniesÂ’ businesses that relate to the period prior to the
Closing Date, except for Tax Returns and supporting documentation relating to
the Acquired CompaniesÂ’ businesses or the Acquired

      
 

 



 

CompaniesÂ’ assets which shall be retained until sixty (60) days after the date
required by applicable Law, and to make the same available after the Closing
Date for inspection and copying by the Sellers (at the SellersÂ’ sole cost and
expense), during regular business hours without significant disruption to the
Acquired CompaniesÂ’ businesses and upon reasonable request and upon reasonable
advance notice. At and after the expiration of such period, if the Sellers or
any of their Affiliates have previously requested in writing that such books
and records be preserved, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies to, either preserve such books and records for such reasonable
period as may be requested by the Sellers or transfer such books and records
to the Sellers or their designated Affiliates, in each case at the SellersÂ’
expense.

 



 

SECTION 6.06 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the Closing takes place, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the Party incurring such costs and expenses, including any fees,
expenses or other payments incurred or owed by a Party to any brokers,
financial or legal advisors or comparable other persons retained or employed
by such Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 6.07 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Benefit Plans_. From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the Acquired Companies to, assume and honor all liabilities and
obligations to or in respect of the Company Employees under all Benefit Plans.

 



 

(b) _Continuation of Compensation and Benefits_. For a one (1)-year period
following the Closing, Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
to each Continuing Employee who is not covered by a CBA (each, a " _Non-
Unionized Continuing Employee_ "): (i) annual base salary no less than the
annual base salary provided to such Non- Unionized Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) incentive compensation
opportunities that are no less favorable and employee benefits that are no
less favorable in the aggregate to such Non-Unionized Continuing Employee than
those incentive compensation opportunities and employee benefits,
respectively, that Purchaser or its Affiliates provide to their similarly
situated employees during such period. Nothing in this _Section 6.07_ shall
require Purchaser or its Affiliates or any Acquired Company to continue the
employment of any Non-Unionized Continuing Employee for any specified period.

 



 

(c) _Severance and Paid Time Off_. Without limiting the foregoing provisions
of this _Section 6.07_ , for a one (1)-year period following the Closing,
Purchaser shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, severance and paid
time off benefits to each Non-Unionized Continuing Employee that,
respectively, are no less favorable than the severance and paid time off
benefits in effect in respect of such Non-Unionized Continuing Employee
immediately before the Closing pursuant to (i) if such Non-Unionized
Continuing Employee is a party to an employment agreement with the Company, as
in effect immediately before the Closing (each, an " _Employment Agreement_
"), such Non-Unionized Continuing EmployeeÂ’s Employment Agreement, or (ii) if
such Non-Unionized Continuing Employee is not party to an Employment
Agreement, the Company Severance Policy, as effective July 1, 2014 (the "
_Company Severance Policy_ "). With respect to any Non-Unionized Continuing
Employee whose

      
 

 



 

employment with any Acquired Company terminates under circumstances giving
rise to severance (the date of such termination of employment, such Non-
Unionized Continuing EmployeeÂ’s " _Employment Termination Date_ ") during the
period between the Closing Date and the day immediately prior to the six-month
anniversary of the Closing Date and who, during the period between such Non-
Unionized Continuing EmployeeÂ’s Employment Termination Date and the six month
anniversary of such Employment Termination Date, is hired to perform services
by any of Sellers or any Affiliate of any of Sellers other than the Acquired
Companies (each a " _Seller Employer_ "), Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser
for a portion of the severance payments payable to such Non-Unionized
Continuing Employee, with such portion to be determined by multiplying the
total amount of the severance payments payable to such Non-Unionized
Continuing Employee by a fraction, (A) in the case of any Non-Unionized
Continuing Employee who is a party to an Employment Agreement, the numerator
of which is the number of days such Non-Unionized Continuing Employee is
employed by a Seller Employer during the period during which such severance
payments are payable pursuant to such Employment Agreement (such period, such
Non-Unionized Continuing EmployeeÂ’s " _Employment Agreement Severance Period_
") and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such Non-
Unionized Continuing EmployeeÂ’s Employment Agreement Severance Period and (B)
in the case of any Non-Unionized Continuing Employee who is not party to an
employment agreement, the numerator of which is the number of days such Non-
Unionized Continuing Employee is employed by a Seller Employer during such
Non-Unionized Continuing EmployeeÂ’s Severance Policy Severance Period and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such Non-Unionized
Continuing EmployeeÂ’s Severance Policy Severance Period; _provided_ that, for
purposes of this sentence, no severance benefits agreed to by Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) after the Closing in excess of
the amounts provided for under the applicable Employment Agreement or the
Company Severance Policy, as applicable, shall be taken into account. Any
amount to be reimbursed by the Sellers pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence shall be disbursed from the Escrow Fund.

 



 

(d) _Benefit Continuation Waivers for Non-Unionized Continuing Employees_.
Purchaser shall waive or cause to be waived all limitations as to preexisting
conditions or waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to each Non-Unionized Continuing Employee under any
employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Purchaser or any Affiliate
thereof in which Non-Unionized Continuing Employees participate (or are
eligible to participate) that are "welfare benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) to the same extent that such conditions and waiting
periods were satisfied or waived under the comparable Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Closing. In addition, Purchaser shall provide or cause to be
provided each Non-Unionized Continuing Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid during the plan year commencing immediately
prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any applicable co-payments,
deductibles or other out-of-pocket requirements under any such welfare benefit
plans for such plan year.

 



 

(e) _Service Credit for Non-Unionized Continuing Employees_. Purchaser shall
provide, or cause to be provided, to each Non-Unionized Continuing Employee
credit for all service prior to the Closing Date, to the same extent as such
service was credited under the comparable Benefit Plan or arrangement or
entitlement of any Acquired Company, under all benefit plans and arrangements
and employment-related entitlements (including severance and

      
 

 



 

vacation/paid time-off policies) of Purchaser or its Affiliates for purposes
of eligibility and vesting and, for purposes of severance and paid time off
benefits, for purposes of benefit accrual and determination of level of
benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such service shall not be recognized
to the extent that it results in the duplication of benefits for the same
period of service.

 



 

(f) _401(k) Plan_. Subject to the requirements of any CBA, with respect to
each Benefit Plan that is a 401(k) plan (any such plan, a " _401(k) Plan_ "),
following the Closing, Purchaser shall either (i) merge such 401(k) Plan into
a 401(k) plan of Purchaser or its Affiliates or (ii) continue to maintain such
401(k) Plan as a separate plan for Continuing Employees.

 



 

(g) _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. Purchaser shall cause the applicable
Acquired Company to (i) continue to recognize each labor union that is party
to a CBA as the collective bargaining representative for the applicable
Continuing Employees covered by such CBA effective upon the Closing Date; (ii)
continue to honor each CBA effective upon the Closing Date under the terms and
conditions of such CBA; (iii) retain all liabilities and obligations under the
CBAs to which any such Acquired Company is a party as of the Closing Date; and
(iv) indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their Affiliates with respect
to any Claims and liabilities attributable to the CBAs on or after the Closing
Date. The Sellers agree to, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, engage
in any type of bargaining that is required under the CBAs and Law prior to the
Closing Date and in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement.

 



 

(h) _Third-Party Rights_. The provisions of this _Section 6.07_ are for the
sole benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any
person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Company Employee), other
than the Parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns,
any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any
provision of this Agreement. Nothing contained herein, express or implied: (i)
shall be construed to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement; (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of the
Sellers, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement; or (iii) is
intended to confer upon any current or former employee any right to employment
or continued employment for any period of time by reason of this Agreement, or
any right to a particular term or condition of employment.

 



 

SECTION 6.08 _Further Actions_.

 



 

(a) During the Interim Period, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Party agrees to use reasonable best efforts (except where a
different efforts standard is specifically contemplated by this Agreement, in
which case such different standard shall apply) to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in an expeditious manner.

      
 

 



 

(b) The Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Required Consents, any required
approvals of parties to Contracts with the Acquired Companies, and any Filings
or Consents with or from any Governmental Entity, including by (i) preparing
and filing as soon as practicable (and in any event, within twenty-one (21)
Business Days following the date of this Agreement) all necessary filings
required to be made with FERC under Section 203 of the Federal Power Act, as
amended, which shall be submitted to FERC in a form mutually acceptable to the
Parties, (ii) preparing and filing as soon as practicable (and in any event,
for the HSR Act, within twenty-one (21) Business Days following the date of
this Agreement) all such Filings or Consents with or from any Governmental
Entity or other Person that are required to be filed or obtained in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) assuring that all such
Filings are in material compliance with the requirements of applicable
regulatory laws, (iv) making available to the other party such information as
the other party may reasonably request in order to complete the Filings or to
respond to information requests by any relevant Governmental Entity, (v)
subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, keeping each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby, including
but not limited to promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications, filings or correspondence between the Parties, or any of
their respective subsidiaries, and any Governmental Entity (or members of
their respective staffs) with respect to the transactions, (vi) responding to
and complying with, as promptly as reasonably practicable, any request for
information or documentary material regarding the transactions from any
relevant Governmental Entity (including responding to any "second request" for
additional information or documentary material under the HSR Act as promptly
as reasonably practicable), (vii) using their respective reasonable best
efforts to cause the prompt expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period and clearance or approval by any relevant Governmental Entity,
including defense against, and the resolution of, any objections or
challenges, in court or otherwise, by any relevant Governmental Entity
preventing consummation of the transactions, (viii) using their respective
reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to cause all conditions
set forth in _Article 7_ to be satisfied as soon as practicable, and (ix)
executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to fully carry
out the purposes of this Agreement. Each Party shall bear its own fees, costs
and all other expenses associated with any Filings or Consents with or from
any third party in connection with or otherwise related to the transactions
contemplated hereby, except that all HSR Act filing fees shall be paid by
Purchaser. Prior to communicating any information to any Governmental Entity
(or members of their respective staffs) in oral or written form, each Party
shall permit counsel for the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review
and provide comments thereon, and consider in good faith the views of the
other Party in connection with, any proposed communication to any Governmental
Entity (or members of their respective staffs) to the extent permitted by Law.
Each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company and the Sellers, on the
other hand, agrees not to participate in any meeting or discussion, either in
person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
proposed transaction unless it consults with the other Party in advance and,
to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity or by Law, gives the
other Party the opportunity to attend and participate where appropriate and
advisable under the circumstances.

      
 

 



 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, except as would be reasonably likely to result in
a material adverse effect upon the business of Purchaser and its Affiliates
(which, for these purposes, shall be deemed to include the Combined Acquired
Companies), taken as a whole, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall commit to any
and all divestitures, licenses, hold separate or similar arrangements, conduct
of business restrictions, and other actions and non-actions with respect to
its assets and businesses as a condition to obtaining any and all Consents
from Governmental Entities, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than the Outside Date, including committing to take any and all actions
necessary in order to ensure that (x) no requirement for non-action, a waiver,
consent or approval of the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, any State
Attorney General or other Governmental Entity, (y) no decree, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or
proceeding, and (z) no other matter relating to any antitrust or competition
law or regulation, would preclude the occurrence of the Closing by the Outside
Date.

 



 

(d) Each Party shall (i) promptly inform the other Party of any material
communication made to, or received by, such Party from, any Governmental
Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any inquiries or requests for additional
information and documentary material received from any Governmental Entity and
(iii) except as required by applicable Law, not enter into any agreement with
any Governmental Entity agreeing not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Subject to the compliance of the Parties with this _Section 6.08_ ,
Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers and the Company, on the other
hand, shall not have any liability whatsoever to the other Party arising out
of or relating to the failure to obtain any Consents or make any Filings, or
because of the termination of, or default under, any Contract, in each case to
the extent such Consents, Filings or Contracts are listed on Section 3.03 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, Section 4.04 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or Section 5.01(c) of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(f) Purchaser further agrees that during the Interim Period, neither it nor
its Affiliates will enter into any other Contract to acquire or market or
control the output of, nor acquire or market or control the output of,
electric generation facilities or uncommitted generation capacity in the ISO-
NE market if the proposed acquisition or the ability to market or control
output of such additional electric generation facilities or uncommitted
generation capacity in the ISO-NE market could reasonably be expected to
increase the market power attributable to Purchaser and its Affiliates in the
ISO-NE market in a manner materially adverse to approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Brayton Point Agreement or that would
reasonably be expected to otherwise prevent or materially interfere with, or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement or the Brayton Point Agreement.

       
 

 



 

SECTION 6.09 _Post-Closing Cooperation; Further Assurances_.

 



 

(a) After Closing, upon prior reasonable written request, each Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in furnishing
records, information, oral or written testimony, oral or written attestations
and certifications, and other assistance in connection with transition matters
and any inquiries or proceedings involving the Acquired Companies, but
excluding any proceedings arising from disputes among the Parties. Each such
requesting Party shall reimburse such cooperating Party for any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses paid or incurred by such cooperating Party as a result
of any such requested cooperation.

 



 

(b) Each Party shall, on the request of any other Party, execute such further
documents, and perform such further acts, as may be necessary or appropriate
to give full effect to the allocation of rights, benefits, obligations and
liabilities contemplated by this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

SECTION 6.10 _Support Obligations_.

 



 

(a) Prior to Closing, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
(and shall reasonably cooperate with the SellersÂ’ efforts) to terminate, or
cause Purchaser or any of the Acquired Companies to be substituted in all
respects for the Seller and their Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies) under, and the Sellers, their Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies), and where applicable, their sureties or letter of credit issuers,
to be released from their respective obligations under, the Support
Obligations set forth in Section 6.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule as
soon as possible after Closing. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
preceding sentence, at the SellersÂ’ request, Purchaser will offer (and
provide, if accepted) (i) a sufficient amount of letters of credit, (ii) cash
collateral, and (iii) to assume the SellersÂ’ or their AffiliatesÂ’ obligations
under guaranties, to the counterparties with respect to the Support
Obligations to enable the Sellers and their Affiliates to terminate such
Support Obligations without liability or otherwise be released or replaced in
connection therewith; provided that, with respect to each Support Obligation,
Purchaser shall not be required under this _Section 6.10_ to deliver
replacement credit support of the same type as, or with terms and conditions
substantially similar to, such Support Obligations, provided that the
replacement credit support delivered by Purchaser complies with the terms and
conditions of the applicable Contract or is otherwise acceptable to the
counterparty thereto. For any Support Obligations for which Purchaser or any
of the Acquired Companies, as applicable, is not substituted in all respects
for the Sellers and their Affiliates (and for which the Sellers and their
Affiliates are not released) effective as of the Closing, (a) Purchaser shall
continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts and shall cause the
Acquired Companies to use their commercially reasonable best efforts to effect
such substitution and release as soon as possible after the Closing, and
provided, that in the event that any Support Obligation cannot be replaced at
or prior to the Closing, PurchaserÂ’s obligations hereunder shall be satisfied
if Purchaser or its Affiliate enters into at Closing a back-to-back guarantee
with respect to such Support Obligation for the benefit of the Sellers in the
form of an irrevocable, standby letter of credit or other similar form of
security for 100% of the SellersÂ’ or their AffiliatesÂ’ obligations with
respect to such Support Obligation and (b) the Sellers and their Affiliates
shall continue to maintain such Support Obligations as required pursuant to
the terms of the Support Obligations and the related Contracts.

      
 

 



 

(b) If any continuing Support Obligation addressed by the last sentence of
_Section 6.10(a)_ is drawn upon after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay,
or cause the applicable Acquired Company to pay, Sellers or their designees
the amount so claimed or drawn within ten (10) Business Days after the date of
the draw. If Purchaser, or the applicable Acquired Company, fails to pay
Sellers or their designees during such ten (10) Business Day period, Sellers
may draw upon the back-to-back guarantee provided by Purchaser or its
Affiliate in accordance with the terms thereof.

 



 

SECTION 6.11 _Insurance_. Purchaser shall be solely responsible for providing
insurance to the Acquired Companies for any event or occurrence after the
Closing. Subject to _Section 6.14_ , the Sellers shall maintain or cause to be
maintained in full force and effect the material Insurance Policies covering
the Acquired Companies until the Closing.

 



 

SECTION 6.12 _No Solicitation; Alternative Transactions_. During the Interim
Period, neither the Sellers nor any Acquired Company shall, and the Sellers
shall cause their Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person or group (other
than any Party or any Affiliate, associate or designee of any Party)
concerning any proposal for the sale, merger, combination, joint venture or
other transaction involving all or any part of the business and properties of
the Acquired Companies, other than providing information in connection with
the transaction contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

SECTION 6.13 _Schedule Update_. From time to time prior to the Closing, any
Seller or the Company, as the case may be, may, at its respective option,
supplement or amend and deliver updates to the Company Disclosure Schedule
(each a " _Schedule Update_ "), that are necessary to complete or correct any
information in such Company Disclosure Schedule or in any representation or
warranty of the Sellers or the Company, as the case may be, that has been
rendered inaccurate or incomplete due solely to any change, event, effect or
occurrence since the date of this Agreement. If (a) Purchaser has the right to
terminate the Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)_ as a result of such
Schedule Update and does not exercise such right within twenty (20) Business
Days thereof and (b) the Schedule Update pursuant to this _Section 6.13_
relates solely to events occurring or conditions arising after the date of
this Agreement, then such Schedule Update shall be deemed to have amended the
Company Disclosure Schedule as of the date of this Agreement, to have
qualified the representations and warranties contained in _Article 3_ with
respect to the Sellers or _Article 4_ with respect to the Company, as of the
date of this Agreement, and to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of the
existence of such matter. The Sellers or the Company, as applicable, shall
provide to Purchaser any information relating to any Schedule Update
reasonably requested by Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) Purchaser
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement and it shall not otherwise
be deemed a breach of this Agreement as a result of any Schedule Updates that
relate to any actions permitted by or taken in accordance with _Section 6.02_
and (ii) if (x) Purchaser does not have the right to terminate the Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)_ as a result of a Schedule Update or (y) a
Schedule Update pursuant to this _Section 6.13_ does not relate solely to
events occurring or conditions

      
 

 



 

arising after the date of this Agreement, then such Schedule Update shall not
be deemed to have amended the Company Disclosure Schedule as of the date of
this Agreement, to have qualified the representations and warranties contained
in Article 3 with respect to the Sellers or Article 4 with respect to the
Company, as of the date of this Agreement, or to have cured any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty that may exist hereunder by reason of
the existence of such matter.

 



 

SECTION 6.14 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director, officer and employee of the Acquired
Companies against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneysÂ’
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any Claim, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Closing, to the fullest extent that the applicable Acquired
Company would have been permitted under applicable Law and its respective
Organizational Documents in effect on the date hereof to indemnify such person
(including promptly advancing expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law). Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser
shall cause each Acquired Company (i) to maintain for a period of not less
than six (6) years from the Closing, provisions in its Organizational
Documents concerning the indemnification and exculpation (including relating
to expense advancement) of such Acquired CompanyÂ’s former and current
officers, directors, employees, parents and agents that are no less favorable
to those Persons than the provisions of the Organizational Documents of such
Acquired Company, in each case, as of the date hereof and (ii) not to amend,
repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any respect that would adversely
affect the rights of those Persons thereunder, in each case, except as
required by Law. Purchaser shall assume, and be jointly and severally liable
for, and shall cause each Acquired Company to honor, each of the covenants in
this _Section 6.14_.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause coverage to be extended
under the CompanyÂ’s current directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance by
obtaining a six (6)-year "tail" policy containing terms not more favorable
than the terms of such current insurance coverage with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing, provided that the premium
for such coverage is paid in full by the Sellers or the Company prior to the
Closing.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this
_Section 6.14_ shall survive the Closing indefinitely and shall be binding,
jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Purchaser and the
Company. In the event that Purchaser or the Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser or the Company, as the
case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.14_.

      
 

 



 

SECTION 6.15 _Payment of Indebtedness_.

 



 

(a) At or immediately prior to the Closing, and subject to the other terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement (i) Purchaser shall make available to
the Company, or pay directly, an amount sufficient to pay all amounts provided
for in the Pay-Off Letters (as defined below) and (ii) the Company, if such
amount is not paid directly by Purchaser, shall apply such cash to pay all
amounts provided for in the Pay-Off Letters on the Closing Date (but
immediately prior to the Closing).

 



 

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser a fully
executed copy of customary pay-off letters (the " _Pay-Off Letters_ ") from
the administrative agent under the Credit Agreement and each counterparty to
an Interest Rate Hedge confirming the pay-off of all outstanding Indebtedness
under the Credit Agreement and all obligations under the Interest Rate Hedges
(which Pay-Off Letters (i) shall provide that the payoff shall not occur until
the transfer to the administrative agent or applicable counterparty of the
applicable pay-off amount thereunder, (ii) may permit the survival of
contingent obligations under the Credit Agreement or such Interest Rate Hedge
to the extent contemplated thereby as of the date hereof, (iii) shall not
contain any Lien releases or terminations of any collateral documents unless
all of the Commodity Hedges are novated as contemplated by _Section 6.15(c)_
and (iv) shall contain an acknowledgment by such administrative agent and such
counterparties that such persons, from and after the receipt of the applicable
pay-off or termination amount, disclaim any interests in the Collateral (as
defined in the Loan Documents)).

 



 

(c) Upon the written request of Purchaser, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to novate any Commodity Hedges (as defined in the Credit
Agreement) to Purchaser at Closing; _provided_ , that to the extent that all
such Commodity Hedges are not novated as of the Closing, neither the Sellers
nor any of the Acquired Companies will have any obligation to deliver any Lien
releases under the Loan Documents at or prior to Closing pursuant to _Section
6.15(b)_.

 



 

SECTION 6.16 _Notices to Escrow Agent_. Sellers and Purchaser shall provide
the Escrow Agent with such notices, directions and instructions (as are
necessary for the Escrow Agent to fulfill its obligations set forth in the
Escrow Agreement) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 6.17 _Cyber Preparedness_. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall
use, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to use, commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with Purchaser prior to taking any material steps to comply
with any Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards or any changes approved
by FERC to the Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards and give due
consideration to concerns and comments raised by Purchaser.

 



 

SECTION 6.18 _Financing; Cooperation with Financing_.

 



 

(a) During the Interim Period, Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, as
promptly as possible, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment
Letter, including maintaining in effect the

      
 

 



 

Commitment Letter and using reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
possible, (i) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Purchaser
set forth in the Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Commitment Letter (including any related flex provisions) or on other
terms in the aggregate not materially less favorable to Purchaser, (iii)
timely prepare the necessary marketing materials with respect to any Financing
and (iv) commence the syndication activities contemplated by the Commitment
Letter. Purchaser shall give the Sellers prompt written notice (1) of any
material breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result in
breach or default) by any party to the Commitment Letter or other Financing
Document of which Purchaser becomes aware, (2) if and when Purchaser becomes
aware that any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter
may not be available to consummate the sale and purchase of the Shares, (3) of
the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Person with respect to any (A) actual or potential material breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or other
Financing Document or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among
any parties to the Commitment Letter or other Financing Document (but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course negotiations with
respect to the terms of the Financing or Financing Documents), (4) if for any
reason Purchaser believes in good faith it will not be able to obtain any
portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner and from the sources
contemplated by the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto (such definitive agreements related to any Financing,
collectively, with the Commitment Letter, the " _Financing Documents_ ") and
(5) of any termination of the Commitment Letter. If any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Commitment Letter (including flex terms), Purchaser shall, without limiting
the obligations of Purchaser set forth in the immediately following sentence,
use all reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing,
including from alternative sources, on terms in the aggregate not materially
less favorable to Purchaser than the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter (" _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event and the provisions of this _Section 6.18(a)_ ,
_Section 6.18(b)_ and _Section 11.07_ shall be applicable to the Alternative
Financing, and all references to any Financing shall be deemed to include such
Alternative Financing, all references to the Commitment Letter or other
Financing Documents shall include the applicable documents for the Alternative
Financing and all references to the Financing Sources or Financing Parties, as
applicable, shall include the lenders party to the Alternative Financing.
Purchaser shall (x) comply in all material respects with the Commitment Letter
and each definitive agreement with respect thereto, including the Financing
Documents, (y) enforce in all material respects their rights under each
Financing Document and (z) not permit, without the prior written consent of
the Sellers, any material amendment or modification to be made to, or any
material waiver of any provision or remedy under, any Financing Document or
the fee letter referred to in the Commitment Letter. Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing, or any Alternative Financing,
is not a condition to Closing and, subject to the third sentence of _Section
11.07_ , reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of any
Financing or any Alternative Financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of
the conditions set forth in _Article 7_.

be required to incur any liability in connection with the Financing prior to
the Closing, (2) nothing in this _Section 6.18(b)_ , _(c)_ or _(d)_ shall
require cooperation to the extent that it would (A) cause any condition to
Closing set forth in _Article 7_ to not be satisfied or otherwise cause any
breach of this Agreement or (B) require the Acquired Companies to take any
action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate the
CompanyÂ’s Organizational Documents or any Law, or result in the material

Acquired Companies, as applicable. Except for the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Article 4_ , the Company and its

Information and the provision of any comfort letters, and, to the extent
Purchaser does not pay the Company, the applicable Acquired Company or the

date of the PurchaserÂ’s Statement, the Company shall be deemed to have a
current asset in the amount of such unreimbursed costs and expenses (and no

Agreement, the condition set forth in _Section 7.02(d)_ , as it applies to the

including combined balance sheets, statements of operations, statements of
cash flows, statements of stockholders equity of the Combined Acquired
Companies as of and for (A) the year ended December 31, 2011 as required by,
and in compliance with, GAAP and Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X and (B) the years
ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 as required by, and in
compliance with, GAAP and Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X, (ii) to the extent that
the Closing Date has not occurred prior to February 12, 2015, audited

Combined Acquired Companies as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 as

_provided_ , that the references to Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X in clauses (i)
and (ii) of this definition of "Required Financial Information" are not
intended to, and do not, change the required timing of the delivery of
information required under this Agreement, (iii) unaudited financial
statements including combined balance sheets, statements of operations and
statements of cash flows of the Combined Acquired Companies as of and for the
six month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2014, which shall have been reviewed

Companies, as applicable, as provided in the procedures specified by the
Public Company

      
 

 



 

Accounting Oversight Board in AU 722 (excluding notes that would be required
by GAAP or normal year-end adjustments) and (iv) if the Closing Date has not
occurred prior to November 6, 2014, unaudited financial statements including
combined balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of cash flows
of the Combined Acquired Companies as of and for the nine month periods ended

accountants for the Acquired Companies or Combined Acquired Companies, as
applicable, as provided in the procedures specified by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board in AU 722 (excluding notes that would be required

the Acquired CompaniesÂ’, as applicable, independent accountants shall have
withdrawn or announced their intention to restate their audit opinion with
respect to any of the audited financial statements of the Combined Acquired

December 31, 2013 and, if applicable, December 31, 2014, the Required

of the Combined Acquired Companies included in this definition of "Required

registration statement on Form S-3 and (B) in order for Purchaser to comply
with its obligations under the Exchange Act and its obligation to maintain the
availability of its existing shelf registration statement on Form S-3, solely
to the extent contemplated by _Section 6.18(b)(i)_ - _(viii)_ , (ii) without
limiting the requirements set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, in connection
with one or more financing transactions all or a portion of the proceeds of

not limited to providing all financial statements, financial data, audit
reports and such other financial information regarding the Acquired Companies
or the Combined Acquired Companies, as applicable, and their respective
Subsidiaries, of the type and form and within the times as customarily
provided in transactions of this type, including but not limited, financial
information as required by and in compliance with Regulation S-K and
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act for offerings on a registration
statement on Form S-3 by an accelerated filer, including all information
required to be incorporated by reference therein, and of the type and form
customarily included in documents to be used for syndication of credit
facilities and (iii) by providing assistance with the delivery of customary
consents by the

      
 

 



 

independent accountants of the Company or the Acquired Companies, as
applicable, as requested by such accountants (relating to the Combined
Acquired Companies); _provided_ , however, that failure to comply with the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.18(d)_ shall not cause any breach of
this Agreement or otherwise cause any condition to Closing set forth in
_Article 7_ to not be satisfied.

 



 

SECTION 6.19 _Post-Closing Share Consideration Matters_.

 



 

(a) If the Lockup Period expires prior to the date that is one hundred eighty
(180) days after the Closing Date, then no later than one Business Day after
the expiration of the Lockup Period, Dynegy will, if requested in writing by
Sellers no later than forty-five (45) days prior to the expiration of the
Lock-Up Period, file and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be
effective as promptly as possible thereafter either (i) a prospectus
supplement to its currently effective registration statement on Form S-3 or
(ii) a new shelf registration on Form S-3, in either case, permitting the re-
sale of the Share Consideration (the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ") in
compliance with the Securities Act. Dynegy shall, subject to normal and
customary restrictions, use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) keep the
Shelf Registration Statement effective and free of material misstatements or
omissions (including the preparation and filing of any amendments and
supplements necessary for that purpose) until the date on which the Sellers
have transferred their respective allocated portion of the Share Consideration
to third parties; provided that Dynegy shall have the right to require the
Sellers to suspend the use of the prospectus for sales of the Share
Consideration under the Shelf Registration Statement if Dynegy determines in
good faith and in its reasonable judgment that it is required to disclose in
the Shelf Registration Statement material, non-public information that Dynegy
has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential, and
immediately upon receipt of notice of such suspension, the Sellers shall
suspend the use of the prospectus until Dynegy informs Sellers that the
requisite changes to the prospectus have been made and (B) facilitate the sale
of the Share Consideration pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement upon
request by any Seller following the Lockup Period.

 



 

(b) No Seller may sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, assign or
dispose of (" _Transfer_ ") any portion of the Share Consideration prior to
the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the earlier of the
Closing Date or the date that Dynegy first closes an issuance of equity
securities intended to finance any portion of the Purchase Price or the
"Purchase Price", as such term is defined in the Brayton Point Agreement (the
" _Lockup Period_ "), other than Transfers to any Affiliate or limited partner
of such Seller which Affiliate or limited partner agrees to be bound by this
_Section 6.19(b)_. Each Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that, during the
Lockup Period, each of the certificates representing a portion of the Share
Consideration shall be subject to stop transfer instructions and shall include
an appropriate legend referencing such restrictions. Any purported or
attempted Transfer of Share Consideration by a Seller that does not comply
with this _Section 6.19_ shall be void ab initio and the purported transferee
or successor by operation of law shall not be deemed to be a stockholder of
Dynegy for any purpose and shall not be entitled to any of the rights of a
stockholder, including, without limitation, the right to vote any shares
included in the Share Consideration entitled to vote or to receive a
certificate or certificates for the Share Consideration or any dividends or
other distributions on or with respect to the Share Consideration. Dynegy
shall use commercially reasonable efforts, upon request by any Seller,

       
 

 



 

to cause the transfer agent with respect to the Share Consideration to issue
such Seller unlegended certificates representing such SellerÂ’s portion of the
Share Consideration, or cause the crediting of any such Share Consideration to
an account designated by such Seller, in each case as of or following the
expiration of the Lockup Period.

SECTION 9.01 _Indemnification by the Sellers_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the other provisions of this
_Article 9_, the Sellers agree, on a several and not joint basis (other than
with respect to any amounts in the Escrow Fund, which shall be on a joint and
several basis), to indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) and each of their respective managers, officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Purchaser Entities_ ") and to hold each of
them harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, paid or incurred
by such Indemnified Purchaser Entity (whether directly, pursuant to a Claim by
a Third Party or otherwise) (i) arising out of or related to any breach of any
of the representations and warranties made by the Sellers in _Article 3_ or
by the Company in _Article 4_, (ii) arising out of or relating to any breach
of any of the covenants or agreements of the Sellers or the Acquired Companies
contained in this Agreement ( _provided_ , that no Seller shall be responsible
for the breach by any other Seller of any covenant or agreement of such other
Seller), (iii) arising out of or relating to any Taxes of any of the Acquired
Companies (including any Taxes for which any Acquired Company is liable
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign Law)) for any Pre-Closing Period or for the portion of
any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, (iv) in respect of Transfer
Taxes for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to _Section 6.03(c)_, in
each case in _Section 9.01(a)(iii)_ and _Section 9.01(a)(iv)_ other than (w)
any Taxes attributable to a breach by Purchaser (or, following the Closing,
any of the Acquired Companies) of any of their covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, (x) any Taxes included in Closing Date Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount or otherwise taken into account in the
calculation of the final Purchase Price, (y) any Taxes arising out of any
action taken or caused to be taken by Purchaser or any of the Acquired
Companies outside the ordinary course of business on the Closing Date after
the Closing or (z) any Taxes to the extent that a net operating loss, capital
loss, Tax credit or other Tax attribute in existence as of the Closing Date
(for the avoidance of doubt, including any such loss, credit or other
attribute arising from the Transaction Tax Deductions or otherwise arising
from the Closing) is available (or would have been available if not used in a
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date) under
applicable Law to offset such Tax, or (v) in respect of the matters set forth
on Section 9.01(a)(v) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. For purposes of
_Section 9.01(a)(i)_, whether any representation or warranty (other than any
representation or warranty set forth in _Section 4.07(b)_, _Section 4.10(a)_
and _Section 4.11(a)_) has been breached, and the determination and
calculation of any Losses resulting from such breach, shall be determined
without giving effect to any qualification as to "materiality" (including the
words "material", "Seller Material Adverse Effect" or "Company Material
Adverse Effect"). For purposes of _Section 9.01(a)(iii)_ any real property,
personal property and other ad valorem Taxes assessed with respect to a
Straddle Period shall be allocated between the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning
after the Closing Date pro rata

      
 

 



 

in accordance with the number of days in each such portion, and any other
Taxes assessed with respect to a Straddle Period shall be allocated between
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the portion
of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date by means of a closing
of the books and records of the applicable Acquired Companies.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
9.01_, the Indemnified Purchaser Entities shall be entitled to
indemnification:

 



 

(i) with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.01(a)(i)_ or, except with respect to fees and disbursements of counsel and
other advisors, _Section 9.01(a)(v)_, only if the aggregate of (A) Losses to
all Indemnified Purchaser Entities with respect to all such claims and (B)
"Losses" to all "Indemnified Parent Entities" (each as defined in the Brayton
Point Agreement) with respect to claims pursuant to Section 9.01(a)(i) of the
Brayton Point Agreement exceeds $24,150,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), whereupon
(subject to the provisions of clauses (ii) and (iii) below) the Sellers shall
be obligated to pay in full all such amounts but only to the extent such
aggregate Losses and "Losses" as defined in the Brayton Point Agreement are in
excess of the amount of the Deductible; _provided_ , that the Deductible shall
not apply to any indemnification obligation of the Sellers related to the
Seller Specified Representations or the Company Specified Representations or
the representations and warranties contained in _Section 4.15_ or _Section
4.16_;

 



 

(ii) only with respect to individual items where the Losses relating thereto
are in excess of $250,000.00 (any items less than such threshold shall not be
aggregated for the purposes of the immediately preceding clause (i)); provided
that this clause (ii) shall not apply to any indemnification obligation of the
Sellers pursuant to _Section 9.01(a)(v)_; and

 



 

(iii) only if such claims are made on or before the expiration of the survival
period pursuant to _Section 8.01_ for the applicable representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall the Indemnified Purchaser Entities and "Indemnified Parent
Entities" as defined in the Brayton Point Agreement be entitled in the
aggregate to Losses and "Losses" as defined in the Brayton Point Agreement in
excess of $276,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "). Any Losses owed to any Indemnified
Purchaser Entity shall (i) first be satisfied out of any remaining funds in
the Escrow Fund and (ii) then be satisfied by the Sellers on a several but not
joint basis, in each case, subject to the Cap.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to
the extent that Losses to which an Indemnified Purchaser Entity is entitled to
indemnification hereunder also constitute an indemnifiable matter under any
Prior Acquisition Agreement, (i) such Indemnified Purchaser Entity shall, to
the extent any applicable survival period thereunder has not expired, first
bring a claim pursuant to such Prior Acquisition Agreement and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain indemnification under such Prior
Acquisition Agreement before pursuing any claim hereunder for any Losses and
(ii) any amounts recovered under such Prior Acquisition Agreement with respect
to a Loss shall

      
 

 



 

reduce, dollar for dollar, the amount owed by the Sellers hereunder;
_provided_ , that (x) any claim made or asserted by an Indemnified Purchaser
Entity under any Prior Acquisition Agreement within the applicable survival
period in this Agreement shall continue to survive with respect to such claim
until such claim is finally resolved (under both the Prior Acquisition
Agreement and this Agreement) and all obligations with respect thereto are, to
the extent resolved in favor of an Indemnified Purchaser Entity, fully
satisfied (under both the Prior Acquisition Agreement and this Agreement), and
(y) such claim made or asserted by an Indemnified Purchaser Entity under any
Prior Acquisition Agreement within the applicable survival period in this
Agreement shall be considered a Pending Claim under this Agreement until such
time as the claim is finally resolved (under both the Prior Acquisition
Agreement and this Agreement) and all obligations with respect thereto are, to
the extent resolved in favor of an Indemnified Purchaser Entity, fully
satisfied (under both the Prior Acquisition Agreement and this Agreement), or
such time as the claim is otherwise determined to be a Resolved Claim
hereunder.

 



 

(e) This _Section 9.01_ is subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
8.03(b)_.

 



 

SECTION 9.02 _Indemnification by Purchaser_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this
_Article 9_, Purchaser agrees to indemnify the Sellers and the Optionholders
and their Affiliates, and each of their respective managers, officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Seller Entities_ ") and to hold each of them
harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, paid or incurred by
any such Indemnified Seller Entity (whether directly, pursuant to a Claim by a
Third Party or otherwise) (i) arising out of or related to any breach of any
of the representations and warranties made by Purchaser or Dynegy in _Article
5_, (ii) arising out of or related to any breach of any of the covenants or
agreements of Purchaser or Dynegy contained in this Agreement or (iii) in
respect of Transfer Taxes for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to
_Section 6.03(c)_. For purposes of _Section 9.02(a)(i)_, whether any
representation or warranty has been breached, and the determination and
calculation of any Losses resulting from such breach, shall be determined
without giving effect to any qualification as to "materiality" (including the
words "material" or "material adverse effect").

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
9.02_, the Indemnified Seller Entities shall be entitled to indemnification:

 



 

(i) with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.02(a)(i)_ (other than the Fundamental Representations made by Purchaser or
Dynegy), only if the aggregate of (A) Losses to all Indemnified Seller
Entities with respect to all such claims and (B) "Losses" to all "Indemnified
Seller Entities" (each as defined in the Brayton Point Agreement) with respect
to claims pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) of the Brayton Point Agreement
exceeds the Deductible, whereupon (subject to the provisions of clauses (ii)
and (iii) below) Purchaser shall be obligated to pay in full all such amounts
but only to the extent such aggregate Losses and "Losses" as defined in the
Brayton Point Agreement are in excess of the amount of the Deductible;

      
 

 



 

(ii) only with respect to individual items where the Losses relating thereto
are in excess of $250,000.00 (any items less than such threshold shall not be
aggregated for the purposes of the immediately preceding clause (i)); and

 



 

(iii) only if such claims are made on or before the expiration of the survival
period pursuant to _Section 8.01_ for the applicable representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
no event shall the Indemnified Seller Entities and "Indemnified Seller
Entities" as defined in the Brayton Point Agreement be entitled in the
aggregate to Losses and "Losses" as defined in the Brayton Point Agreement in
excess of the Cap.

 



 

(d) This _Section 9.02_ is subject to the limitations set forth in _Section
8.03(b)_.

 



 

SECTION 9.03 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) If an Indemnified Purchaser Entity or an Indemnified Seller Entity (each,
an " _Indemnified Entity_ ") believes that a claim, demand or other
circumstance exists that has given or may reasonably be expected to give rise
to a right of indemnification under this _Article 9_ (whether or not the
amount of Losses relating thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified
Entity shall assert its claim for indemnification by giving written notice
thereof (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the party from which indemnification is
sought pursuant to _Section 9.01_ or _Section 9.02_, as applicable, and,
with respect to an Indemnified Purchaser Entity, to the Escrow Agent (the
party from which indemnification is sought, the " _Indemnifying Entity_ ") (i)
if the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim for indemnification is,
or relates to, a Claim brought by a Person not a Party or affiliated with any
such Party (a " _Third Party_ "), within ten (10) Business Days following
receipt of written notice of such Claim by such Indemnified Entity, or (ii) if
the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim for indemnification is not,
or does not relate to, a Claim brought by a Third Party, as promptly as
practicable after the discovery by the Indemnified Entity of the circumstances
giving rise to such claim for indemnity; _provided_ , that, in each case in
clauses (i) and (ii), the failure to notify or delay in notifying the
Indemnifying Entity or the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, will not relieve
the Indemnifying Entity of its obligations pursuant to this _Article 9_,
except to the extent that such Indemnifying Entity is materially prejudiced as
a result thereof. Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim and the basis of
such claim in reasonable detail.

 



 

(b) Upon receipt by an Indemnifying Entity of a Claim Notice in respect of a
Claim brought by a Third Party, the Indemnifying Entity shall be entitled to
(i) assume and have sole control over the defense of such Claim at its sole
cost and expense (subject to the last sentence of this _Section 9.03(b)_) and
with its own counsel if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the
Indemnified Entity within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice from
the Indemnified Entity; _provided_ , that (A) the Indemnifying EntityÂ’s
retention of counsel shall be subject to the written consent of the
Indemnified Entity if such counsel creates a conflict of interest under
applicable standards of professional conduct or an unreasonable risk of
disclosure of confidential information concerning an Indemnified Entity, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed and (B)
the Indemnifying Entity shall

      
 

 



 

not be entitled to assume and have control over such defense if such Claim
arises in connection with a criminal proceeding (provided, that the
Indemnifying Entity shall be entitled to participate in such defense, with
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Entity, at such Indemnifying
EntityÂ’s sole cost and expense) or if the Indemnified Entity shall have been
advised in writing by counsel that an actual conflict exists between the
Indemnified Entity and the Indemnifying Entity in connection with the defense
of such Third Party Claim; and (ii) negotiate a settlement or compromise of
such Claim; _provided_ , that unless (A) such settlement or compromise (1)
includes a full and unconditional waiver and release by the Third Party of all
applicable Indemnified Entities without any cost or liability of any nature
whatsoever to such Indemnified Entities, (2) does not involve any finding or
admission of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by the
Indemnified Entity and (3) does not result in any Lien on any of the assets
of, or contain any restriction or condition that would affect the future
conduct of, the Indemnified Entity or its Affiliates and (B) the Indemnifying
Entity shall pay or cause to be paid all amounts of such settlement or
compromise, such settlement or compromise shall be permitted hereunder only
with the written consent of the Indemnified Entity, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If, within thirty (30) days of
receipt from an Indemnified Entity of any Claim Notice with respect to a Third
Party action or claim, the Indemnifying Entity (i) advises such Indemnified
Entity in writing that the Indemnifying Entity does not elect to defend,
settle or compromise such Claim, (ii) is not entitled to assume and control
the defense of such Claim or (iii) fails to make such an election in writing,
then such Indemnified Entity may, at its option, defend, settle or otherwise
compromise or pay such Claim; _provided_ , that any such settlement or
compromise shall be permitted hereunder only with the written consent of the
Indemnifying Entity, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Each Indemnified Entity shall make available to the
Indemnifying Entity all information reasonably available to such Indemnified
Entity relating to such Claim, except as may be prohibited by applicable Law.
In addition, the Parties shall render to each other such assistance as may
reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of
any such Claim. The Party in charge of the defense shall keep the other
Parties fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any
settlement negotiations with respect thereto. If the Indemnifying Entity
elects to defend any such Claim, then the Indemnified Entity shall be entitled
to participate in such defense with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Entity at such Indemnified EntityÂ’s sole cost and expense. In the
event the Indemnifying Entity assumes the defense of (or otherwise elects to
negotiate or settle or compromise) any such Claim, the Indemnified Entity
shall reimburse the Indemnifying Entity for all costs and expenses incurred by
the Indemnifying Entity in connection with such defense (or negotiation,
settlement or compromise) to the extent, if applicable, that such costs and
expenses do not exceed the amount of the remaining Deductible; _provided_ ,
that such costs and expenses shall be included in the calculation of the
Deductible.

 



 

SECTION 9.04 _Indemnification Generally_.

 



 

(a) The amount which the Indemnifying Entity is or may be required to pay to
any Indemnified Entity, or which is or may be required to be disbursed from
the Escrow Fund in the case of an Indemnified Purchaser Entity, pursuant to
this _Article 9_ shall be reduced (retroactively, if necessary) by any
insurance proceeds, Tax benefits (such amount to be the net present value of
such Tax benefits as reasonably determined by the Parties at the time the

      
 

 



 

indemnity payment is made) or other amounts recovered by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Entity related to the related Losses. If an Indemnified Entity
shall have received the payment required by this Agreement from the
Indemnifying Entity or the Escrow Fund, in the case of an Indemnified
Purchaser Entity, in respect of Losses (including any Purchase Price
adjustment with respect to the circumstances giving rise to such payment under
this _Article 9_) and shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds or other
amounts in respect of such Losses, then such Indemnified Entity shall promptly
repay to the Indemnifying Entity a sum equal to the amount of such insurance
proceeds or other amounts actually received, or, in the case of an Indemnified
Purchaser Entity, shall promptly reimburse to the Escrow Fund (or in the event
the Escrow Fund is no longer in existence, the Sellers in accordance with the
Payout Schedule) a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds or other
amounts actually received.

 



 

(b) In addition to the requirements of _Section 9.04(a)_, each Indemnified
Entity shall be obligated in connection with any claim for indemnification
under this _Article 9_ to use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be
expected to give rise to such Losses.

 



 

(c) Subject to the rights of any Person providing insurance as contemplated by
_Section 9.04(a)_, the Indemnifying Entity shall be subrogated to any right
of action that the Indemnified Entity may have against any other Person with
respect to any matter giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(d) The indemnification provided in this _Article 9_ shall be the exclusive
post-Closing remedy available to any Party with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or
otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except in the case of willful misconduct or fraud by such Party. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each of Purchaser and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and each of the Sellers and Optionholders and their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes
of action arising from, willful misconduct or fraud) it may have against the
Sellers or the Optionholders, or the Purchaser, respectively, arising under or
based upon this Agreement, any document or certificate delivered in connection
herewith, any applicable Law (including any applicable Environmental Law) or
otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
_Article 9_).

 



 

(e) All Losses shall be determined without duplication of recovery under other
provisions of this Agreement, the Brayton Point Agreement or any of the other
document or agreement delivered in connection with this Agreement or the
Brayton Point Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the prior
sentence, if a set of facts, conditions or events constitutes a breach of more
than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to an
indemnification obligation under this _Article 9_ or under Article 9 of the
Brayton Point Agreement, only one recovery of Losses (and "Losses" as defined
in the Brayton Point Agreement) shall be allowed, and in no event shall there
be any indemnification or duplication of payments or recovery under different
provisions of this Agreement or the Brayton Point Agreement arising out of the
same facts, conditions or events.

       
 

 



 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any Indemnified Purchaser
Entity is entitled to indemnification in accordance with this _Article 9_
with respect to Losses suffered by or in connection with Elwood, the amount of
any Losses shall not be increased as a result of an increase in PurchaserÂ’s
indirect ownership interest in Elwood from its ownership as of immediately
following the Closing, and shall be calculated based on PurchaserÂ’s indirect
ownership interest in Elwood as of immediately following the Closing.

 



 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to _Section 2.05_ shall not be considered Losses for purposes of
this _Article 9_.

 



 

SECTION 9.05 _Release of Escrow Funds_.

 



 

(a) The release of Escrow Funds shall be subject to the terms of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) On the date which is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date (the "
_Release Date_ "), Sellers and Purchaser shall execute a joint instruction
directing the Escrow Agent to release promptly, but no later than two (2)
Business Days following receipt of such instruction, to each Seller the amount
equal to the portion of such SellerÂ’s share of the balance of the Escrow Fund
hereunder and under the Brayton Point Agreement as of the Release Date in
accordance with the Payout Schedule minus the amounts of any unresolved Claims
of the Indemnified Purchaser Entities or the "Indemnified Parent Entities" as
defined in the Brayton Point Agreement for indemnification properly asserted
in accordance with the terms and limitations set forth in this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement (such claims being hereinafter referred to as " _Pending
Claims_ "); provided, that all of the funds in the Escrow Fund will be
released to the Sellers on the Release Date unless the amount of all Pending
Claims is in excess of $35,000,000, in which case solely the amount of Pending
Claims in excess of $35,000,000 shall be retained in the Escrow Fund.

 



 

(c) If at any time between the Closing Date and the Release Date, any Pending
Claims by an Indemnified Purchaser Entity in respect of which amounts may have
been retained in the Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 9.05(b)_ are finally
resolved by either mutual written agreement of the Sellers and Purchaser or by
a final non-appealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or
similar judicial entity (such Claims being hereinafter referred to " _Resolved
Claims_ "), the Escrow Agent shall disburse promptly, but no later than two
(2) Business Days following receipt of such mutual written agreement or final
court determination, to the Indemnified Purchaser Entity, the aggregate
amount, if any, of such Resolved Claims (or, if less, the remaining funds in
the Escrow Fund) determined to be owing to such Indemnified Purchaser Entity.

 



 

(d) After the Release Date, at such time as any Pending Claims in respect of
which amounts may have been retained in the Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section
9.05(b)_ become Resolved Claims, the Escrow Agent shall disburse promptly, but
no later than two (2) Business Days following receipt of such final
determination, (i) to the Indemnified Purchaser Entities, the aggregate
amount, if any, of such Resolved Claims (or, if less, the remaining funds in
the Escrow Fund) determined to be owing to such Indemnified Purchaser
Entities, and (ii) to each of the Sellers, the amount equal to the portion of
such SellerÂ’s share of the Escrow Fund

      
 

 



 

in accordance with the Payout Schedule, if any, of such Resolved Claims that
was not disbursed to the Indemnified Purchaser Entities in accordance with
such final determination and the Escrow Agreement but not to exceed the
balance of the Escrow Fund as of such date _minus_ the aggregate amount of all
Pending Claims in respect of which amounts may have been retained in the
Escrow Fund pursuant to _Section 9.05(b)_ as of such date.

 



 

ARTICLE 10

 



 

 _Termination_

 



 

SECTION 10.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated:

 



 

(a) at any time prior to the Closing Date by mutual written agreement of
Purchaser and the Sellers;

 



 

(b) by either Purchaser or the Sellers if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or prior to May 8, 2015 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.01(b)_ shall not be
available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur on or before such date;

 



 

(c) by either Purchaser or the Sellers by giving written notice to the other
Party if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling
or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall not be subject
to appeal or shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.01(c)_ shall not be
available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, such order, decree, ruling or
other action;

 



 

(d) by either Purchaser or the Sellers by giving written notice to the other
Party if there has been a breach by the Purchaser or Dynegy, with respect to a
termination by the Sellers, or a breach by the Sellers or the Company, with
respect to a termination by the Purchaser, of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement and such breach (i)
would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions to the
Closing of the Party sending such notice (set forth in _Section 7.02_ or
_Section 7.03_, as applicable) and (ii), if of a character that is capable of
being cured, is not cured by the breaching Party (or ECP II-C Fund or Dynegy,
as applicable, if such party is the breaching party) within thirty (30) days
of its receipt of such written notice from the other Party; _provided_ , that
(x) Purchaser shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement if Purchaser
or Dynegy is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or other agreements contained herein and such breach would result in
the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions to the Closing set forth
in _Section 7.03_, and (y) the Sellers shall not be permitted to terminate
this Agreement if the Sellers or the Company are then in breach of any of
their representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained
herein and such breach would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of
the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 7.02_; or

      
 

 



 

(e) automatically, without any further action by the Parties, if the Brayton
Point Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 



 

SECTION 10.02 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by _Section 10.01(a)_
through _(e)_ , such termination shall be without liability of any Party (or
ECP II-C Fund or Dynegy) to the other Parties (and ECP II-C Fund and Dynegy),
except, subject to _Section 10.02(c)_, liability of any Party to the other
Parties for any intentional and willful breach of this Agreement or fraud
occurring prior to such termination.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by either Party pursuant to _Section
10.01_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated, without
further action by any Party; _provided_ , that Purchaser, at its option,
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, either (i)
return to the Sellers or (ii) destroy (and deliver a certificate to the
Sellers confirming such destruction) all Confidential Information received
from the Sellers, their respective Affiliates or their respective
Representatives or other advisors, whether so obtained before or after the
execution of this Agreement, and continue to treat all Confidential
Information in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination hereof.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Sellers pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)_ or (y) pursuant to _Section 10.01(e)_ in a situation where the
Brayton Point Agreement was terminated by the Sellers pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)_ thereof, then Dynegy shall pay to the Sellers, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within two (2) Business Days following the date of
termination, the amount of $195,000,000 (the " _Break-Up Fee_ "). Until such
time as the Sellers terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)_
or this Agreement is automatically terminated pursuant to _Section 10.01(e)_
in a situation where the Brayton Point Agreement was terminated by the Sellers
pursuant to Section 10.01(d) thereof, and Dynegy pays the Break-Up Fee in
accordance with this _Section 10.02(c)_ and the Break-Up Fee in accordance
with Section 10.02(c) of the Brayton Point Agreement, nothing in this _Section
10.02(c)_ shall prohibit the Sellers from their right to seek specific
performance pursuant to, and on the terms and conditions set forth in,
_Section 11.07_; provided, that the Sellers shall not be entitled under any
circumstances to obtain both (i) a recovery of monetary damages in the form of
the Break-Up Fee (and any amounts recoverable pursuant to _Section 10.02(d)_)
or otherwise, and (ii) specific performance of the consummation of the Closing
pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)_,
the SellersÂ’ right to receive the Break-Up Fee and the amounts due pursuant to
_Section 6.18(b)_ and _Section 10.02(d)_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Sellers and their respective Affiliates against Dynegy and its
Affiliates for any losses, liabilities, damages, obligations, payments, costs
and expenses suffered as a result of the failure of Closing of this Agreement
to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount (and any amount due under
the Brayton Point Agreement pursuant to Section 10.02 thereof), neither Dynegy
nor its Affiliates shall have any further rights, liability, or obligations
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Parties (and Dynegy) agree that (1) damages

      
 

 



 

suffered by the Sellers and the Acquired Companies in the event the Sellers
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)_ or this Agreement is
automatically terminated pursuant to _Section 10.01(e)_ in a situation where
the Brayton Point Agreement was terminated by the Sellers pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)_ thereof are incapable or very difficult to accurately estimate and
(2) the Break-Up Fee and the amounts due pursuant to _Section 6.18(b)_ and
_Section 10.02(d)_ are a reasonable forecast of just compensation for such
termination. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement.

 



 

(d) If Dynegy fails promptly to pay the Break-Up Fee, and, in order to obtain
such payment, the Sellers commence an action that results in a judgment
against Dynegy for the Break-Up Fee, Dynegy shall pay to the Sellers, together
with the Break-Up Fee, (A) interest on the Break-Up Fee from the date of
termination of this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date
of termination of this Agreement plus two percent (2%) and (B) any fees, costs
and expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the Sellers or the Company in
connection with any such action.

 



 

(e) If this Agreement is terminated, this Agreement shall become null and void
and of no further force and effect, except for the following provisions which
shall survive such termination: _Section 6.04(a)_ (Confidentiality;
Publicity); _Section 6.06_ (Expenses); this _Section 10.02_ (Effect of
Termination) and _Article 11_ (Miscellaneous).

SECTION 11.02 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is found to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, (a)
a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, to the extent valid or enforceable, such provision and (b) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in
any other jurisdiction.

 



 

SECTION 11.03 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
shall, taken together, be

      
 

 



 

considered one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed signature page
of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic image scan transmission
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 11.04 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by the Parties. Each Party may, by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party, waive compliance by
any other Party with any term or provision of this Agreement that such other
Party was or is obligated to comply with or perform. No failure or delay by
any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
power or privilege. Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights and
remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no waiver with
respect to the provisions of which any Financing Party is expressly made a
third party beneficiary pursuant to _Section 11.05_ (and the related
definitions and other provisions of this Agreement to the extent a waiver
would serve to modify the substance or provisions of such sections) shall be
permitted in a manner adverse to any Financing Party without the prior written
consent of the arrangers or lenders providing such Financing.

 



 

SECTION 11.05 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, the Brayton Point Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the letter agreement by and among Energy Capital
Partners II, LLC, Purchaser, Dynegy, Dynegy Resource III, LLC and Dynegy
Resource III-A, LLC (together with the written agreements, Schedules and
certificates referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto) constitute the
entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Except as provided in (x) _Section 6.14_, _Section 8.03(a)_ or _Article 9_
and (y) _Section 11.04_, this _Section 11.05_, _Section 11.06_, _Section
11.08_ and _Section 11.14_, which are expressly intended to benefit the
Financing Parties, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and
their permitted assigns and is not intended to confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies hereunder.

 



 

SECTION 11.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that except as specifically set
forth in the Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of action (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any Financing Party
in any way relating to any Financing or the performance thereof, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws
of the state of New York.

 



 

SECTION 11.07 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with its specific terms and that any remedy at law
for any breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be inadequate.
Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and agree that each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this

      
 

 



 

Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Notwithstanding the immediately foregoing sentence, it is explicitly agreed
that the right of the Sellers and the Company to seek specific performance or
other equitable remedies to enforce PurchaserÂ’s obligation to consummate the
sale and purchase of the Shares and DynegyÂ’s obligation to issue the Share
Consideration (but not the right of the Sellers or the Company to specific
performance or other equitable remedies for obligations other than PurchaserÂ’s
obligation to consummate the sale and purchase of the Shares and DynegyÂ’s
obligation to issue the Share Consideration) shall be subject to the
requirements that (i) all of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section
7.01_ and _Section 7.02_ were satisfied (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at Closing), (ii) the then-
applicable Marketing Period has been satisfied, (iii) the Financing has been
funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance
with the terms thereof at the Closing if Purchaser delivers notice to the
Financing Sources thereunder and (iv) the Sellers and the Company have
confirmed that if the Financing is funded, then they would take such actions
that are within their control to cause the Closing to occur. For the avoidance
of doubt, without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.18(a)_, it is hereby
acknowledged and agreed that (i) the Sellers and the Company shall be entitled
to seek specific performance to cause Purchaser to enforce, including against
anticipatory breach, the obligations of the Financing Sources to fund the
Financing under the Financing Documents and (ii) in the event that any of the
Financing Sources initiate litigation against Purchaser with respect to the
Financing, or advise Purchaser that they intend not to proceed with the
Financing in violation of the terms of the Financing Documents, the Sellers
and the Company shall be entitled to specific performance to require Purchaser
to take enforcement action, including seeking specific performance, to cause
such lenders to provide such Financing. Each Party agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the
basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 11.07_
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
any such injunction.

 



 

SECTION 11.08 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the
Parties hereto (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Court of Chancery or any Federal court located in the State of
Delaware, for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out
of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby and (ii) irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York (or any appellate court
therefrom), for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding against
any Financing Party arising out of the Financing or the performance thereof.
Each of the Parties hereto further agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. certified mail to such PartyÂ’s respective
address set forth in _Section 11.01_ shall be effective service of process
for any action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to
which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately
preceding sentence. Each of the Parties hereto (i) irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in (a) the Delaware Court

      
 

 



 

of Chancery or (b) any Federal court located in the State of Delaware, and
hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead
or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and (ii) irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding against any Financing Party arising out of the Financing or
the performance thereof in any state or federal court sitting in the Borough
of Manhattan in the City of New York (or any appellate court therefrom), and,
in each case, hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees
not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE
FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF).

 



 

SECTION 11.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties hereto, without
the prior written consent of each of the other Parties. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of the terms of this
_Section 11.09_ shall be null and void, _ab initio_.

 



 

SECTION 11.10 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 11.11 _Schedules and Exhibits_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are intended to be
and hereby are made a part of this Agreement. Any disclosure in the Company
Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule corresponding to and
qualifying a specific numbered paragraph or section hereof shall be deemed to
correspond to and qualify any other numbered paragraph or section relating to
such Party to the extent the applicability to such other numbered paragraph or
section is reasonably apparent from such disclosure. Certain information set
forth in the Schedules is included solely for informational purposes and is
not an admission of liability with respect to the matters covered by the
information. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item
in the Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts (or higher or
lower amounts) are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any such item in the
Schedules in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item, or matter not described herein or included in a Schedule is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 11.12 _Acknowledgement and Waiver_.

 



 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto that the Sellers and the
Company have retained Latham and Watkins LLP (" _L andW_") to act as their counsel
in connection

      
 

 



 

with the transactions contemplated hereby and that LandW has not acted as
counsel for any other Person in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby for conflict of interest or any other purposes. Purchaser and the
Company agree that any attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence attaching as a result of LandWÂ’s representation of the Sellers and
the Company related to the preparation for, and negotiation and consummation
of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all
communications among LandW and the Sellers, the Company and/or their respective
Affiliates in preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall survive the Closing and
shall remain in effect. Furthermore, effective as of the Closing, (i) all
communications (and materials relating thereto) between the Acquired Companies
and LandW related to the preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are hereby assigned and
transferred to the Sellers, (ii) the Acquired Companies hereby release all of
their respective rights and interests to and in such communications and
related materials and (iii) the Acquired Companies hereby release any right to
assert or waive any privilege related to such communications, and (iv) the
Acquired Companies acknowledge and agree that all such rights shall reside
with the Sellers.

 



 

(b) Purchaser and the Company agree that, notwithstanding any current or prior
representation of the Acquired Companies by LandW, LandW shall be allowed to
represent the Sellers, the Optionholders or any of their respective Affiliates
in any matters and disputes adverse to Purchaser and/or the Acquired Companies
that either is existing on the date hereof or arises in the future and relates
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; and the Purchaser
and the Company hereby waive any conflicts or claim of privilege that may
arise in connection with such representation. Further, Purchaser and the
Company agree that, in the event that a dispute arises after Closing between
Purchaser or the Company and any Seller, any Optionholder or any of their
respective Affiliates, LandW may represent such Seller, Optionholder or
Affiliate in such dispute even though the interests of such Seller,
Optionholder or Affiliate may be directly adverse to Purchaser or the Company
and even though LandW may have represented an Acquired Company in a matter
substantially related to such dispute.

 



 

(c) Purchaser acknowledges that any advice given to or communication with any
Seller, any Optionholder or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies) shall not be subject to any joint privilege and shall be
owned solely by such Seller, Optionholder or Affiliate. Purchaser and the
Company each hereby acknowledge that each of them have had the opportunity to
discuss and obtain adequate information concerning the significance and
material risks of, and reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers,
permissions and other provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity
to consult with counsel other than LandW.

 



 

SECTION 11.13 _Obligations of ECP II-C_. ECP II-C Fund agrees to be liable for
the performance by ECP II-C of all of ECP II-CÂ’s obligations under this
Agreement. The foregoing obligation of ECP II-C Fund under this _Section
11.13_ is absolute and unconditional. If ECP II-C fails to pay or perform any
obligation under this Agreement as and when due, ECP II-C Fund will, promptly
on written demand thereof by Purchaser, pay or perform same. ECP II-C Fund
hereby waives any and all rights and remedies that it may have as a guarantor
or surety or to otherwise seek to take defenses outside of this Agreement
(that are not otherwise available to ECP II-C) that may limit or delay
PurchaserÂ’s recovery hereunder. ECP II-C Fund represents

      
 

 



 

and warrants to Purchaser, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date,
as follows: (a) ECP II-C Fund is a limited partnership, organized under the
laws of Delaware, and has all requisite power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (b) ECP II-C
Fund is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its jurisdiction of organization; (c) the execution, delivery and
performance by ECP II-C Fund of this Agreement, and the consummation by ECP
II-C Fund of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized
by all necessary limited partnership action on the part of ECP II-C Fund; (d)
this Agreement has been duly executed by ECP II-C Fund; and (e) this Agreement
constitutes (assuming the due execution and delivery by each other party
hereto) a valid and legally binding obligation of ECP II-C Fund, enforceable
against ECP II-C Fund in accordance with its terms, subject in all respects to
the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditorsÂ’ rights generally
and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law).

 



 

SECTION 11.14 _Financing-Related Arrangements_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the maximum liability of the Financing Parties
to the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates relating to this
Agreement, any related documentation or any of the transactions contemplated
herein or therein shall be the Break-Up Fee. This _Section 11.14_ is intended
to benefit and may be enforced by any Financing Party and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of each Seller.

 



 

[SIGNATURE PAGES FOLLOW.]

       
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties, ECP II-C Fund and Dynegy have caused this
Agreement to be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.
