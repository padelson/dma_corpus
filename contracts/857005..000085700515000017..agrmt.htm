Securityholder Representative a statement of Net Working Capital, Unrestricted
Cash, Transaction Expenses and Company Debt of the Company as of 11:59 PM

Securityholder Representative's reasonable request all records and work papers

calculating such amounts. If the Securityholder Representative disagrees with
either the Post-Closing Company Debt Calculation, the Post-Closing Net Working

Post-Closing Transaction Expense Calculation, the Securityholder
Representative may provide a written notice of proposed changes to any such

receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement (and in the event no Change
Notice is provided during such period, the Securityholder Representative will
be deemed to have agreed to and accepted each such calculation as of the end
of such period). Buyer shall promptly cooperate with the Securityholder
Representative in providing such information as the Securityholder
Representative reasonably requests in connection with the review of the

(ii) Based on the foregoing:

  

  

(A) the following amount (the "Final WC Adjustment Amount") shall be
determined equal to the sum of (A) the Company Debt, as finally determined, as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time minus the Company Debt Payoff
Amount, plus (B) if the Net Working Capital Deficiency, if any, would have
been a greater positive amount based on the Net Working Capital as finally
determined, the amount of such change in the Net Working Capital Deficiency,
plus (C) the amount by which the Transaction Expenses are greater than the
Transaction Expenses specified in the Allocation Certificate, plus (D) the
employer portion of employment taxes with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable at Closing in respect of the Company Phantom Units as finally
determined minus that amount included in the Allocation Certificate in respect
thereof, plus (E) the amount by which the Change in Control Payments, if any,
are greater than the Change in Control Payments specified in the Allocation
Certificate. If the Final WC Adjustment Amount is a positive number, Buyer
shall be entitled to receive from the Escrow Amount such Final WC Adjustment
Amount. In such event, Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall
execute

and deliver to the Escrow Agent disbursement instructions for the Final WC
Adjustment Amount in accordance with the Escrow Agreement; and

  

  

(B) if the Dividend Prepayment amount was more than one-half of the
Unrestricted Cash, as finally determined, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Buyer shall be entitled to receive from the Escrow Amount an
amount equal to the amount by which the Dividend Prepayment was more than one-
half of the Unrestricted Cash, as finally determined, as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the "Cash Shortfall"). In such event, Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent
disbursement instructions for the Cash Shortfall in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

(d) Resolution of Disputes. Buyer and the Securityholder Representative will
attempt in good faith promptly to resolve any differences with respect to the
calculations under Section 1.7(c) (Post-Closing True-Up) that are raised
within the applicable period. If Buyer and the Securityholder Representative
resolve their disagreement, they shall set forth the agreement in a written
document executed by Buyer and the Securityholder Representative and such
written document shall be deemed final and binding for all purposes of this
Agreement. If they are unable to resolve any differences within thirty (30)
days after timely delivery of an applicable Change Notice, such remaining
differences will be submitted to the Independent Accountant for prompt
determination. The Independent Accountant will determine those matters in
dispute and will render a written report as to the disputed matters, which
report shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses
of the Independent Accountant shall initially be borne fifty percent (50%) by
the Escrow Participants and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer; provided that upon
resolution of the dispute by the Independent Accountant, the prevailing party,
if any, as determined by the Independent Accountant, shall be entitled to be
reimbursed in proportion to the amount by which the other party's
determinations of the items in dispute differed from the amount determined by
the Independent Accountant. Such amount shall be determined by the Independent
Accountant. Any fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant to be paid by
the Escrow Participants will be paid out of the Escrow Amount, and Buyer and
the Securityholder Representative shall execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent disbursement instructions for the amount of such fees and expenses to be
paid by the Escrow Participants from the Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

(e) No Impairment of Other Rights. The Allocation Certificate (and the
agreement thereto) and the determination of the Final WC Adjustment Amount
under this Section 1.7 shall not impair any other rights of a party under this

(f) Purchase Price Allocation.

  

  

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Securityholder Representative shall prepare and forward to Buyer
a draft allocation of the Merger Consideration, the Liabilities of the Company
as of 11:59 PM Eastern time on the Closing Date (to the extent required to be
taken into account under applicable Law), and other relevant items among the
assets of the Company, based on the fair market value of such assets
immediately prior to the Closing and consistent with Sections 751 and 1060 of
the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any
analogous provisions of state, local or non-U.S. law) (the "Draft
Allocation").

  

  

(ii) If Buyer disagrees with the Draft Allocation, Buyer may provide a written
notice of proposed changes to the Draft Allocation specifying in reasonable
detail all disputed items and the basis therefor (an "Allocation Change
Notice") to the Securityholder Representative

within forty-five (45) days after the receipt of the Draft Allocation (and in
the event no Allocation Change Notice is provided during such period, Buyer
will be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the Draft Allocation as of the
end of such period). Buyer shall promptly cooperate with the Securityholder
Representative in providing such information as the Securityholder
Representative reasonably requests in connection with the review of the
Allocation Change Notice. If Buyer provides an Allocation Change Notice to the
Securityholder Representative within such period, any disagreements with
respect to the Draft Allocation shall be finally determined in accordance with
the principles set forth in Section 1.7(d) (Resolution of Disputes).

  

  

(iii) Upon resolution of all disputes with respect to the Draft Allocation,
the Draft Allocation shall become final (the "Final Allocation"). Buyer, the
Securityholders, Securityholder Representative, the Surviving LLC and the
respective Affiliates of each of them shall report, act and file all Tax
Returns (including, but not limited to Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in
all respects and for all purposes consistent with the Final Allocation. None
of Buyer, the Securityholders, the Company, the Securityholder Representative,
Parent nor Surviving LLC shall take any position in any audit, investigation,
claim, proceeding or other matter related to Taxes, or on any financial
statement for accounting purposes, that is inconsistent with the Final
Allocation unless required to do so pursuant to a final determination within
the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, or any analogous provision of
applicable state, local or foreign Law.

  

  

(iv) The parties hereto agree that $50,000 shall be allocated to any covenants
not to compete in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and the Final
Allocation shall reflect such agreement.

  

  

1.8 Earn-Out

  

  

The following provisions shall apply with respect to the Earn-Out
Consideration, if any.

  

  

(a) Calculation of Earn-Out. The amount of the Earn-Out Consideration, if any,
shall be calculated in accordance with and pursuant to Schedule 1.8 hereto. As
soon as practical following the conclusion of each Half-Anniversary of the
Closing Date, and in any event not later than thirty (30) days after each such
concluding dates, Buyer shall prepare a calculation of the amount of the Earn-
Out Consideration (the "Earn-Out Calculation"), if any, payable with respect
to such six-month period, and shall deliver a copy of the Earn-Out Calculation
with reasonable back-up data and a statement showing the method of computing
the applicable Earn-Out Consideration, if any, to the Securityholder
Representative. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
Milestone has been submitted prior to the applicable Deadline but has not, in
accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1.8, been Accepted by the Deadline
the amount of Earn-Out Consideration allocable to such Milestone shall be
deemed to be earned in the six-month period in which it is Accepted.

  

  

(b) Earn-Out Consideration Disputes. If the Securityholder Representative
disagrees with the Earn-Out Calculation, the Securityholder Representative
shall notify Buyer in writing in reasonable detail of the disagreement and the
basis therefor within thirty (30) days after receipt of such Earn-Out
Calculation (the "Earn-Out Objection"). If the Earn-Out Objection is not
received by Buyer within such period, the Earn-Out Calculation prepared by
Buyer shall be deemed final and binding for all purposes of this Agreement and
the amount of any Earn-Out Consideration shall be paid by Buyer within five
(5) Business Days following such thirty (30) day period. If Buyer does receive
an Earn-Out Objection within such period, Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative shall attempt in good faith to promptly resolve any differences
within thirty (30) days after timely delivery of an Earn-Out Objection. If
Buyer and the Securityholder Representative resolve their disagreement, they
shall set forth the agreement in a written document executed by Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative and such written document shall be deemed final
and binding for all purposes of this Agreement. If Buyer and the

Securityholder Representative are unable to resolve their disagreement within

of the arbitration shall initially be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Escrow
Participants and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer; provided that upon resolution
of the dispute, the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the
arbitrators, shall be entitled to be reimbursed in proportion to the amount by
which the other party's determinations of the items in dispute differed from
the amount determined by the arbitrators. Such amount shall be determined by
the arbitrators. Any fees and expenses of the arbitrators to be paid by the
Escrow Participants will first be paid out of the Escrow Amount, and Buyer and
the Securityholder Representative shall execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent disbursement instructions for the amount of such fees and expenses to be
paid by the Escrow Participants from the Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. Any Earn-Out Consideration as finally determined by the arbitrators

Journal on such date, or the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law.

($1,250,000) per six-month period; provided, further, that any amount which

or cause the Paying Agent to send to each holder of record of a Certificate
representing outstanding Class A Units, Class B Units and Preferred Units, a

Units, Class B Units or Preferred Units who has submitted a Unitholder Letter
of Transmittal duly executed, and the related Certificates prior to the

wire transfer, as soon as practicable but in any event within one (1) Business
Day after the Effective Time, and for all other holders, within two (2)
Business Days following receipt by the Paying Agent of a Unitholder Letter of
Transmittal duly executed, and the related Certificates.

  

  

(c) Certificate Lost, Stolen or Destroyed. In the event that any Company

shall issue or cause to be issued the respective Merger Consideration in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Warrant or Certificate
only following (i) delivery by the holder thereof of an affidavit of that fact
and such indemnities against any claim that may be made against Buyer, the
Surviving LLC, the Escrow Agent or the Paying Agent with respect to the
Company Warrant or Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed
as are acceptable to Buyer or otherwise required by the Paying Agent, and (ii)
in the sole discretion of Buyer or otherwise required by the Paying Agent,
delivery of a non-refundable bond in such amount as Buyer or the Paying Agent
may reasonably direct.

  

  

(d) Return of Funds from Paying Agent. Any portion of amounts deposited with
the Paying Agent that remain undistributed to the Securityholders twelve (12)
months after their deposit with the Paying Agent shall, at the request of the
Surviving LLC, be delivered to the Surviving LLC or otherwise according to the
instruction of the Surviving LLC, and any Securityholders shall thereafter

only to the Surviving LLC solely as general creditors for the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.9 (Effect of the Merger). To the extent
permitted under applicable Law, any such amounts deposited with the Paying
Agent remaining unclaimed by Securityholders immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity shall become the property of the Surviving LLC free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(e) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this SECTION 1,
none of the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent, Parent, Buyer, the Surviving LLC,
the Securityholder Representative or any party hereto shall be liable to any
Person for any amount properly paid to a public official in compliance with
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

1.12 Tax Withholding; Treatment of Additional Payments. Buyer, Parent, the
Company, the Surviving LLC, the Paying Agent, or the Escrow Agent, as the case
may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, in respect of the Company
Warrants or Company Phantom Units, the Letters of Transmittal or any Ancillary
Agreement, to or for the benefit of any Person such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld and, to the extent required by applicable
law, timely remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted or
withheld and/or remitted amounts shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. The Company, Buyer, Parent, the Surviving
LLC, the Securityholder Representative and the Securityholders agree to treat
any adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.7(c) (Post-
Closing True-Up), if any, as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all
Tax purposes and shall take no position contrary thereto (whether on any Tax
Return, or in any audit, claim, investigation, inquiry or other proceeding in
respect of Taxes) unless required to do so pursuant to a final determination
as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code, or any analogous provision of
applicable state, local or foreign Law.

  

  

1.13 Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to vest the Surviving LLC with full right,
title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Buyer, the officers and directors from time to
time of the Surviving LLC are fully authorized in the name of the Company and
Buyer, as the case may be, or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action as is consistent with this Agreement.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE COMPANY

  

  

Subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in the disclosure schedule dated
as of the Agreement Date and delivered herewith by the Company to Buyer (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule") corresponding to the applicable section and
subsection or clause of this Agreement (or disclosed in any other section,
subsection or clause of the Company Disclosure Schedule provided that a cross-
reference is provided or it is reasonably apparent upon a reading of such
disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other sections,
subsections and clauses), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent
and Buyer as follows:

  

  

2.1 Organization and Qualification. The Company is a limited liability company
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation or organization, and has full limited liability

duly qualified or otherwise authorized to transact business as a foreign
limited liability company in each jurisdiction (in the United States and
outside of the United States) in which such qualification or authorization is
required by Law, except where the failure to be so qualified or authorized,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.
The Company has made all limited liability company filings. For clarity,
limited liability company filings do not include Tax Returns. Schedule 2.1 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule lists every state or foreign jurisdiction in
which the Company has facilities, maintains an office, branch or permanent
establishment or has a current Employee, consultant or independent contractor.
The Company has not conducted any business under or otherwise used, for any
purpose or in any jurisdiction, any fictitious name, assumed name, trade name
or other name.

  

  

2.2 Capitalization; No Subsidiaries.

  

  

(a) Company Capital Structure. The authorized membership interests of the
Company consist of (i) 971,185 Preferred Units, of which all are issued and

outstanding, (iii) 288,042 Class B Units, of which all are issued and

designated, issued or outstanding, and no Equity Interests are held in the
treasury of the Company. The outstanding Equity Interests are held of record
and beneficially by the persons and in the respective amounts set forth in
Schedule 2.2(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. All of the issued and
outstanding Equity Interests have been duly authorized and validly issued, are
fully paid and nonassessable, and were issued free of (or pursuant to
effective waivers of) pre-emptive or similar rights of any party, whether
created by statute, the Company Certificate of Formation or the Company
Operating Agreement or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company
is a party, and are owned by the respective holders free and clear of any
Liens. None of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests has been issued in
violation of the Securities Act or of any other federal, state or foreign Law.
Except as set forth in Schedule 2.2(a)(ii), there are no registration rights
agreements or, to the Company's Knowledge, any stockholder agreements, voting
trusts or agreements, proxies or other agreements, instruments or
understandings with respect to any Equity Interests of the Company, except for
the Company Operating Agreement. The holders of the Company Securities and any
Purchase Rights with respect to any of the foregoing have been or will be
properly given or shall have properly waived any required notice prior to the
Closing. All preferential rights of the Equity Interests of the Company in
connection with the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, a
merger or any other change in control transaction (including a deemed
liquidation or dissolution) involving the Company are set forth in the Company
Operating Agreement. As of the Agreement Date, the Aggregate Preferred
Dividends payable in respect of all outstanding Preferred Units is
$1,181,369.86.

  

  

(b) Purchase Rights; Convertible Securities. Except as set forth in Schedule
2.2(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (which lists the respective
holders, the numbers of underlying units, the grant dates, the vesting
schedule, and the exercise price, if applicable), there are no and there have
never been any outstanding rights, subscriptions, phantom stock rights, unit
appreciation rights, warrants, calls, preemptive rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities, options or other agreements or commitments of any
kind to purchase or otherwise to receive from the Company, currently or after
the passage of time or occurrence of any other event, any of the outstanding,
authorized but unissued, unauthorized or treasury units of the Company
Securities or any other security of the Company or any right to Merger
Consideration (collectively, "Purchase Rights"). The Company has previously
Made Available to Parent true and correct copies of all the agreements and
other instruments with respect to its outstanding Purchase Rights. No Purchase
Right has been repurchased, redeemed, terminated or forfeited other than for
no consideration pursuant to its terms. The Intel Warrant is exercisable for
11,700 Class A Units and no customer introductions have been made by Intel
which would cause the vesting of additional Class A Units in accordance with
the terms of the Intel Warrant.

rights generally and by general equitable principles.

U.S. federal and applicable state, local and foreign income Tax purposes for
all taxable periods of its existence.

  

  

(b) All Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the Company

Company is not currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within which
to file any Tax Return. No claim has ever been made in writing by any taxing
authority in any jurisdiction in which the Company does not file that the
Company is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

  

  

(c) All Taxes required to be withheld, collected or deposited by or with
respect to Company in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, supplier, member, shareholder or other
Person, have been timely withheld, collected or deposited as the case may be,
and to the extent required, have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.

  

  

(d) No audit, claim, investigation, proceeding or other similar examination in
respect of Taxes is currently pending. The Company has not received any
written notice from any taxing authority that an audit or other review is
forthcoming, and, to the Company's Knowledge, no such audit or review is
pending or threatened. No deficiency for any Taxes has been asserted,
proposed, or threatened, in each case, in writing, against the Company, which
deficiency has not been paid in full. The Company has not participated or
engaged in any "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6011-4 or any corresponding or similar provision of

States federal, state and local, and all foreign income Tax Returns filed with
respect to the Company, and indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited
or subject to similar examination by a taxing authority and those Tax Returns
that currently are the subject of audit or such examination. There are no
outstanding agreements, waivers or arrangements extending the statutory period
of limitation (or any other period during which any Tax can be assessed)
applicable to any claim for, or the period for the collection, payment or
assessment of, Taxes due from or with respect to the Company for any taxable
period, and no closing agreement (within the meaning of Section 7121 of the
Code) relating to the Taxes of the Company is currently in force. The Company
has Made Available to Parent the true, complete and correct copies of all Tax
Returns of the Company for which the statute of limitations has not expired,
and all audit reports and statements of deficiencies for each of the last
three taxable years filed by or issued to or with respect to the Company (or,
insofar as such items relate to the Company, by or to any affiliated,
consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which the Company was then a
member).

  

  

(f) The unpaid Taxes of the Company for all taxable periods (or portions
thereof) ending (i) on or before the Interim Balance Sheet Date did not, as of
such date, exceed the reserve for tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the Interim Balance Sheet (rather than in any
notes thereof) and (ii) on or before the Closing Date will not, as of the
Closing Date, exceed that reserve as adjusted to reflect the ordinary
operations of the Company after the Interim Balance Sheet Date and through the
Closing Date and the Transactions in accordance with the past customs and
practice of the Company in filing its Tax Returns.

  

  

(g) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.10(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, no payment to any holder of a Company Security of any portion of
the consideration payable hereunder will result in compensation or other
income to such person with respect to which Parent, Buyer, the Escrow Agent or
the Surviving LLC would be required to deduct or withhold any Tax.

  

  

(h) The Company has never been a party to or bound by, nor does it have or has
it ever had any obligation under, any Tax allocation or sharing agreement or
similar contract or arrangement under which the Company agrees to indemnify
any party for Tax liabilities or to share or assume the Tax liability of any
party, other than agreements entered into in the ordinary course the primary
subject matter of which is not Taxes. The Company has no liability for the
Taxes of any other Person under U.S.

required for the conduct of the Business as presently conducted or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, as currently contemplated to be conducted or to hold

officers in their capacities as such or that in any manner challenges or seeks
to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay any of the Transactions. To the Company's
Knowledge, there is no fact, event or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any suit, action, claim, investigation or proceeding
which individually or in the aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect.

not conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or result in any release

other information regarding the Company as Parent and Buyer or their legal
counsel and other representatives may from time to time reasonably request.

reasonably be expected to result in competitive harm to it if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement were not consummated, (y) violate the
maintenance of attorney-client or other legal privileges or doctrines or (iii)
be in violation of applicable Law. Each of Buyer and Parent will hold and will
cause its representatives and Affiliates to hold in confidence all documents

copies of such members' consents to Parent (the "Member Consent"). The Company
shall take all action as required under all applicable Laws and the Company
Operating Agreement to give notice of and provide other appropriate documents
to the Members whose approval was not obtained as described in this Section
4.3(a). The Member Consents shall specify that adoption of this Agreement and
the Company Operating Agreement Amendment shall constitute approval by the
Members of: (i) the escrow and indemnification obligations of such
Securityholders set forth in SECTION 1 and SECTION 11 hereof and the deposit
of the Escrow Amount with the Escrow Agreement and (ii) the appointment of
Cedar Holder Representative, LLC as the Securityholder Representative, with

did not deliver a Member Consent, pursuant to and in accordance with LLC Act
and the Company Operating Agreement; and (ii) provide a summary description of
this Agreement, the Company Operating Agreement Amendment and the
Transactions, including the obligations of the Securityholders hereunder. The

(b) The Company will use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
Required Consents and the consents set forth on Schedule 4.4(b), it being

(c) Should any Person require as a condition to it consenting to the
Transactions or otherwise providing a Required Consent, (i) the amendment,
modification or replacement of any material term of any authorization,
certification, franchise, license, permit or contract, or (ii) any new
material terms to any authorization, certification, franchise, license, permit
or contract, the Company shall not agree to the same without the prior written
approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Any fee or other cost required to be incurred to
obtain any Required Consent shall be borne by the Company or, if required to
paid after the Closing, the Escrow Participants.

  

  

4.5 Nonsolicitation.

  

  

(a) Until the earlier of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the date of
termination of this Agreement, none of the Company nor any of its respective
managers, members, Employees, unit holders, Affiliates, financial advisors or
representatives (collectively, the "Representatives") shall, directly or
indirectly, take any of the following actions with any Person other than
Parent, Buyer and their designees: (i) solicit, initiate, entertain or agree
to any proposals or offers from any Person relating to (A) any merger, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, consolidation or similar
transaction involving the Company, (B) the acquisition of beneficial ownership
of any equity or ownership interest in the Company, whether by issuance by the
Company or by purchase (through a tender offer, exchange offer, negotiated
purchase or otherwise) from any Securityholder or otherwise, (C) the license
or transfer of all or a material portion of the assets of the Company, or (D)
any transaction that may be inconsistent with or that may have an adverse
effect upon the Transactions (any of the transactions described in clauses (A)
through (D), a "Third-Party Acquisition"), or (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with, facilitate or
knowingly encourage any effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek, a
Third-Party Acquisition.

  

  

(b) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date of termination of
this Agreement, if the Company or any Representative receives an inquiry,
proposal or offer relating to a Third-Party Acquisition from any Person, each
of the Company and such party shall (i) promptly notify Parent of the same and
the details thereof (including the identity of the Person making same) and the
Company shall be permitted to provide a response without breaching this
Section 4.5; provided that the response is limited to informing the initiator
of such inquiry, proposal or offer that the Company is unable to respond
further at this time, (ii) provide to Parent a copy of any written inquiry,
proposal or offer and all correspondence related thereto, and (iii) keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status thereof.

  

  

4.6 Confidentiality; Non-Disparagement; Potential Buyers.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall abide by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. At all times following the Closing, no member of
the Company Board or Member, other than any Member owning less than two
percent (2%) of the Company Securities who is not also a current Employee of
the Company, (a "Key Holder") shall:

  

  

(i) directly or indirectly, disclose, divulge or make use of any trade secrets
or other information of a business, financial, marketing, technical or other
nature pertaining to Buyer, the Surviving LLC, the Company, or the Business,
including information of others that Parent, Buyer, the Surviving LLC, the
Company has agreed to keep confidential, except (i) to the extent that such
information shall have become public knowledge other than by breach of this
Agreement by any of the Key Holders, (ii) as required in connection with the
performance of such Key Holder's duties as an employee of the Surviving LLC,
if applicable, and (iii) to the extent that disclosure of such information is
required by law or legal process (but only after the Key Holder

has provided the Company with reasonable notice and opportunity to take action
against any legally required disclosure); or

  

  

(ii) make any disparaging statements regarding the Company, the Surviving LLC,
Parent, any of their respective Affiliates or the Business.

  

  

(b) The Company shall prepare a written notice to each Potential Buyer in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, which shall include a request
for such Potential Buyer to immediately destroy or return to the Company any
confidential information of the Company, for distribution immediately
following the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be
required to disclose the identity of any Potential Buyer to Parent or Buyer
prior to the Closing.

  

  

4.7 Injunctive Relief. The Company acknowledges that any breach or threatened
breach of the provisions of Section 4.5 (Nonsolicitation) or Section 4.6
(Confidentiality; Non-Disparagement; Potential Buyers) of this Agreement will
cause irreparable injury to Parent, Buyer, the Surviving LLC and/or the
Company for which an adequate monetary remedy does not exist. Accordingly, in
the event of any such breach or threatened breach, Parent and Buyer (in the
case of Section 4.5 (Nonsolicitation)) and Parent, Buyer, the Surviving LLC
and/or the Company (in the case of Section 4.6 (Confidentiality; Non-
Disparagement; Potential Buyers)) shall be entitled, in addition to the
exercise of other remedies, to seek and (subject to court approval) obtain
injunctive and other equitable relief, without necessity of posting a bond,
restraining the Company from committing such breach or threatened breach. The
right provided under this Section 4.7 shall be in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other rights and remedies available to Parent, Buyer, the Surviving
LLC or the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation of the restrictions set forth above by the Company or by any of its
respective Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by
the Company.

  

  

4.8 Public Disclosure. Except as contemplated by this Agreement or as
otherwise required by Law (including applicable securities Laws) or, with
respect to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, by regulatory authority, listing
agreement or court order, no disclosure (whether or not in response to an
inquiry) of the existence or subject matter of this Agreement shall be made by
any party hereto (including any third-party representatives of Parent, Buyer,
the Company or any of its respective Affiliates) (other than any filing by
Parent or any of its Affiliates with the Securities and Exchange Commission or
other Governmental Entity as required by applicable Law or any communications
with any Securityholder and third parties to obtain the consents and approvals
required under this Agreement and applicable Law), whether before or after the
Closing, unless approved by Parent and the Company prior to release; provided
that such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided, further that in no event shall any party or Representative make any
such disclosure prior to Parent issuing a press release publicly announcing
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in the
event that either Parent (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Company (or any of
its respective Affiliates) is required by Law or any listing or trading
agreement to make any such disclosure, such party shall notify the other prior
to making such disclosure and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
give the other an opportunity (as is reasonable under the circumstances) to
comment on such disclosure.

  

  

4.9 Termination of Company Equity Plan and Company Warrants. The Company will
use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for the termination of (i) the
Company Equity Plan, (ii) all Company Phantom Units, and (iii) all Company
Warrants, contingent upon the Closing and automatically effective as of the
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including delivery of all applicable
Letters of Transmittal in respect thereof.

  

  

4.10 Company Operating Agreement Amendment. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Operating Agreement Amendment

to be duly authorized and approved by the Members in compliance with the
Company's Operating Agreement and the LLC Act, so that it is in full force and
effect under the LLC Act prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

4.11 Resignation of Officers and Directors. The Company shall obtain the
resignations of all members of the Company Board and all officers of the
Company effective as of the Closing.

  

  

SECTION 5

  

  


 

  

  

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND BUYER

  

  

5.1 Representations and Warranties. Until the earlier of the Effective Time
and termination of this Agreement, neither of Parent or Buyer will take any
action that would cause any of the representations and warranties made by
Parent or Buyer in this Agreement not to be true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same force and effect as if
such representations and warranties had been made on and as of the Closing
Date.

  

  

5.2 Efforts. Pending the Closing, each of Parent and Buyer will use all
reasonable efforts to cause the conditions specified in SECTION 8 (Conditions
to Each Party's Obligation to Close) and SECTION 10 (Conditions to Company's
Obligation to Close) to be satisfied as soon as practicable.

  

  

5.3 Confidentiality; Non-Disparagement. Prior to the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, each of Parent and Buyer
shall abide by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and refrain from
publicly making any disparaging statements regarding the Company and any of
its Affiliates or the Business.

  

  

5.4 Director and Officer Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Parent agrees that, for a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, (i) all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or
has been at any time prior to the Agreement Date or who becomes prior to the
Closing Date, an officer or director of the Company, as provided in the
Company Operating Agreement and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, and
solely in their capacity as such (and not as a Securityholder) (the "Company
Indemnitees"), in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms,
and (ii) the Surviving LLC or its successor shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving LLC or its successor to, fulfill and honor in all respects all such
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the
Company in favor of the Company Indemnitees described above in clause (i) of
this Section 5.4(a).

  

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a fully prepaid "tail"
policy under the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy, which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, (ii) covers only those persons who are currently covered by
the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in
effect as of the date of this Agreement and only for matters occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains coverage terms comparable to
those applicable to the current directors and officers of the Company (the
"Company DandO Tail Policy"). The entire cost of the Company DandO Tail Policy,
including any and all premiums, expenses, fees and other costs, will be
treated as a Transaction Expense hereunder. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver to Parent evidence of the amount of all such costs, including a
statement from the insurance carrier that such costs represent any and all
costs due or to become due in connection with such Company DandO Tail Policy. If
the Merger is consummated, then Parent shall maintain the Company DandO Tail
Policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations

thereunder, provided the obligations contained in this sentence shall not
require Parent to incur any expenses in connection therewith.

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.4 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnitees and their respective
heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns. No party to this
Agreement shall take any action as to materially and adversely affect any
Company Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.4 applies without the prior written
consent of such Company Indemnitee.

  

  

(d) In the event Parent, Buyer, the Surviving LLC or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, Buyer, or the Surviving
LLC, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.4.

  

  

5.5 Payment of Deferred Compensation. Promptly following the Effective Time,
the Surviving LLC shall pay the Deferred Compensation amounts set forth on the
Allocation Certificate to the applicable third parties.

  

  

5.6 Employment and Benefits Arrangements.

  

  

(a) Continuing Employees shall receive standard employee benefits offered by
Parent to its employees of comparable status; provided that, until such time
as Continuing Employees participate in employee benefit plans provided by the
Buyer and its Affiliates from time to time, the Continuing Employees shall
continue to participate in the Company Benefit Plans.

  

  

(b) Buyer shall or shall cause the Surviving LLC to recognize as of the
Closing all accrued but unused vacation and sick pay of the Employees on
Schedule 5.6(b); provided, such time shall be utilized by such Employee prior
to the end of Parent's current fiscal year. For purposes of eligibility and
vesting under the employee benefit plans of the Buyer and their respective
Affiliates providing benefits to any Continuing Employees after the Closing
other than the Company Benefit Plans (the "New Plans"), and for purposes of
accrual of vacation and severance benefits under applicable New Plans, each
Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service
recognized by the Company before the Closing, to the same extent as such
Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by law.
In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before the replacement; and (ii)
for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Buyer shall take commercially
reasonable efforts to: (A) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, and (B) cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the plan year in which the
Closing occurs to be taken into account under any corresponding New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been incurred
under and in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Neither Parent nor Buyer is under any obligation to retain any Employee,
independent contractor or consultant, or provide any Employee, independent
contractor or consultant with any particular benefits.

  

  

(d) This Section 5.6 is not intended to amend any benefit plans or programs of
Parent or Buyer.

  

  

5.7 Retention Amount. Parent shall allocate to the Continuing Employees set
forth on Schedule 5.7, the amount set forth next to such Continuing Employees
name, which amount shall be payable at such times, in such amounts and upon
satisfaction of such conditions as are set forth on Schedule 5.7; provided,
however, that to the extent the aggregate amount of the allocations made to
such Continuing Employees on Schedule 5.7 as of the date hereof is less than
the amount of the Retention Pool, Parent and the Securityholder Representative
shall allocate the balance of the Retention Pool, to such Continuing
Employees, in such amounts and upon satisfaction of such conditions as Parent
and the Securityholder Representative mutually agree, each acting reasonably,
and Schedule 5.7 shall be amended in writing accordingly. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, to the extent any amount payable to a
Continuing Employee is not paid to such Continuing Employee as a result of the
failure of any condition set forth on Schedule 5.7, such unpaid amount shall
be forfeited and shall not thereafter be payable to any Person.

  

  

SECTION 6

  

  


 

  

  

TAX COVENANTS

  

  

6.1 Consistent Tax Reporting. Buyer, the Members, the Company, the Surviving
LLC and Parent agree and acknowledge that the Merger will (i) constitute a
transaction governed by IRS Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1991-1 C.B. 432 (situation
2), for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) result in the termination of
the Company pursuant to Section 708(b)(1)(A) of the Code for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (but not under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act)
and (iii) result in the taxable year of the Company ending on the Closing
Date. None of Buyer, the Members, the Company, the Surviving LLC or Parent
shall take a position or file a Tax Return that is inconsistent with such Tax
treatment, unless otherwise required pursuant to a final determination within
the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, or any analogous provision of
applicable state, local or foreign Law.

  

  

6.2 Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. The Securityholder
Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns of the Company for all taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Taxable Periods") that have not been
filed prior to the Closing Date. The Securityholder Representative shall
permit Parent to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
prior sentence at least ten (10) days prior to filing and shall make such
revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Parent to the
extent such revisions are consistent with applicable Law. Parent, Buyer, the
Surviving LLC and their respective Affiliates shall not amend any Tax Return
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, file any Tax Return for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period in a jurisdiction in which the Company did not previously file, or
extend the statute of limitations period in respect of any such Tax Return,
without the written consent of the Securityholder Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless
such amendment, filing, or extension is required pursuant to a final
determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, or any analogous
provision of applicable state, local or foreign Law. Parent, Buyer, the
Surviving LLC and their respective Affiliates shall not make, change or revoke
any Tax election that would result in an increase to the amounts owed by the
Members under this Agreement without the written consent of the Securityholder
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned

to a final determination within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code, or
any analogous provision of applicable state, local or foreign Law. The Company
shall not, and Parent, Buyer, the Surviving LLC and their respective
Affiliates shall not cause the Company or the Surviving LLC to, take any
action on or after the Closing outside the ordinary course of business that
would increase the liability of the Members for Taxes of the Company under
this Agreement, except as required by applicable Law. All Tax Returns to be
prepared by the Securityholder Representative pursuant to this Section 6.2
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practice of the
Company, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. The Members shall be
responsible for, and shall pay, all Taxes of the Company for all Pre-Closing
Taxable Periods, including Taxes resulting from any Contest. Such payments
shall be made no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for
paying such amount of Taxes to the relevant tax authority. The parties hereto
agree and acknowledge that all deductions (if any) relating to the payment of
Company Debt, Transaction Expenses, Change in Control Payments (and related
payroll Taxes), and payments to each holder of Company Phantom Units with
respect to such Company Phantom Units (and related payroll Taxes) shall be
reported on the federal income Tax Return of the Company for the period ending
on the Closing Date, unless otherwise required to be reported pursuant to
applicable Law.

  

  

6.3 Tax Periods Beginning or Ending After the Closing Date.

  

  

(a) The Surviving LLC shall cause to be prepared and filed any Tax Returns of
the Surviving LLC for any taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date
(each such period, a "Post-Closing Taxable Period"), and for all taxable
periods of the Company (or Surviving LLC, as applicable) that begin before,
but end after, the Closing Date (each such period, a "Straddle Period"). The
Surviving LLC shall permit Securityholder Representative to review and comment
on each Tax Return in respect of a Straddle Period at least ten (10) days
prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are
reasonably requested by Securityholder Representative to the extent such
revisions are consistent with applicable Law and would impact the liability of
the Members for Taxes of the Company under this Agreement. The Members shall
be responsible for all Taxes of a Straddle Period that relate to the portion
of such period ending on the Closing Date, including Taxes resulting from any
Contest, as determined under this Section 6.3, and shall pay to (or as
directed by) the Surviving LLC amounts equal to such Taxes. Such payments
shall be made in each applicable case by no later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the due date for paying such amount of Taxes to the relevant Tax
authority.

  

  

(b) For purposes of this Section 6.3, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion
of such Tax that relates to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall (a) in the case of any property Taxes and Taxes other than
Taxes based upon or related to income, payroll, sales or receipts, be deemed
to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period, and (b) in the case of any Tax based upon or
related to income, payroll, sales or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on the Closing Date. Any
credits relating a taxable period that begins before and ends after the
Closing Date shall be allocated on a basis consistent with the allocations
made pursuant to the preceding sentence.

  

  

6.4 Cooperation on Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Parent, Buyer, the Surviving LLC, the Members and the Securityholder
Representative shall cooperate fully, to the extent reasonably requested by
the others, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees,
agents, auditors and other representatives reasonably to cooperate, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to Sections 6.2 (Tax
Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date) and 6.3 (Tax Periods Beginning
or Ending After the Closing Date) or otherwise, and any audit, examination,
litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes (each, a

59  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

"Contest") and will provide prompt written notice thereof. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision
of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Return filing or Contest and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

  

  

(b) The Members and the Securityholder Representative agree that all books and
records in their possession with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company and the Surviving LLC are the property of the Company and, subsequent
to the Effective Time, the Surviving LLC. The Members shall deliver all such
books and records to the Company prior to Closing; provided, however, the
Securityholder Representative shall be permitted to retain copies of such
books and records. After the Closing the Surviving LLC shall make available to
the Securityholder Representative such books and records to the extent
reasonably necessary for the Securityholder Representative's filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to Section 6.2 (Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing
Date) or for any other reasonable purpose related to the Members' ownership of
the Company prior to the Closing, provided, however that in no event will any
Member be entitled to information under this Section in connection with any
litigation or dispute among the parties.

  

  

(c) If requested by Parent, the Company, the Members and the Securityholder
Representative will cooperate with Parent to obtain any certificate or other
document from any governmental authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed upon
the Company or the Surviving LLC (including, but not limited to, with respect
to the Transactions contemplated hereby).

  

  

(d) Parent, Buyer, the Company, the Surviving LLC, the Members and the
Securityholder Representative further agree, upon request, to provide the
other parties with all information that any party may be required to report
pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Department Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

  

  

6.5 Control of Audits. After the Closing Date, except as set forth in this
Section 6.5, the Surviving LLC shall control the conduct, through counsel of
its own choosing, of any Contest involving any asserted Tax liability or
refund with respect to the Surviving LLC or the Company; provided, however,
that the Surviving LLC shall provide prompt written notice to the
Securityholder Representative upon its first learning of any such asserted Tax
liability or refund and (provided, that any failure to give, or delay in
giving, such notice shall not relieve any Securityholder from its
indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent that it was
materially adversely prejudiced thereby) and shall not settle or otherwise
compromise any Contest involving any asserted Tax liability for which the
Members would be responsible or refund which the Members would be entitled to
receive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Securityholder Representative, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that
relates solely to Pre-Closing Tax Periods (or solely the portion of a Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date) if the Securityholder Representative,
following receipt of notice from the Surviving LLC as provided above, has
previously provided written notice to the Surviving LLC that Securityholders
are responsible for any amount assessed pursuant to the Contest, the
Securityholder Representative shall control the conduct of such Contest, but
the Surviving LLC shall have the right to participate in such Contest at its
own expense with counsel of its choosing, and neither the Members nor the
Securityholder Representative shall settle, compromise and/or concede any
portion of such Contest that could affect the Tax liability of the Surviving
LLC for any taxable period (or portion thereof) after the Closing Date without
the written consent of the Surviving LLC (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); provided that, if the Securityholder Representative
declines to assume control of the conduct of any such Contest or fails or is
failing to diligently respond to, control or defend against such Contest, in
each case, within 15 days following the receipt by the Securityholder
Representative of notice of such Contest, or the Surviving

LLC believes in good faith that either a Contest relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal matter or a material conflict of interest exists
between the Securityholders and the Surviving LLC that precludes effective
joint representation, the Surviving LLC shall have the right to assume control
of such Contest, but shall not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion
of such Contest that would impact the amount for which the Members are
responsible or would be entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement without
the written consent of the Securityholder Representative (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event of any conflict
between the provisions of this Section 6.5, the provisions of Section 11.4
(Notice and Opportunity to Defend) or the provisions of Section 11.5 (Third
Party Claims), the provisions of this Section 6.5 shall control.

  

  

6.6 Certain Taxes

  

  

All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property gains, stamp,
registration, and other such Taxes and fees incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be shared equally by Buyer and the Members. The Surviving LLC
will file all Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property gains, stamp, registration,
and other such Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law, Buyer and
the Members will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. The Members shall pay their share of such Taxes to the
Surviving LLC when due.

  

  

6.7 Refunds and Tax Benefits. Any refunds that are received by Parent, Buyer
or the Surviving LLC of Company Taxes that relate to taxable period other than
a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of Buyer. Any refunds that
are received by Parent, Buyer or the Surviving LLC of Company Taxes that
relate to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period or that portion of a Straddle Period
ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account of the Members
and Buyer shall pay over to Members any such refund (net of any Taxes of
Parent, Buyer or the Surviving LLC attributable to the receipt or accrual of
such refund or credit) within five days after receipt thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any such refunds of Taxes shall be for the account of Buyer to
the extent such refunds of Taxes are attributable to the carryback of items of
loss, deduction or credit, or other Tax items, of the Surviving LLC (or any of
its respective Affiliates, including Buyer) from a Post-Closing Taxable
Period.

relevant to the claim (to the extent not previously provided under this
Section 11.4(a)). A Claim Notice shall be given reasonably promptly following
the claimant's determination that facts or events are reasonably expected to
give rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder; provided that the failure
to give such written notice shall not relieve the party required to provide
such indemnification (the "Indemnifier") of its obligations hereunder, except
to the extent it shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure.

  

  

(b) An Indemnifier (acting through Parent, in the case of indemnification
sought by a Securityholder Indemnitee, and acting through the Securityholder
Representative, in the case of indemnification sought by a Buyer Indemnitee)
shall have thirty (30) days after the giving of any proper Claim Notice
pursuant hereto to (i) agree to the amount or method of determination set
forth in the Claim Notice and to pay or cause to be paid such amount to such
Indemnified Party in immediately available funds or (ii) provide the
Indemnified Party with written notice that it disagrees with the amount or
method of determination set forth in the Claim Notice (the "Dispute Notice").
For a period of thirty (30) days after the giving of any Dispute Notice, a
representative of the Indemnifier and the Indemnified Party shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve the matter. In the event that the controversy is not
resolved within thirty (30) days after the date the Dispute Notice is given,
the parties may thereupon proceed to pursue any and all available remedies at
Law. If the Indemnifier agrees to the Claim Notice pursuant to clause (i)
above or fails to provide a timely Dispute Notice pursuant to clause (ii)
above, then (x) if the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnitee, then the
Securityholders, subject to the terms and conditions of this SECTION 11, shall
pay the Buyer Indemnitee the amount set forth in the Claim Notice, or (y) if
the Indemnified Party is a Securityholder Indemnitee, then Parent shall pay,
or cause to be paid to, the Paying Agent or the Surviving LLC, for further
payment to the Securityholders the amount set forth in the Claim Notice.

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 11.4 shall not apply in the case of a Claim
Notice provided in connection with a Third-Party Claim made against an
Indemnified Party, which claims shall be governed by Section 11.5.

  

  

11.5 Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifier prompt written notice of
any legal proceeding, claim or demand instituted by any third party (a "Third-
Party Claim") in respect of which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification hereunder; provided that the failure to provide prompt notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifier of its indemnification obligations
hereunder, except to the extent (and only to the extent) that the Indemnifier
is actually and materially prejudiced by the failure of the Indemnified Party
to provide such prompt notice.

  

  

(b) The Indemnifier shall have the right, at the Indemnifier's expense, to
defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third-Party
Claim and to have the Indemnified Party represented by counsel, reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, selected by the Indemnifier; provided
that (i) the Indemnified Party may participate in any proceeding with counsel
of its choice and at its expense, (ii) Buyer or any of its Affiliates, at any
time when Buyer believes in good faith that any Third Party Claim is having or
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer or the
Business or relates to the IP Representations may assume the defense and
otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim in good faith, with counsel of its
choice, (iii) Parent or any of its Affiliates, at any time when Parent
believes in good faith that a claim for indemnification relates to or arises
in connection with any criminal matter, may assume the defense and otherwise
deal with such Third-Party Claim in good faith with counsel of its choice,
(iv) the Indemnifier may not assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim if a
material conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifier and the
Indemnified Party that precludes

effective joint representation or the amount of any Third-Party Claim exceeds
or reasonably could exceed the limitations set forth in Section 11.6(b), if
applicable, and (v) the Indemnified Party may take over the defense and
prosecution of a Third-Party Claim from the Indemnifier if the Indemnifier has
failed or is failing to diligently prosecute or defend such Third-Party Claim
following the provision of written notice to the Indemnifier of such failure
and the failure of the Indemnifier to cure such failure within fifteen (15)
days of receipt of such notice; and provided, further that the Indemnifier may
not enter into a settlement of any Third-Party Claim without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned, unless such settlement provides the Indemnified Party
with a full release from such Third-Party Claim and requires no more than a
monetary payment for which the Indemnified Party is fully indemnified. If the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party has previously provided written notice to the Indemnified
Party that the Indemnifying Party is responsible for the entire Third-Party
Claim, neither the Indemnified Party nor any of its Affiliates may settle or
otherwise dispose of any Third-Party Claim for which the Indemnifier may have
a liability under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifier, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense or is otherwise
negotiating any such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifier may participate in any
proceeding or negotiation with counsel of its choice and at its expense.

  

  

(c) Any notice that a Buyer Indemnitee shall be required to give to the
Securityholders under this Section 11.5 shall be satisfied by the delivery of
notice by Buyer Indemnitee to the Securityholder Representative, and the
Securityholder Representative may respond to Buyer Indemnitee on behalf of all
Securityholders; and any notice that a Securityholder Indemnitee shall be
required to give to Parent under this Section 11.5 shall be satisfied by the
delivery of notice by the Securityholder Representative to Parent .

  

  

11.6 Limitations on Indemnification; Other Remedies. The indemnification
provided by SECTION 11 (Indemnification) shall, except as provided in Section
11.6(h) (Fraud), be subject to the following limitations:

  

  

(a) Basket. No indemnification shall be payable pursuant to Section
11.2(a)(i), other than with respect to a Fundamental Representation, a Tax
Representation or an IP Representation for which none of this Section 11.6(a)
shall apply, unless the total amount of all indemnifiable Losses incurred by
Buyer Indemnitees, including those subject to all previous claims, exceeds
$750,000 (the "Basket"), whereupon indemnification shall be payable for the
whole amount of such Losses without deduction (and not merely the excess over
the Basket), provided, however, that no Losses may be claimed pursuant to
Section 11.2(a)(i) by any Buyer Indemnified Party or shall be reimbursable by
the Securityholders or shall be included in calculating the aggregate Losses
for purposes of this clause (a) except in the event Losses resulting from any
single claim or aggregated claims arising out of the same facts, events or
circumstances in excess of $25,000 (the "De Minimis Basket"). Where the Losses
agreed or determined in respect of any such claim or series of claims exceeds
the De Minimis Basket, the liability of the Indemnifiers shall be for the
whole amount without deduction (and not merely the excess over the De Minimis
Basket).

  

  

(b) Cap. Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 11.6, (i) each
Securityholder's aggregate liability for all claims for indemnification under
Section 11.2(a)(i) (in each case, other than with respect to a Fundamental
Representation, Tax Representation, or IP Representation) shall not exceed
his, her or its respective Pro Rata Share of the sum of the Escrow Amount,
plus such Securityholder's Earn-Out Share Percentage of the Earn-Out
Consideration to the extent earned, (ii) each Securityholder's aggregate
liability for all claims for indemnification under Section 11.2(a)(i), with
respect to any inaccuracy or breach of an IP Representation, shall not exceed
his, her or its respective Earn-Out Share Percentage of the IP Indemnity Cap,
and (iii) each Securityholder's aggregate liability for

  

   
 

 

 

 

     |  

  |   
---|---|--- 
 

  

DB3/200169974.12

 

  

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

   
 


 

  

all claims for indemnification under any other subsection of Section 11.2(a),
may not exceed the Merger Consideration actually received by such
Securityholder, net of applicable Taxes but including (x) deemed receipt of
the applicable amount of the Escrow Amount and the Expense Fund, plus (y) such
Securityholder's Earn-Out Share Percentage of the Earn-Out Consideration to
the extent earned.

  

  

(c) Escrow Amount. Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 11.6,
all claims for indemnification under Section 11.2 (Obligations of the
Securityholders to Indemnify) shall be satisfied first from the Escrow Amount
to the full extent thereof. For clarity, indemnifiable Losses under Section
11.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to a Fundamental Representation, Tax
Representation or IP Representation) shall be satisfied solely out of the
Escrow Account and recovery against the Escrow Amount constitutes the sole and
exclusive remedy of Buyer Indemnitees for all such Losses.

  

  

(d) Set-off. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 11.6, if at
any time there shall be an outstanding Claim that exceeds the Escrow Amount
then available, Buyer shall have the right to withhold from, reduce, set-off
against and retain from any required payments of Earn-Out Consideration to any
Securityholder, the good faith estimate of any indemnification to which a
Buyer Indemnitee is entitled hereunder; provided that if the final amount of
Losses for such Claim is less than the amount by which the portion of the
Earn-Out Consideration was withheld, reduced, set-off or retained, then Buyer
shall make payment of such difference in accordance with Section 1.8 (Earn-
Out) to the Securityholders in accordance with their Earn-Out Share
Percentage; provided further, however, that Buyer shall not set off any Losses
(but may withhold any such payment) for which it may be entitled until such
Claim has been finally resolved in accordance with this SECTION 11.

  

  

(e) Reduction for Insurance. The amount of any Losses that are subject to
indemnification under this SECTION 11 shall be reduced by the amount by which
(a) any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party relating
to such Loss exceeds (b) the amount of expenses incurred by such Indemnified
Party in procuring such insurance recovery, including reasonable legal fees
and expenses and any increased premiums or costs as a result of such claim for
which insurance proceeds are received. Except to the extent required pursuant
to Section 11.6(f), this Section 11.6(e) shall not imply and shall not be
construed to imply any obligation on the part of any Person to seek or pursue
any such recovery and the failure to seek or pursue any such recovery shall
not be a defense to any indemnification obligation hereunder.

  

  

(f) Mitigation. Each party shall take commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate the Losses that any such party reasonably expects will result from
such event or circumstances and for which it may seek indemnification (it
being understood that nothing herein shall limit the right to seek
indemnification hereunder with respect to any costs of such mitigation) upon
becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does,
give rise thereto, provided that the Indemnifier shall not be required to
materially alter its conduct in connection therewith. Nothing in this
Agreement shall relieve either party of any common law or other duty to
mitigate any loss, liability or damage suffered by it.

  

  

(g) Sole Remedy; No Duplication of Recovery. Subject to Section 11.6(h)
(Fraud), the sole and exclusive remedy for money damages for any matter
arising under this Agreement shall be the rights to indemnification set forth
in this Agreement and the rights set forth in SECTION 12. Losses shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Losses constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation. To the extent
that a portion of any indemnifiable Loss is specifically included as a
liability in the calculation of Net Working Capital, then the amount
specifically included as a liability will be subtracted from the total
indemnifiable Losses payable in respect of such indemnifiable Loss. For the

avoidance of doubt, Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
for any Loss to the extent such Loss consists of liabilities that were
included in the determination of Net Working Capital.

  

  

(h) Fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
survival periods, limitations, caps, thresholds and other provisions set forth
in this SECTION 11 (Indemnification) shall not apply with respect to (i)
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach or willful misconduct,
or (ii) any equitable remedy, including a preliminary or permanent injunction
or specific performance; provided, that no claim of fraud may be brought
pursuant to this Agreement subsequent to five (5) years after the Closing Date
and any other claim with respect to the matters in clauses (i) or (ii) above
brought subsequent to the five (5) years after the Closing shall be subject to
the survival periods, limitations, thresholds and other provisions set forth
in this SECTION 11 (Indemnification); provided, further that (A) the liability
of a Securityholder in respect of all such claims brought pursuant to this
Agreement may not exceed the Merger Consideration actually received by the
Securityholder, net of applicable Taxes actually paid but including (x) deemed
receipt of the applicable amount of the Escrow Amount and Expense Fund, if
applicable, plus (y) such Securityholder's Earn-Out Share Percentage of the
Earn-Out Consideration to the extent earned, except in the case of the fraud,
intentional misrepresentation, willful breach or willful misconduct of such
Securityholder, and (B) a Securityholder not subject to the restrictions
contained in a Non-Competition Agreement shall not be liable to indemnify any
Buyer Indemnified Party for Losses arising from a breach by a Securityholder
of his or her Non-Competition Agreement.

  

  

(i) Merger Consideration Adjustment. The Company, Parent, Buyer, the Surviving
LLC, the Securityholder Representative and the Securityholders agree to treat
each indemnification payment pursuant to this SECTION 11 as an adjustment to
the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes and shall take no position
contrary thereto unless required to do so pursuant to a final determination as
defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code, or any analogous provision of
applicable state, local or foreign Law.

  

  

(j) Limitation of Liabilities. UNLESS SUCH DAMAGES ARE ACTUALLY PAID TO A
THIRD PARTY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS SECTION 11 IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD-
PARTY CLAIM, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY OR OTHER PERSON
FOR (i) ANY SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS AND
OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, COLLATERAL DAMAGES OF ANY
KIND OR (ii) PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, IN EACH CASE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
SUCH PARTY WILL BE ADVISED, WILL HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT WILL
KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE FOREGOING

  

  

(k) No Subrogation. Following the Closing, no Securityholder shall have any
right of indemnification, contribution or subrogation against the Company with
respect to any indemnification payment made by or on behalf of any
Securityholder under Section 11.2 if the Merger and the Transactions are
consummated.

  

  

SECTION 12

(b) by Buyer, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its obligations, covenants or agreements under this
Agreement, or if any of the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct such that the condition

(c) by the Company, if Parent or Buyer shall have breached or failed to
perform in any material respect any of its respective obligations, covenants

other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Transactions,

the Transactions illegal;

  

  

(h) by Buyer if there shall have been any action taken, or any Law enacted,

Confidentiality Agreement, this Section 12.2, Section 4.6(a) (Confidentiality;
Non-Disparagement), Section 4.8 (Public Disclosure), and SECTION 13

(b) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, prior to the Closing, this

(b) The parties (i) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the

assert, by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any such suit, action
or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is
improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be
enforced in or by such court.

  

  

(c) The Company, the Securityholders and the Securityholder Representative
hereby agree that, if any claim, suit, action or other proceeding of any
nature is commenced against any Indemnified Party by any Person in or before
any court or other tribunal anywhere in the world, then such Indemnified Party
may proceed against the Securityholders and the Securityholder Representative
in or before such court or other tribunal with respect to any indemnification
claim or other claim arising directly or indirectly from or relating directly
or indirectly to such claim, suit, action or other proceeding or any of the
matters alleged therein or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto.

  

  

(d) EACH PARTY (AND EACH SECURITYHOLDER) ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY

RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE ESCROW AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER ANCILLARY
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS OR THE FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO EACH
PARTY'S EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OR ANY ACTIONS OF ANY OF THE AFFILIATES OR
REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY OTHER PARTY RELATED THERETO.

  

  

(e) EACH OF THE SECURITYHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE, THE COMPANY, PARENT AND BUYER
(1) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTIES
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVERS, (2) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (3) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND (4) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES
HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13.3.

  

  

13.4 No Prejudice. The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations
of the Company, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the
Indemnified Parties based on such representations, warranties, covenants and
obligations, will not be limited or affected by any investigation conducted by
Parent or Buyer or any agent of Parent or Buyer with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by Parent or Buyer or any
agent of Parent or Buyer at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy

or inaccuracy of or compliance with or performance of any such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation, and no Indemnified Party shall be required
to show that it relied on any (and each Indemnified Party shall be deemed to
have relied on each) such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of
the Company in order to be entitled to indemnification pursuant to SECTION 11
(Indemnification). The waiver by Parent or Buyer of any of the conditions set
forth in SECTION 8 (Conditions To Each Party's Obligation To Close) or SECTION
9 (Conditions To The Obligations Of Buyer To Close) will not affect or limit
the provisions of SECTION 11 (Indemnification).

  

  

13.5 Specific Performance and Other Remedies. Each party hereby acknowledges
that the rights of each party to consummate the Transactions and the covenants
of the parties are special, unique and of extraordinary character and that, in
the event that any party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant
or agreement made by it herein, the non-breaching party may be without an
adequate remedy at Law. In the event that any party violates or fails or
refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by such party herein, the
non-breaching party shall be entitled, in addition to the exercise of other
remedies, to seek and (subject to court approval) obtain injunctive and other
equitable relief, without necessity of posting a bond, restraining such party
from committing such breach or threatened breach. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise
by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy.

  

  

13.6 No Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy.

  

  

13.7 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and legal
representatives.

  

  

13.8 Construction. Whenever the context requires:

masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine

shall include the masculine and feminine genders.

  

  

(b) Any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved
against the drafting party shall not be applied in the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement. The words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

  

  

(c) Whenever this Agreement requires the disclosure of an agreement or
Contract on the Company Disclosure Schedule or the delivery to Buyer of an
agreement or Contract, that disclosure requirement or delivery requirement, as
applicable, require disclosure or delivery of the entire, unredacted document
and shall also require the disclosure or delivery of each and every amendment,
extension, exhibit, attachment, schedule, addendum, appendix, statement of
work, change order, and any other similar instrument or document relating to
that agreement or Contract.

(e) All references to accounting terms shall be interpreted in accordance with
GAAP unless otherwise specified.

  

  

(f) Any reference to any party to this Agreement shall include such party's
successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

(g) The specificity of any representation or warranty contained herein shall
not be deemed to limit the generality of any other representation or warranty
contained herein.

  

  

13.9 Counterparts; Delivery. This Agreement may be executed by the parties
hereto in two (2) or more separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall
together constitute one and the same instrument. Any signature page delivered
by facsimile or electronic image transmission (including in the form of a PDF
file) shall be binding to the same extent as an original signature page. Any
party that delivers a signature page by facsimile or electronic image
transmission shall deliver an original counterpart to any other party that
requests such original counterpart.

  

  

13.10 Exhibits and Schedules. The exhibits and schedules (including the
Company Disclosure Schedule) are a part of this Agreement as fully set forth
herein. All references herein to Sections, subsections, clauses, exhibits and
schedules shall be deemed references to such parts of this Agreement, unless
the context shall otherwise require.

  

  

13.11 Headings. The table of contents and the headings in this Agreement are
for reference only, and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

13.12 Expenses. Except as set forth herein, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions, including all legal, accounting, tax and
financial advisory, consulting, investment banking and all other fees and
expenses of third parties shall be the obligation of the party incurring such
fees and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any action, claim or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements or the
enforcement of any provision thereof is brought against any party, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees,
costs and disbursements, in addition to any other relief to which the
prevailing party may be entitled.

  

  

13.13 Severability. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to require the
commission of any act contrary to Law. Should there be any conflict between
any provisions hereof and any present or future statute, Law, ordinance,
regulation, or other pronouncement having the force of Law, the latter shall
prevail, but the provision of this Agreement affected thereby shall be
curtailed and limited to the extent necessary to bring it into compliance
therewith, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect.

  

  

13.14 No Strict Construction. The parties hereto have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the other agreements and
documents contemplated herein. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises under any provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement or documents contemplated herein, this Agreement and such other
agreements or documents shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties thereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authoring any of the provisions of this
Agreement or any other agreements or documents contemplated herein.

(a) Immediately upon execution of the Member Consent by the requisite holders
to constitute Member Approval, and without the requirement of further action
on the part of any Securityholder, each Securityholder shall be deemed to, and
shall, have consented to the appointment of Cedar Holder Representative, LLC
as the Securityholder Representative, as the agent and attorney-in-fact for
and on behalf of such Securityholder (the "Securityholder Representative").
The Securityholder Representative shall, on behalf of the Securityholders:

  

  

(i) take all action permitted in connection with the implementation of those
provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement that require or permit
action by the Securityholder Representative;

  

  

(ii) take all action permitted in connection with the defense and/or
settlement of any and all claims for which the Securityholders may be required
to provide indemnification pursuant to SECTION 11 (Indemnification) hereof
(including rejecting, contesting, negotiating, settling and resolving any such
claims) and any claims that may be made against the Escrow Amount;

  

  

(iii) comply with Orders of courts and determinations and awards of
arbitrators with respect to claims;

  

  

(iv) review and take action with respect to Tax Returns;

  

  

(v) give and receive all notices and service of process required or permitted
to be given or received by the Securityholders or the Securityholder
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

  

  

(vi) execute and deliver all amendments and waivers to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement that the Securityholder Representative deemed necessary or
appropriate, whether prior to, at or after the Closing;

  

  

(vii) take any action delegated to the Securityholder Representative set forth
in Schedule 1.8; and

  

  

(viii) take any and all such additional action as is contemplated to be taken
by or on behalf of the Securityholders by the terms of this Agreement or of
the Escrow Agreement or as may be necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
the Securityholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

  

  

(b) All notices provided to and/or legal process served upon the
Securityholder Representative in accordance with this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement shall be deemed to be provided to and/or served upon the
Securityholders and shall be conclusive and binding upon the Securityholders.
All decisions, actions, agreements, and instructions by the Securityholder
Representative, including any consent, waiver, or agreement between the
Securityholder Representative and any Buyer Indemnitee relating to the defense
or settlement of any claim for which the Securityholders may be required to
provide indemnification pursuant to SECTION 11 (Indemnification) hereof, shall
be conclusive and binding upon the Securityholders; and Parent, Buyer, each
other Buyer Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
conclusively thereon. Parent, Buyer, each other Buyer Indemnitee and the
Escrow Agent shall have no duty to inquire into the authority of any person
reasonably believed to be the Securityholder Representative and no
responsibility or liability for any action or omission thereof, and no party
shall have any cause of action against Parent, Buyer, any other Buyer
Indemnitee or

DB3/200169974.12

the Escrow Agent for any action or omission by such party in reliance upon the
instructions or decisions of any person reasonably believed to be the
Securityholder Representative.

  

  

(c) In the event that more than one Person shall at any time serve
collectively as the Securityholder Representative, decisions of such Persons
shall, as between them and with respect to the rights of the Securityholders
in relation to the Securityholder Representative, be made by majority vote;
provided, however that they shall designate a single Person as "Securityholder
Representative" for all purposes involving Parent, Buyer, any other Buyer
Indemnitee, or the Escrow Agent.

  

  

(d) The Securityholder Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the
Securityholders notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the
Securityholders. In taking any actions as Securityholder Representative, the
Securityholder Representative may rely conclusively, without any further
inquiry or investigation, upon any certification or confirmation, oral or
written, given by any Person he, she or it reasonably believes to be
authorized thereunto. The Securityholder Representative may, in all questions
arising hereunder, rely on the advice of counsel, and the Securityholder
Representative shall not be liable to any Securityholder for anything done,
omitted or suffered in good faith by the Securityholder Representative based
on such advice. The Securityholder Representative undertakes to perform such
duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement
and/or the Escrow Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be
read into this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement against the Securityholder
Representative.

  

  

(e) As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to wire to
the Securityholder Representative the Expense Fund, which will be held by the
Securityholder Representative as agent and for the benefit of the
Securityholders and will be used for the purposes of paying any professional
fees and expenses of any attorney, accountant or other advisors retained by
the Securityholder Representative and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Securityholder Representative in connection with the
performance of the Securityholder Representative's duties under this Agreement
("Representative Expenses"). The Securityholders acknowledge that the
Securityholder Representative is not providing any investment supervision,
recommendations or advice. The Securityholder Representative shall not have
any liability to any Securityholder for any action taken, suffered or omitted
by him or it as Securityholder Representative without gross negligence. The
Escrow Participants shall, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Shares, indemnify, defend and hold the Securityholder Representative harmless
from and against any loss, damage, Tax, Liability and expense that may be
incurred or paid by the Securityholder Representative arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of his, her or its duties
(except as caused by the Securityholder Representative's gross negligence),
including the legal costs and expenses of defending the Securityholder
Representative against any claim or Liability in connection with the
performance of his, her or its duties, to the extent such losses, damages,
Taxes, Liabilities and expenses exceed the Expense Fund. The Escrow
Participants will not receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund.
The Securityholder Representative shall be entitled to recover from the
Securityholders any Representative Expenses reasonably incurred by the
Securityholder Representative in connection with actions taken by the
Securityholder Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, without the requirement of any consent or approval by Buyer
or any other Person. All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to
the Securityholder Representative under this Agreement shall survive the
Merger or any termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(f) If not paid directly to the Securityholder Representative by the
Securityholders, the Representative Expenses shall be satisfied (i) from the
Expense Fund, (ii) to the extent the amount of the Representative Expenses
exceeds the amounts then available in the Expense Fund, from any amounts
payable to the Escrow Participants from the Escrow Amount solely to the extent
the Escrow Participants would otherwise then be paid such amounts from the
Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of this

Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (as applicable) and (iii) to the extent the
amount of the Representative Expenses exceeds amounts immediately available to
the Securityholder Representative under (i) and (ii), from each
Securityholder, severally and not jointly and in proportion to his, her or its
Earn-Out Share Percentage; provided that while this section allows the
Securityholder Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund and the Escrow
Amount, this does not relieve the Securityholders from their obligation to
promptly pay such Representative Expenses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Securityholder Representative from seeking any
remedies available to it at Law or otherwise.

  

  

(g) The Securityholder Representative shall have the power to designate his,
her or its successor hereunder. In the event that the Securityholder
Representative resigns from such position or is unable to continue in such
position without having designated a successor, the Escrow Participants
holding among them the rights to receive at least a majority of the amount
then remaining in the Escrow Amount to be distributed to the Escrow
Participants (or, if no Escrow Amount remains, representing a majority in
interest of the Pro Rata Shares) (the "Majority Holders") shall promptly
appoint another representative to fill such vacancy, and such substituted
representative shall be deemed to be the Securityholder Representative for all
purposes of this Agreement; provided that a resigning Securityholder
Representative shall continue to perform his, her or its duties and
obligations until his, her or its successor is appointed and has become a
party to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. In the absence of such
appointment, the Securityholder Representative or Buyer may apply to a court
of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Securityholder
Representative, and the costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees
incurred in connection with such proceeding shall be paid from the Expense
Fund or, to the extent exhausted, the Securityholders. The Securityholder
Representative may be removed at any time upon the written consent of the
Majority Holders with not less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice to
Buyer; provided, however, that a successor Securityholder Representative must
be concurrently appointed and become a party to this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

(h) The provisions of this Section 13.15 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Securityholder may have in
connection with the Transactions. Remedies available at Law for any breach of
the provisions of this Section 13.15 will be inadequate; therefore, Buyer and
each other Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to temporary and permanent
injunctive relief without the necessity of proving damages or posting any bond
if such person brings an action or proceeding to enforce the provisions of
this Section 13.15.

  

  

13.16 Representations and Warranties of the Securityholder Representative. The
Securityholder Representative is a limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its formation or organization. The Securityholder Representative has all
requisite limited liability company power and authority to enter into, execute
and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a
party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and to consummate
the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, the performance by the
Securityholder Representative of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and
the consummation of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all
necessary limited liability company and member action. This Agreement has
been, and the Ancillary Agreements to which the Securityholder Representative
is a party, when delivered at the Closing will be, duly executed and delivered
by the Securityholder Representative and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which
the Securityholder Representative is a party, by Parent or Buyer, as
applicable, this Agreement constitutes, and the Ancillary Agreements to which
the Securityholder Representative is a party when executed and delivered, will
constitute, the valid and binding obligation of the Securityholder
Representative, enforceable against it in accordance with their respective
terms, except as such

enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general equitable principles.

  

  

13.17 Compliance with Obligations.

  

  

Parent agrees to take all action necessary to cause Buyer and the Surviving
LLC, as applicable, to comply in all respects with each of the covenants,
obligations, agreements and undertakings made or required to be performed by
Buyer and the Surviving LLC, as applicable, under this Agreement, the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. As a material inducement
to the Company's willingness to enter into this Agreement and perform its
obligations hereunder, Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and faithful
performance and discharge by Buyer and the Surviving LLC, as applicable, of
each of the covenants, terms, obligations and undertakings made or required to
be performed by Buyer and the Surviving LLC, as applicable, under this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including any such obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings
that are required to be performed, discharged or complied with following the
Effective Time. The Company or Securityholder Representative, as applicable,
shall have the right to pursue any and all remedies available under this
Agreement arising out of any such breach or nonperformance directly against
any or all of Parent, Buyer and the Surviving LLC in the first instance.
Parent hereby waives any right to require any proceeding first against Buyer
or the Surviving LLC, as applicable, in connection with the performance of its
obligations set forth in this Section 13.17. Nothing herein shall be construed
as requiring Parent to take any action or causing Buyer to take any action or
omit from taking any action, which Buyer would not be required to take under
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

13.18 No Conflict.

  

  

(a) If the Securityholder Representative so desires, acting on behalf of the
Securityholders and without the need for additional consent or waiver by
Parent, Buyer or the Surviving LLC, Pepper Hamilton LLP shall be permitted to
represent the Securityholder Representative after the Closing with respect to
any matters related to this Agreement or any disagreement or dispute relating
thereto. All communications in any form or format whatsoever between or among
Pepper Hamilton LLP, on the one hand, and the Company, the Securityholder
Representative and/or any Securityholder, or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or other representatives, on the other hand, if
and only if such communications primarily relate to (i) the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the Transactions or (ii) any dispute arising
under this Agreement, in the case of either (i) or (ii), to the extent that
they occur prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the "Privileged
Communications") shall be deemed to be attorney-client privileged and the
expectation of client confidence relating thereto belong solely to the
Securityholder Representative and the Securityholders, shall be controlled by
the Securityholder Representative on behalf of the Securityholders and shall
not pass to or be claimed by Parent, Buyer, or the Surviving LLC.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Parent, Buyer or the Surviving LLC, on the one hand, and a third party other
than the Securityholder Representative or a Securityholder, on the other hand,
Parent, Buyer or the Surviving LLC may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Communications to such third party;
provided, however, that none of Parent, Buyer or the Surviving LLC may waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of the Securityholder
Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. In the event that Parent, Buyer or the Surviving LLC is legally
required by governmental order or otherwise legally required to access or
obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged Communications, to the
extent (x) permitted by Law, and (y) advisable in the opinion of Parent's
counsel, then Parent shall immediately (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days) notify the Securityholder Representative in writing (including
by making specific reference to this Section) so that the Securityholder
Representative can seek a protective order.

(b) If and to the extent that files or other materials maintained by Pepper
Hamilton LLP consist of Privileged Communications and constitute property of
its clients, only the Securityholder Representative and the Members shall hold
such property rights and Pepper Hamilton LLP shall have no duty to reveal or
disclose any Privileged Communications by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Pepper Hamilton LLP, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 13.18(b) does not
apply to any portion of such files or other materials that do not consist of
Privileged Communications.
