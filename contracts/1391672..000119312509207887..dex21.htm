of incorporation of the Surviving 



 

5  Corporation), and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, Sub shall merge
with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease
and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. The Company, as
the surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred
to as the "Surviving Corporation."

1.3 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the
"Closing") shall take place at a time and date to be specified by the parties
which will be no later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or
waiver of each of the conditions set forth in Article VI (excluding conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) or at such other time as the
parties hereto agree in writing. The Closing shall take place at the offices
of Fenwick and West LLP, Silicon Valley Center, 801 California Street, Mountain
View, California, or at such other location as the parties hereto agree in
writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is herein referred to as the

writing of each of the conditions set forth in Article VI, Sub and the Company
shall cause the Certificate of Merger to be filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
Delaware Law (the time of acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware of such filing or such later time as may be agreed to by Parent and
the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger being referred to
herein as the "Effective Time").

1.5 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger, and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
shall become debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.6 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended to read as set forth in Attachment A to the
Certificate of Merger until thereafter amended as provided by Delaware Law and
such Certificate of Incorporation.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided by Delaware Law, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, and such Bylaws.

1.7 _Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time, the directors and
officers of Sub, as constituted immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

1.8 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and without any action on the part of any holder of Company Capital Stock:

(i) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares and shares cancelled pursuant to Section 1.8(b)) shall be converted
into the right to receive, subject to and in accordance with Section 1.10(c),
an amount of cash equal to the Per-Share Cash Amount, without interest. As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall
automatically be cancelled and no longer be deemed outstanding, and the
holders thereof shall not have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Per-Share Cash Amount, without interest, upon surrender
of Certificates (as defined in Section 1.10) in accordance with Section 1.10.



 

6 (ii) At the Effective Time, each share of capital stock of Sub that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without further action on the part of the sole stockholder of
Sub, be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation (and the shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into
which the shares of Sub capital stock are so converted shall be the only
shares of the Surviving Corporations capital stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately after the Effective Time). The certificate evidencing
ownership of shares of Sub common stock will evidence ownership of the same
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Company Capital Stock Owned by the Company and Parent_.
At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned by
the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
each share of Company Capital Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or subsidiary of Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof.

(c) _Adjustments_. In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into capital stock), reorganization, reclassification,
combination, recapitalization or other like change with respect to the
Company Capital Stock or Parent Common Stock occurring after the Agreement
Date and prior to the Effective Time, all references in this Agreement to
specified numbers of shares of any class or series affected thereby, and all
calculations provided for that are based upon numbers of shares of any class
or series (or trading prices therefor) affected thereby, shall be equitably
adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change.

(d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, if any stockholder of the Company that is entitled to appraisal
rights demands to be paid the "fair value" of such holders shares of Company
Capital Stock and complies with all conditions and obligations necessary to
perfect appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware Law, each Dissenting
Share held by such stockholder will not be converted into the right to the
cash amounts set forth in Section 1.8(a), but shall be entitled only to such
rights as are granted by Delaware Law to a holder of Dissenting Shares except
as provided in this Section 1.8(d). The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any such demands received by the Company, including any stockholder
s notice of their intent to demand payment pursuant to Delaware Law that the
Company receives prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and
received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands under Delaware Law.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting
Shares. If, after the Effective Time, any Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to seek
appraisal rights, the Dissenting Shares held by such stockholder shall
immediately be converted into the right to receive the cash payable pursuant
to Section 1.8(a) in respect of such shares as if such shares never had been
Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof,
at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable after) the applicable time or
times specified in Section 1.10(c), following the satisfaction of the
applicable conditions set forth in Section 1.10(c), the amount of cash
to which such holder would be entitled in respect thereof under Section
1.8(a) as if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares (and all such cash
shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have become deliverable
to such holder pursuant to Section 1.8(a)).

1.9 _Unvested Company Shares; Company Options; Company RSUs_.

(a) _Unvested Company Shares_. The payout of cash pursuant to clause (i) of
Section 1.8(a) in exchange for Company Common Stock that immediately prior to
the Effective Time was restricted, not fully vested or subject to Repurchase
Rights ("Unvested Company Shares") shall be subject to the same restrictions,
vesting arrangements or Repurchase Rights that were applicable to such
Unvested Company Shares 



 

7  immediately prior to or at the Effective Time. Therefore, cash otherwise
payable pursuant to Section 1.8(a)(i) in exchange for each share of Company
Common Stock that immediately prior to the Effective Time was restricted or
not fully vested ("Unvested Cash") shall not be payable by Parent at the
Effective Time, and shall instead be paid out by Parent on the date that such
share of Company Common Stock would have become vested under the vesting
schedule in place for such share immediately prior to or at the Effective Time
(subject to the conditions and other terms of such vesting schedule, any
applicable employment, change in control or retention plan or agreement (as
modified or superseded by any Equity Agreement and/or Benefits Waiver), and
provided that if such conditions and terms are not satisfied and vesting
ceases to continue at any point after the Effective Time, no cash payments
shall be made, except the repurchase price described below, with respect to
the unvested shares of Company Common Stock). Parent shall make, or in its
discretion shall cause a paying agent authorized by Parent to administer such
payments on Parents behalf to make, all such required payments to holders of
Unvested Cash no later than the 15th day of the calendar month immediately
following the calendar month in which such Unvested Cash would have become
vested under the original vesting schedule. All amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 1.9(a) shall be subject to any required withholding of Taxes and
shall be paid without interest. A portion of such newly vested cash so
distributed will be treated as imputed interest to the extent required under
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. All outstanding
Repurchase Rights with respect to Unvested Company Shares that the Company may
hold immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assigned to Parent in
the Merger and shall thereafter be exercisable by Parent upon the same terms
and subject to the same conditions that were in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (including those under any applicable employment, change in
control or retention plan or agreement (as modified or superseded by any
Equity Agreement and/or Benefits Waiver)), except that Repurchase Rights may
be exercised by Parent retaining the Unvested Cash into which such Unvested
Company Shares have been converted and paying to the former holder
thereof the repurchase price in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time for each such share subject to that Repurchase Right. Following the
Effective Time, no Unvested Cash, or right thereto, may be pledged,
encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by
operation of law), by any Person, other than Parent, or be taken or reached by
any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any debt or other liability
of such Person, prior to the distribution to such Person of such Unvested
Cash in accordance with this Agreement.

(b) _Company Options and Company RSUs held by Continuing Employees or as 2000
Plan Awards_. At the Effective Time, each Company Option held by a Continuing
Employee and any other Company Options that are 2000 Plan Awards that are
unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a "Rollover Option"), and each Company RSU held by a
Continuing Employee and any other Company RSUs that are 2000 Plan Awards that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Rollover RSU"), shall on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement (including Section 1.9(d)) be assumed and converted by
Parent in accordance with Section 5.11.

(c) _2007 Plan Awards Held by Persons Other than Continuing Employees_. Parent
will not assume any 2007 Plan Awards held by Persons who are not Continuing
Employees. At the Effective Time, each vested 2007 Plan Award held by a Person
that is not a Continuing Employee shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
the need for any further action on the part of the holder thereof, subject to
and in accordance with Section 1.10, be converted into and represent the right
to receive the Cash Out Amount from Parent for such Company Option or Company
RSU; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Cash Out Amount the amount of
withholding for Taxes required to be deducted and withheld as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Cash Out Amount payable to each Person
covered by this Section 1.9(c) hereunder shall be rounded to the nearest cent
and computed after aggregating cash amounts for all Company Options or Company
RSUs represented by a particular grant held by such non-Continuing Employee.
Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the payment to each
Person that is not a Continuing Employee but holds a 2007 Plan Award of an
amount equal to the Cash Out Amount with respect to each such Company Option
and Company RSU. At the Effective Time, each 2007 Plan Award that is held by
a Person covered by this Section 1.9(c) will, by virtue of the Merger and
without any further action on the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled and
extinguished. 



 

8 (d) _Reserved but Unissued Shares_. At the Effective Time, the Specified
Target Plan (as defined in Section 5.11(e)) and all shares of Company Common
Stock then reserved and available for issuance under the Specified Target Plan
shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.11(e). 

1.10 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Parents transfer agent, Computershare Investor
Services, shall act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

(b) _Parent to Deposit Cash_. At or promptly following the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or shall cause a direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent to,
deposit with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I
the cash payable pursuant to Sections 1.8(a) and 1.9(c).

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates ("Certificates") and each holder of record of uncertificated
shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry shares
("Uncertificated Shares") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock, (i) a letter of
transmittal (that shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use of such
letter of transmittal in effecting surrender of Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the cash payable pursuant to Section
1.8(a). Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, or upon receipt by the Exchange
Agent of an appropriate agents message in the case of book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, each holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check for the cash
amount that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.8(a) in
respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, and the Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so
surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence
only the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 1.8(a), except as provided
in Section 1.8(d).

(d) _No Interest_. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash payable
pursuant to Section 1.8(a) or Section 1.9(a).

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amount payable pursuant to Section
1.8(a) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person to which the
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange shall
have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of cash in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate or Uncertificated Shares surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.10, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party
hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Legal Requirement.

(g) _Unclaimed Cash_. Any portion of funds held by the Exchange Agent which
have not been delivered to any holders of Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares pursuant to this Article I within six months after the Effective Time
shall promptly be paid to Parent, and thereafter each holder of a Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares who has not theretofore complied with the exchange
procedures set forth in and contemplated by Section 1.10(c) shall look only to
Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) for its
claim, only as a general unsecured creditor thereof, to the cash payable to
such holder pursuant to 



 

9  Section 1.8(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
if any Certificate or Uncertificated Shares have not been surrendered prior to
the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which the merger consideration contemplated by Section 1.8(a)
in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any amounts
payable in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

1.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. All cash paid or
payable following the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be so paid or
payable in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Capital Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article I.

1.12 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such Certificate, following the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the record holder thereof, such cash as may be required pursuant to
Section 1.8(a) in respect of such Certificate; provided, however, that Parent
or the Exchange Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the record holder of such Certificate to deliver
a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent and/or any of their
respective representatives or agents with respect to such Certificate.

1.13 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the cash otherwise deliverable under this Agreement,
from shares deliverable upon exercise of Rollover Options and settlement of
Rollover RSUs assumed by Parent pursuant to this Agreement, and from any other
payments otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, to any holder of
any shares of Company Capital Stock, any Company Options, any Company RSUs or
any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares such amounts as the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to any such deliveries and payments under the Code, any
provision of state, local, provincial or foreign Legal Requirements. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to such
holders in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

1.14 _Tax Consequences_. Parent makes no representations or warranties to the
Company or to any holder of Company Capital Stock, Company Options or Company
RSUs regarding the Tax treatment of the Merger, or any Tax consequences to the
Company or any such holder of this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other
transactions or agreements contemplated hereby.

1.15 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and interest in, to and under, and/or possession of, all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in
the name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, to take all lawful action
necessary or desirable to accomplish such purpose or acts, except to the
extent inconsistent with this Agreement.



 

10 ARTICLE II __

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as disclosed in the disclosure letter of the Company delivered to
Parent and Sub concurrently with the parties execution of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Letter") (each of which exceptions, in order to be
effective, shall clearly indicate the Section and, if applicable, the
Subsection of this Article II to which it relates (unless and to the extent
the relevance of such disclosure to other representations and warranties is
reasonably apparent from the actual text of the disclosed exception, in which
event such disclosed exception shall be deemed so applicable to such other
representations and warranties)), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Sub as follows:

2.1 _Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries_.

(a) Each of the Company and each Subsidiary is a corporation or other legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its jurisdiction of organization (except in the case of good standing, any
jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept) and has the requisite
corporate or other power to own its properties and to conduct its business as
now being conducted and as currently proposed by it to be conducted (without
regard to the Merger) and is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the failure to be so qualified and in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate with any such other failures,
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(b) The Company has made available to Parent a correct and complete copy of
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents, as applicable, of the Company and each Subsidiary, in each case as
amended to date. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation of any
of the provisions of its Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents. _Schedule 2.1_ to the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a correct and complete list as of the Agreement Date of the
Subsidiaries of the Company and their respective jurisdictions of
organization. Each of the Subsidiaries was formed by the Company. All of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable (in any jurisdiction
that recognizes such concepts), are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary
free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances (other
than shares owned by directors of a Subsidiary consistent with applicable
Legal Requirements, which to the knowledge of the Company are owned by such
directors free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted
Encumbrances), and are not subject to any preemptive right or right of first
refusal, other than in favor of the Company or a Subsidiary, created by
statute, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents, as applicable, of such Subsidiary or any
Contract to which the Company or such Subsidiary is a party or by which it is
bound. There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, "put" or
"call" rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other Contracts of
any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other
securities of any Subsidiary, or otherwise obligating the Company or any
Subsidiary to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or
sell any such securities. Other than the Subsidiaries, the Company does not
directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar
interest in, any Person. There are no outstanding obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under any Contract to which it is a party or by
which it is otherwise bound to make any loan to, or any equity or
other investment (in the form of a capital contribution or otherwise) in any
other Person (other than the Company or a Subsidiary) in an amount in excess
of $250,000 in respect of any single Person.

(c) The Company has made available to Parent or its counsel correct and
complete copies of the minute books containing records of all proceedings,
consents, actions and meetings of the Company Board, committees of the Company
Board and stockholders of the Company for the period from since the effective
date of the registration statement for the Companys initial public offering
(the "Effective Date") through the Agreement Date, which minute books of the
Company so made available contain accurate summaries of 



 

11  all meetings of, or actions by written consent by, directors and
stockholders of the Company, except in each case for (i) records that may
discuss the Merger and other strategic alternatives and (ii) draft minutes
pending approval by the Company Board or a committee of the Company Board. The
Company has made available to Parent or its counsel correct and complete
copies of the charters of all committees of the Company Board and all codes
of conduct, whistleblower policies, disclosure committee policy or similar
policies adopted by the Company Board, as in effect on the Agreement Date
unless the same are contained in unredacted exhibits to the Company SEC
Reports.

 

2.2 _Capital Structure_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists solely of (i)
250,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of
Company Preferred Stock. A total of 72,015,949 shares of Company Common Stock

Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. The Company has not designated,
authorized, or issued any other shares of capital stock. The Company holds no
shares of Company Common Stock in its treasury as of the Agreement Date. All
issued and outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are free of all
Encumbrances, preemptive rights, rights of first refusal and "put" or "call"
rights created by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the
Company or any agreement to which the Company is a party or by which it is
bound. As of the Agreement Date, the Company has reserved 24,991,850 shares
of Company Common Stock for issuance to employees, non-employee directors and
consultants pursuant to the Company Option Plans, of which 13,267,548 shares

unvested Company RSUs, and 1,399,909 shares remain available for issuance
thereunder. The Company has granted no Company Options or Company RSUs other
than pursuant to the Company Option Plans. As of the Agreement Date, except
for (i) the Companys right to repurchase any unvested shares of Company
Common Stock under the Company Option Plans, (ii) Company Options listed on
_Schedule 2.2(b)-2_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (iii) Company RSUs
listed on _Schedule 2.2(b)-4_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no
options, warrants, calls, rights or Contracts of any character to which the
Company is a party or by which it is bound obligating the Company to grant,
issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered,
sold, repurchased or redeemed, any shares of any capital stock of the Company,
any options or warrants to purchase capital stock of the Company, or any
Company Voting Debt. There is no liability for dividends accrued and unpaid by
the Company or any Subsidiary.

(b) _Schedule 2.2(b)-1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
correct and complete list as of the Agreement Date of all holders of any
Unvested Company Shares, including the number and kind of shares of Company
Capital Stock unvested as of the date of this Agreement, the purchase price
paid per share, the vesting schedule (and the terms of any acceleration
thereof) in effect for such Unvested Company Shares, the repurchase price
payable per unvested share and the length of the repurchase period following
the holders termination of service. _Schedule 2.2(b)-2_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct and complete list as of the Agreement
Date of all holders of outstanding Company Options, whether or not granted
under the Company Option Plans, including the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to each such option, the date of grant, the exercise or
vesting schedule, including the vesting commencement date (and the terms of
any acceleration thereof), the extent exercisable or issued as of the

(which Schedule shall be a subset of _Schedule 2.2(b)-2_ ) sets forth a
correct and complete list as of the Agreement Date of all holders of
outstanding Company Options that are held by Persons that are not employees of
the Company or any Subsidiary (including non-employee directors, consultants,
advisory board members, vendors, service providers or other similar persons).
In addition, _Schedule 2.2(b)-4_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
correct and complete list as of the Agreement Date of all holders of Company
RSUs including the number of shares of Company Common Stock remaining subject
to 



 

12  issuance under such Company RSUs, and the vesting schedule (and the terms of
any acceleration thereof) (and none of such Company RSUs have an applicable
exercise price per share). All issued and outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock and all outstanding Company Options and Company RSUs were
issued, and all repurchases of Company securities were made, in material
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, including federal
and state securities laws and all requirements set forth in applicable
Contracts. All shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Company Options
or under Company RSUs will, when issued, be validly issued in material
compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements, including federal and
state securities laws and all requirements set forth in applicable Contracts.
The Company is not under any obligation to register under the Securities Act
any of the presently outstanding securities of the Company or any Subsidiary
now outstanding or that may be subsequently issued.

(c) No Debt of the Company or any Subsidiary (i) having the right to vote on
any matters on which stockholders may vote (or which is convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having such right) or (ii) the value of which is
in any way based upon or derived from capital or voting stock of the Company
(collectively, "Company Voting Debt"), is issued or outstanding as of the
Agreement Date. _Schedule 2.2(c)_ to the Company Disclosure Letter accurately
lists as of the Agreement Date all Debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries
representing outstanding obligations in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate,
including, for each item of Debt, the agreement governing the Debt and the
interest rate, maturity date and any assets or properties securing such Debt.
All Debt may be prepaid at the Closing without penalty under the terms of the
agreements governing such Debt.

(d) Except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, there are no Contracts
relating to voting, purchase or sale of any Company Capital Stock between or
among the Company and any of its securityholders, other than written
Contracts granting the Company the right to purchase unvested shares upon
termination of employment or service. The terms of each of the Company Option
Plans and the applicable stock option agreements and restricted stock unit
award agreements permit the assumption by Parent of all outstanding Company
Options and Company RSUs, whether vested or unvested, as provided in this
Agreement, without the consent or approval of the holders of such
securities, the Company stockholders, or otherwise. _Schedule 2.2(d)_ to the

this Agreement and, subject to the Company Stockholder Approval (defined

been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming due authorization, execution, and delivery thereof by each of
the other parties hereto, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the
Company 



 

13  enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject only
to the effect, if any, of (i) applicable bankruptcy and other similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally, and (ii) Legal Requirements
governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies. The Company Board, by resolutions duly adopted (and not thereafter
modified or rescinded except as otherwise permitted by Section 5.3(d)-(e)) by
the unanimous vote of the full Company Board, has (i) approved and adopted
this Agreement and the Merger, (ii) determined that this Agreement and the
terms and conditions of the Merger and this Agreement are fair to, advisable
and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and (iii)
directed that the adoption of this Agreement be submitted to the Company
stockholders for consideration and recommended that all of the
Company stockholders adopt this Agreement. Subject to the accuracy of the
representation set forth in Section 3.4 hereof, the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of all shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding on the record date set for the meeting of the Companys
stockholders to adopt this Agreement (such approval, the "Company Stockholder
Approval," and such stockholders meeting, the "Company Stockholders Meeting")
is the only vote of the holders of capital stock of the Company necessary to
adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger under applicable Legal
Requirements, the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market and the
Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, (i) result
in the creation of any Encumbrance on any of the material properties or assets
of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (ii) conflict with, or result in any
violation of or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both), or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or loss of any benefit under, or require any consent, approval
or waiver from any Person pursuant to, (A) any provision of the Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents of the
Company or any Subsidiary, in each case as amended to date, (B) subject to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and compliance with the
requirements set forth in Section 2.3(c), any Legal Requirement applicable to
the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets,
or (C) any Material Contract (as defined in Section 2.18), other than, in the
case of (B) and (C) above, such conflicts, violations, defaults, Encumbrances,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations, losses, consents, approvals or
waivers as would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole.

(c) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required by or with
respect to the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except for (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger,
as provided in Section 1.4, (ii) such filings as may be required under the HSR
Act and any applicable foreign Antitrust Law (as defined in Section

securities laws or the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market, and
(v) such other consents, authorizations, filings, approvals, notices and
registrations which, if not obtained or made, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole or prevent, materially alter or materially delay any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Subject to the accuracy of the representation set forth in Section 3.4
hereof, the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby by the Company Board referred to in Section 2.3(a) constitute all of
the approvals that are necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement and
the Merger the restrictions on "business combinations" with "interested
stockholders" (each as defined in Section 203 of Delaware Law) set forth in
Section 203 of Delaware Law and represent the only actions necessary to ensure
that Section 203 of Delaware Law does not and will not apply to the
execution, delivery, or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger. No other state takeover or other similar statute or regulation is
applicable to this Agreement or the Merger that would interfere with the
consummation of the Merger.



 

14 2.4 _SEC Filings; Company Financial Statements_.

(a) The Company has filed on a timely basis all forms, statements, schedules,
reports and documents (including items incorporated by reference) required to
be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC since the Effective Date.
All such required forms, statements, schedules, reports and documents
(including those that Company may file subsequent to the Agreement Date) are
referred to herein as the "Company SEC Reports." As of their respective filing
dates, the Company SEC Reports (i) complied, or will comply when filed, with
the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may
be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such
Company SEC Reports, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the Agreement Date, then on the
date of such filing) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected prior to the
Agreement Date by a subsequently filed Company SEC Report. None of the
Subsidiaries is currently required to file any forms, reports or other
documents with the SEC under the Exchange Act.

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any related notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports (the
"Financial Statements"), including each Company SEC Report filed after the
Agreement Date until the Closing, at the time filed (i) complied or will
comply as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were or will be prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
unaudited interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form
10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly
presented or will fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates therein indicated and the consolidated results of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except
that the unaudited interim financial statements may not contain footnotes and
were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments. The
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2009
(the "Company Balance Sheet Date") contained in the Company SEC Reports is
hereinafter referred to as the "Company Balance Sheet." Except as disclosed in
the Financial Statements (for the avoidance of doubt excluding any risk
factors or forward-looking statements contained therein), since the Company
Balance Sheet Date, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liabilities
(absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) required under GAAP to be set
forth on a balance sheet which are, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the business, results of operations or financial condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except for: (i) liabilities
incurred from the Company Balance Sheet Date to the Agreement Date in the
Ordinary Course of Business, (ii) those reflected on, or adequately reserved
against in, the Company Balance Sheet, (iii) the fees and expenses of
investment bankers, attorneys, consultants, and accountants incurred in
connection with this Agreement, and (iv) liabilities incurred after the
Agreement Date that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as
reflected in the Financial Statements, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
is a party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item
303 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act ("Regulation S-K")).
All reserves that are set forth in or reflected in the Company Balance Sheet
have been established in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and are
adequate as of the Company Balance Sheet Date. At the Company Balance Sheet
Date, there were no material loss contingencies (as such term is used in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 ("Statement No. 5") issued
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in March 1975) that are not
adequately provided for in the Company Balance Sheet as required by Statement
No. 5\. The Financial Statements comply in all material respects with the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position
97-2 for the products covered by such standard. The Company has not had any
material dispute with any of its auditors regarding accounting matters or
policies during any of its past three full fiscal years or during the current
fiscal year that is currently outstanding or that resulted in a past
adjustment to, or any restatement of, the Financial Statements. The Financial
Statements are consistent in all material respects with the books and records
of the Company and each Subsidiary.



 

15 (c) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent a complete
and correct copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been
filed with the SEC but which are required to be filed, to agreements,
documents or other instruments which previously had been filed by the Company
with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as well as
any comment letters or similar correspondence received by the Company from the
SEC for the Companys three prior fiscal years and its current fiscal year.
The SEC has not provided comments to the Company in connection with any
Company SEC Reports that to the Companys knowledge remain unresolved. To the
knowledge of the Company, no investigation by the SEC with respect to the
Company or any Subsidiary is pending or threatened. 

(d) The Company has established and maintains (i) a system of internal
accounting controls that complies with Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange
Act, (ii) "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15
promulgated under the Exchange Act) required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act and such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
be effective for the purpose for which they were established, and (iii)
"internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15
promulgated under the Exchange Act) and such internal control over financial
reporting is designed to be effective (based on the criteria issued by the
Committee on Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Committee on "Internal
Control-Integrated Framework") in providing reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of
the Companys financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Each of the
principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOXA") and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company SEC Reports and the
statements contained in such certifications were true and accurate in all
material respects as of the date made. There are no "significant
deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as defined by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board) in the design or operation of the Companys
internal controls and procedures which could adversely affect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data. The Company
has adopted a code of ethics, as defined by Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K for
senior financial, accounting and compliance officers and those performing
similar functions. The Company has disclosed any violation or waiver of such
code of ethics, as required by Section 406(b) of SOXA. To the Companys
knowledge, there is no fraud or any material violation of the Companys code
of ethics that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls and procedures.

(e) The audit committee of the Company Board includes an "audit committee
financial expert," as defined by Item 401(h)(2) of Regulation S-K. To the
Companys knowledge, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which has expressed its
opinion with respect to the financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008 and for each of
the fiscal years then ended included in the Company SEC Reports (including the
related notes), is "independent" with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries within the meaning of Regulation S-X since the Effective Date.
The Company has made such disclosure of non-audit services performed by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in its proxy statements with respect to its annual
meetings of stockholders as is required under the rules and regulations of
the SEC and all such non-audit services have been approved in advance by the
audit committee of the Company Board.

(f) Since the Effective Date, neither the Company nor any Subsidiaries nor, to
Companys knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or
representative of the Company or any Subsidiary has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, in each case, regarding improper, wrongful, or
fraudulent accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of the Company or any Subsidiary or their respective internal
accounting controls or any material inaccuracy in the Companys financial
statements. No attorney representing the Company or any Subsidiary, whether or
not employed by the Company or any Subsidiary, has reported to the Company
Board or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of the Company
evidence of fraud or a material violation of securities laws or other Legal
Requirements, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Company or any
of its officers, directors, employees or agents.



 

16 (g) The Company is in compliance with the applicable criteria for
continued listing of the Company Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select
Market, including all applicable corporate governance rules and regulations.

(h) All Company Options and Company RSUs granted by the Company have been duly
and validly approved by (a) the Company Board, or by a duly constituted
committee of the Company Board to whom the administration of such awards
under the relevant Company Option Plan has been delegated, at a valid meeting
of such Board of Directors or committee or pursuant to a valid unanimous
written consent of the members of such Board of Directors or committee, or
(b) the Chief Executive Officer of the Company in cases where such officer has
been duly authorized by the Company Board to approve such awards. All grants
of Company Options and Company RSUs are in compliance with the terms of the
applicable Company Option Plan under which such Company Options and Company
RSUs were granted. The Company has not granted any Company Option or Company
RSU to any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the date of
commencement of employment of such employee with the Company or such
Subsidiary. The Company has not granted any Company Options at an exercise
price that represents a discount from the fair market value of such Company
Option on the valid date of grant of such Company Option and the Company has
validly disclosed any re-pricing of Company Options in its financial
statements. Neither the Company, its Affiliates, the Company Board, any
Company Board committee nor the Chief Executive Officer has engaged in (i)
the back-dating or falsification of documentation with respect to the grant of
any Company Option for the purpose of lowering the exercise price at which
such Company Option was granted, or (ii) the intentional delay of the grant
of Company Options in anticipation of forthcoming public announcements
regarding the Company or its business that could reasonably be expected to
result in an increase or decrease of the trading price of the Companys
capital stock on NASDAQ, in either case for the purpose of increasing the
value of such Company Options or Company RSUs for the relevant optionee as a
result of such change in such trading price. All Company Options and Company
RSUs have been properly accounted for in the Companys financial statements
and reported in compliance with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and, to the
Companys knowledge, there is no basis for any claim that the grant date of
any Company Option or Company RSUs is inaccurate. There is not pending or, to
the Companys knowledge, threatened, any investigation by the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority with respect to the Company Options or Company RSUs or
the grant practices of the Company.

that (i) would reasonably be expected to result in obligations or liabilities
of the Company or any Subsidiary in excess of $1,000,000 or (ii) would

payments to be made or received by the Company or any Subsidiary thereunder,
and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liability for breach of any

Intellectual Property Agreement.

(h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has been sued in any suit, action
or proceeding (or received any written notice or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threat) which involves a claim of infringement or misappropriation

validity, ownership or right of the Company or any Subsidiary to exercise any
Intellectual Property Right. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
received any written communication in the past five years that involves an

Intellectual Property Right of a third party, or that alleges that any Company
Products or the conduct of the Business infringes any Intellectual Property
Rights of any third party.

any product, device or process in the Company Products or the conduct of the
Business, has not infringed, misappropriated, or violated, does not and will
not infringe, misappropriate, or violate any Third Party Intellectual
Property, and does not constitute unfair competition or unfair trade practices
under the laws of any jurisdiction and there is no substantial basis for any
such claim. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written
or oral opinion of counsel that any Company Product or the operation of the
Business does or does not infringe, misappropriate, or violate any
Intellectual Property Right of a third party or that any Intellectual Property
Right of a third party is invalid or unenforceable.

affect the validity, use or enforceability of any such Company-Owned
Intellectual Property.

unrestricted and exclusive ownership of all Intellectual Property Rights in
such contributions and has obtained a waiver from each such Author of any
non-assignable rights. No such Author has retained any rights, licenses,

other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise proprietary work.

(m) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps
to protect and preserve the confidentiality of all confidential or trade

Property or grant, or purport to grant, to any third party, any rights or
immunities under any Company Intellectual Property Rights (including using any
Open Source Materials that require, as a condition of use, modification and/or
distribution of such Open Source Materials that other software incorporated

disclosed or distributed in source code form, (B) be licensed for the purpose
of making derivative works, or (C) be redistributable at no charge).

conform in all material respects to packaging, advertising and marketing
materials and to applicable product or service specifications or

to the knowledge of the Company and any Subsidiary, there is no legitimate
basis for any present or future action, suit, proceeding, hearing,

any Subsidiary, who was involved in, or who contributed to, the creation or

Source Code (other than providing Authors access to Company Source Code on a
"need to know" basis in connection with development of Company Source Code).
To the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred, and no circumstance or
condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
will, or would reasonably be expected to, result in the disclosure, delivery
or license by the Company or any Subsidiary or any Person then acting on their
behalf to any Person of any Company Source Code. Without limiting the
foregoing, neither the execution of this Agreement nor any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will result in release from escrow or other
delivery to a third party of any Company Source Code.

is no substantial basis to expect that there will be a future obligation) to
grant or offer to any other Person any license or right to any Company-

2.13 _Employee Benefit Plans and Employee Matters_.

(a) The Company has made available to Parent a correct and complete copy of
each of, with respect to the Company, any Subsidiary and any trade or
business (whether or not incorporated) which is treated as a single employer
with the Company (an "ERISA Affiliate") within the meaning of Section 414(b),
(c), 



 

28  (m) or (o) of the Code, (i) all material employee benefit plans within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), (ii) each loan to an employee in excess of
$50,000, (iii) all stock option, stock purchase, phantom stock, stock
appreciation right, supplemental retirement, severance, sabbatical, medical,
dental, vision care, disability, employee relocation, cafeteria benefit
(Section 125 of the Code), dependent care (Section 129 of the Code), life
insurance or accident insurance plans, programs or arrangements, (iv) all
bonus, pension, profit sharing, savings, severance retirement, deferred
compensation or incentive plans, programs or arrangements, (v) all other
fringe or employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements that apply to
senior management and that do not generally apply to all employees, (vi) any
employment or service agreements (except for offer letters providing for at-
will employment which do not provide for severance, acceleration or post-
termination benefits) compensation agreements, change in control agreements
or severance agreements, written or otherwise, for the benefit of, or
relating to, any present or former director, officer, employee, or consultant
(provided that, for former directors, officers, employees and consultants,
such agreements need only be listed if unsatisfied obligations of the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate of greater than $10,000 remain thereunder), and (v) any
other written or oral arrangement for the benefit of any employee under which
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has or may have material liability,
contingent or otherwise (all of the foregoing described in clauses (i) through
(v), collectively, the "Company Employee Plans"). Neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate has, since the initial filing date of the registration
statement for the Companys initial public offering, extended or maintained
credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed, modified or forgiven
an extension of credit made prior to such date, in the form of a personal
loan to or for any officer or director of the Company.

(b) The Company has made available to Parent a correct and complete copy of
each of the Company Employee Plans and related plan documents (including trust
documents, insurance policies or Contracts, employee booklets, summary plan
descriptions and other authorizing documents, and any material employee
communications relating thereto) and, with respect to each Company Employee
Plan that is subject to ERISA reporting requirements, has made available to
Parent correct and complete copies of the Form 5500 reports filed for
the last three plan years. Any Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has either obtained from the Internal Revenue
Service a favorable determination letter as to its qualified status under the
Code, including all amendments to the Code effected by the Tax Reform Act of
1986 and subsequent legislation, or has applied (or has time remaining in
which to apply) to the Internal Revenue Service for such a determination
letter prior to the expiration of the requisite period under applicable
Treasury Regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in which to
apply for such determination letter and to make any amendments necessary to
obtain a favorable determination or has been established under a prototype
plan for which an Internal Revenue Service opinion letter has been obtained or
is pending by the plan sponsor and is valid as to the adopting employer. The
Company has also made available to Parent a correct and complete copy of the
most recent Internal Revenue Service determination or opinion letter issued
with respect to each such Company Employee Plan or its related prototype, and
nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such letter that would
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the Tax-qualified status of any
Company Employee Plan subject to Section 401(a) of the Code. The Company has
also made available to Parent all registration statements and prospectuses
prepared in connection with each Company Employee Plan that are not part of
the Company SEC Reports. To the knowledge of the Company, all individuals who,
pursuant to the terms of any Company Employee Plan, are entitled to
participate in any Company Employee Plan, are currently participating in such
Company Employee Plan or have been offered an opportunity to do so and have
declined in writing.

(c) None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or
other retiree welfare benefits to any person other than as required under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA")
or similar state law. There has been no "prohibited transaction" (within the
meaning of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and not exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA and regulatory guidance thereunder) with respect
to any Company Employee Plan that would reasonably be expected to result in
material liability to the Company. Each Company Employee Plan has been
administered in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the
requirements prescribed by any 



 

29  and all statutes, rules and regulations (including ERISA and the Code), and
the Company, each Subsidiary and each ERISA Affiliate has performed all
obligations required to be performed by it under, is not in default under or
in violation of, and the Company has no knowledge of any default or violation
by any other party to, any of the Company Employee Plans. Neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is subject to any material liability or
material penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of
ERISA with respect to any of the Company Employee Plans. All contributions
required to be made by the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate to
any Company Employee Plan have been made in material compliance with any
applicable requirements on or before their due dates and a reasonable amount
has been accrued for contributions to each Company Employee Plan for the
current plan years (and no further contributions will be due or will have
accrued thereunder as of the Closing Date, other than contributions accrued in
the Ordinary Course of Business after the Company Balance Sheet Date as a
result of the operations of Company and its Subsidiaries after the Company
Balance Sheet Date). In addition, with respect to each Company Employee Plan
intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement, the Company, its
Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates have materially complied with any
requirements with respect to deposits of employee salary reduction
contributions and participant loan repayments, as determined pursuant to
regulations issued by the United States Department of Labor. Each Company
Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the
Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without material liability to
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary (other than ordinary
administrative expenses typically incurred in a termination event, premium
expenses and expenses incurred by virtue of plan year changes). No suit,
administrative proceeding, action or other litigation has been brought, or to
the knowledge of the Company, is threatened, against or with respect to any
such Company Employee Plan (other than routine claims for benefits and
qualified domestic relations orders), including any audit or inquiry by the
Internal Revenue Service or United States Department of Labor that would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

(d) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company, any Subsidiary or other ERISA
Affiliate relating to, or change in participation or coverage under, any
Company Employee Plan that would materially increase the expense of
maintaining such Company Employee Plan above the level of expense incurred
with respect to such Company Employee Plan for the most recent fiscal year
included in the Financial Statements. No Company Employee Plan will be subject
to any surrender fees or service fees upon termination that would be material
to the Company other than the normal and reasonable administrative fees
associated with the termination of benefit plans.

(e) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or current or former ERISA
Affiliate currently maintains, sponsors, participates in or contributes to,
or has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, or
contributed to, any pension plan (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA)
that is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

(f) The actuarial present values of all (i) accrued deferred compensation
entitlements (including entitlements under any executive compensation,
supplemental retirement, or employment agreement), and (ii) all liabilities
associated with post-employment welfare benefits (including any retiree
health benefits and life insurance) of employees and former employees of the
Company, its ERISA Affiliates and their respective beneficiaries, have been
fully reflected on the Financial Statements to the extent required by and in
accordance with GAAP. 

(g) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate is a party to,
or has made any contribution to or otherwise incurred any obligation under
any "multiple employer plan" as such term is defined in Section 413(c) of the
Code.

(h) Each material compensation and benefit plan maintained or contributed to
by the Company or any Subsidiary under the law or applicable custom or rule of
the relevant jurisdiction outside of the United States (each such plan, a
"Foreign Plan") as of the Agreement Date is listed in _Schedule 2.13(h)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter. As regards each Foreign Plan, (i) such Foreign
Plan is in material compliance 



 

30  with the provisions of the Legal Requirements of each jurisdiction in which
such Foreign Plan is maintained, to the extent those Legal Requirements are
applicable to such Foreign Plan, (ii) all contributions to, and material
payments from, such Foreign Plan which may have been required to be made in
accordance with the terms of such Foreign Plan, and, when applicable, the
Legal Requirements of the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Plan is
maintained, have been timely made or shall be made by the Closing Date, and
all such contributions to such Foreign Plan, and all payments under such
Foreign Plan, for any period ending before the Closing Date that are not yet,
but will be, required to be made, are reflected as an accrued liability on
the Company Balance Sheet where required to be by applicable principles of
financial reporting, (iii) the Company, each Subsidiary, and each ERISA
Affiliate has materially complied with all applicable reporting and notice
requirements, and such Foreign Plan has obtained from the Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction with respect to such Foreign Plan any required
determinations, if any, that such Foreign Plan is in compliance with the
Legal Requirements of the relevant jurisdiction if such determinations are
required in order to give effect to such Foreign Plan, (iv) such Foreign Plan
has been administered in all material respects at all times in accordance
with its terms and applicable Legal Requirements, (v) to the knowledge of the
Company, there are no pending investigations by any governmental body
involving such Foreign Plan, and no pending claims (except for claims for
benefits payable in the normal operation of such Foreign Plan), suits or
proceedings against such Foreign Plan or asserting any rights or claims to
benefits under such Foreign Plan, (vi) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not by itself create or otherwise result
in any liability with respect to such Foreign Plan, and (vii) to the knowledge
of the Company, except as required by applicable Legal Requirements, no
condition exists that would prevent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
from terminating or amending any Foreign Plan at any time for any reason in
accordance with the terms of each such Foreign Plan without the payment of any
fees, costs or expenses (other than the payment of benefits accrued on the
Company Balance Sheet and any normal and reasonable expenses typically
incurred in a termination event). No Foreign Plan has unfunded Liabilities in
any material amount that will not be offset by insurance or that are
not fully accrued on the financial statements of the Company. With respect to
Foreign Plans, the representations in Section 2.13 shall be made exclusively
under this subsection (h).

(i) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or any termination of
employment or service or any other event in connection therewith or subsequent
thereto will, individually, in the aggregate or with the occurrence of some
other event (i) result in any material payment (including severance,
unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due
to any Person, (ii) materially increase or otherwise enhance any benefits
otherwise payable by the Company or any Subsidiary, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits, except as
required under Section 411(d)(3) of the Code, (iv) materially increase the
amount of compensation due to any Person, or (v) result in the forgiveness in
whole or in part of any outstanding loans made by the Company or any
Subsidiary to any Person.

(j) Each of the Company and each Subsidiary is in compliance in all material
respects with all currently applicable Legal Requirements respecting
employment, discrimination in employment, terms and conditions of employment,
worker classification (including the proper classification of workers as
independent contractors and consultants), wages, hours and occupational safety
and health and employment practices, including the Immigration Reform and
Control Act, and is not engaged in any unfair labor practice. The Company and
each Subsidiary has materially complied with any requirement to pay employees,
independent contractors and consultants all wages, salaries, commissions,
bonuses, benefits, and other compensation due to or on behalf of such
employees, independent contractors and consultants. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has any material unpaid liability to any trust or other fund or
to any Governmental Entity, with respect to unemployment compensation
benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations for employees
(other than routine payments to be made in the normal course of business and
consistently with past practice). To the knowledge of the Company, there are
no pending claims against the Company and/or any Subsidiary under any workers
compensation plan or policy or for long term disability. Neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary has any obligations under COBRA with respect to any former
employees or qualifying beneficiaries thereunder, except for obligations that
are not material in amount. There are no 



 

31  controversies pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
between the Company or any Subsidiary and any of their respective employees,
which controversies have or would reasonably be expected to result in an
action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation before any
Governmental Entity that would be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(k) _Schedule 2.13(k)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a correct
and complete list as of the Agreement Date of all severance Contracts and
employment Contracts to which the Company and/or any Subsidiary is a party or
by which the Company and/or any Subsidiary is bound pursuant to which the
Company has or may have continuing material liability or ongoing material

any Subsidiary has knowledge of any activities or proceedings of any labor

default or event, occurrence, condition or act, with respect to the Company or
any Subsidiary or to the knowledge of the Company, with respect to any other
contracting party, which, with or without the giving of notice or the lapse
of time, would reasonably be expected to (i) become a material default or
event of default under any Material Contract, or (ii) give any third party (A)
the right to declare a material default or exercise any remedy under any
Material Contract, (B) the right to accelerate the maturity or performance of
any material obligation of the Company or any Subsidiary under any Material
Contract, or (C) the right to cancel, terminate or modify any Material
Contract. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any written or,
to the knowledge of the Company, oral, notice regarding any actual or possible
material violation or breach of, material default under, or intention to
cancel or modify any Material Contract. Correct and complete copies of all
Material Contracts have been made available to Parent prior to the Agreement
Date.

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, with respect to any Government Contract,
there is, as of the Agreement Date, neither an existing nor a basis for a:
(i) civil fraud or criminal investigation by any Governmental Entity; (ii)

Civil 



 

36  False Claims Act; (iii) suspension or debarment proceeding (or equivalent
proceeding) against the Company or any Subsidiary; (iv) claim or request by a

defective pricing; disallowance of cost or non compliance with statute,
regulation or contract; (v) dispute involving the Company or any Subsidiary on

transactions that may give rise to any future claims; and

required, or such consents and approvals can be obtained expeditiously
without material cost.

2.20 _Fairness Opinion_. The Company Board has received an opinion from
Goldman Sachs to the effect that, as of the Agreement Date, and based upon and
subject to the matters and the limitations set forth therein, the Per-Share
Cash Amount to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock (other than any
shares of Company Common Stock the consideration for which will be or become
subject to vesting or similar requirements) is fair to such holders from a
financial point of view (the "Fairness Opinion"). Upon the Companys receipt
of the written version of the Fairness Opinion, the Company shall promptly
provide to Parent a copy of such written version solely for informational
purposes.

2.21 _Information Supplied_. The preliminary and definitive proxy statements
to be filed by the Company with the SEC in connection with the Merger
(collectively, the "Proxy Statement") shall not, on each relevant filing date,

Meeting for the sole purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval
(including any adjournment of such meeting for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval). 



 

44  Except as communicated in a Change of Recommendation (as defined below)
effected in compliance with Section 5.3, the Company will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the

The NASDAQ Stock Market, Delaware Law and its Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws. The Company (i) shall consult with Parent regarding the date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, and (ii) shall not postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting (A) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is necessary
(which determination shall not be made until after consultation with Parent,
except with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or as otherwise provided in
Sections 5.3(d)-(f)) is provided to the Companys stockholders in advance of a
vote on the Merger and this Agreement, (B) if, as of the time that the Company
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares
of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (C) if, as of the time that the Company Stockholders
Meeting is originally scheduled, adjournment of the Company Stockholders
Meeting is necessary to enable the Company to solicit additional proxies if
there are not sufficient votes in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval,
or (D) as required to provide for the expiration of any time period required
in Sections 5.3(d)-(f).

(b)  _Board Recommendation_. Subject to Section 5.3(d)-(f): (i) the Company
Board shall recommend that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of the
Company Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholders Meeting
(the "Company Board Recommendation"); (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include
a statement to the effect that the Company Board has recommended that the
Companys stockholders vote in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval
at the Company Stockholders Meeting; and (iii) neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify, or
publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in
a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Company Board that the
Companys stockholders vote in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval.

(c) _Continuing Obligation_. Until the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Companys obligation to call, give notice or
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with this

disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any Acquisition
Proposal, or Superior Offer, or by any Change of Recommendation (as defined
in Section 5.3(d) below).

5.3 _No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) _No Solicitation Generally_. Subject to Section 5.3(c), (d) and (f), from
and after the Agreement Date until the earlier of the Effective Time and
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, the Company and its
Subsidiaries will not, nor will they authorize or permit any of their
respective officers, directors, Affiliates or employees or any investment
banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained by any of them
(all of the foregoing collectively being the "Company Representatives") to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit or initiate, or knowingly encourage,
knowingly facilitate or knowingly induce, the making, submission or public
announcement of any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii) enter into, participate
in, maintain or continue any communications (except solely to provide written
notice as to the existence of these provisions) or negotiations regarding, or
deliver or make available to any Person any non-public information with
respect to, or take any other action knowingly facilitating, any inquiry,
expression of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) agree to,
accept, approve, endorse or recommend (or publicly propose or announce any
intention or desire to agree to, accept, approve, endorse or recommend) any
Acquisition 



 

45  Proposal, (iv) enter into any letter of intent or any other Contract
(whether binding or not) contemplating or otherwise relating to any
Acquisition Proposal, (v) submit any Acquisition Proposal to the vote of any
stockholders of the Company or any Subsidiary, or (vi) grant any waiver or
release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to the Company
or the Subsidiaries, or any class of equity securities of the Company or the
Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries will immediately cease any and
all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted prior to
or on the Agreement Date with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished to any Person with which the Company has engaged in any
such activities within the 12-month period preceding the Agreement Date. The
Company and its Subsidiaries shall enforce (and shall not, nor permit any
Subsidiary to, waive) any rights under any standstill or similar agreements to
which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party. If any Company Representative
takes any action that the Company is obligated pursuant to this Section 5.3
not to permit such Company Representative to take, then the Company shall be
deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have breached this Section 5.3.

"Acquisition Proposal" shall mean, with respect to the Company, any agreement,
offer, proposal or indication of interest (other than this Agreement, the
Merger or any other offer, proposal or indication of interest by Parent), or
any public announcement of intention to enter into any such agreement or of
(or intention to make) any offer, proposal or indication of interest,
relating to, or involving: (A) purchase from the Company or any acquisition by
any Person or Group of more than a 15% interest in the total outstanding
voting securities of the Company or any tender offer or exchange offer that
if consummated would result in any Person or Group beneficially owning 15% or
more of the total outstanding voting securities of the Company, or any merger,
consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately
preceding such transaction hold securities representing less than 85% of the
total outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity of such
transaction (or parent entity of such surviving or resulting entity); (B) any
sale, acquisition, or disposition of more than 15% of the total assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in any single transaction or series of related
transactions; or (C) any liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

(b) _Notice_. The Company as promptly as practicable (but in no event
more than one Business Day after receipt) shall advise Parent orally and in
writing of (A) an Acquisition Proposal or (B) any request for non-public
information which would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, as well as, in the event of any of (A)-(B) above, the material
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or request, and the identity
of the Person or Group making any such Acquisition Proposal or request. The
Company will keep Parent informed as promptly as practicable (but in no event
more than one Business Day after receipt) of any material changes (including
any material amendments or modifications or proposed material amendments or
modifications) to any such Acquisition Proposal or request, and provide to
Parent as promptly as practicable (but in no event more than one Business Day
after receipt) a summary of the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal or request (including any material amendments
or modifications or proposed material amendments or modifications). The
Company shall provide Parent with prior notice of any meeting of the Company
Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected to discuss any
Acquisition Proposal, including to determine whether such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Offer (as defined in Section 5.3(c)).

(c)  _Superior Offers_. In the event that any Person submits to the Company
after the Agreement Date (and does not withdraw) an unsolicited, written, bona
fide Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national standing) is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Offer, then notwithstanding Section 5.3(a), the Company may, so long as the
Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained, (i) enter into
discussions with such Person regarding such Acquisition Proposal, and (ii)
deliver or make available to such Person non-public information regarding the
Company and its Subsidiaries, _provided_ , in the case of each such
Acquisition Proposal, that the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives comply with each of the following: (A) neither the Company,
any Subsidiary nor any Company Representative shall have violated any of the
provisions of this Section 5.3 in any material 



 

46  respect, (B) prior to making available to such Person any material non-
public information, the Company first shall have received from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive
with regard to the Companys confidential information as the Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined in Section 5.5), which confidentiality agreement shall
not include any provision for any exclusive right to negotiate with such
Person or having the actual or purported effect of restricting the Company
from fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement and shall require such
Person to agree to customary employee non-solicitation and "standstill"
provisions covering at least 12 months from execution of such confidentiality
agreement, (C) the Company first shall have given Parent advance written
notice of its intent to take such actions, and (D) prior to
or contemporaneously with delivering or making available any such non-public
information to such Person, the Company shall deliver or make available such
non-public information to Parent (to the extent such non-public information
has not been previously delivered or made available by the Company to
Parent).

"Superior Offer" shall mean, with respect to the Company, an unsolicited,
bona fide written offer made after the Agreement Date by a third party (a) to
acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer,
merger, consolidation or other business combination (including by means of a
tender offer followed promptly by a back-end merger) beneficial ownership of
more than 50% of the assets of the Company or more than 50% of the total
outstanding voting securities of the Company and as a result of which the
stockholders of the Company immediately preceding such transaction would hold
less than 50% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of
such transaction or any direct or indirect parent or subsidiary thereof, (b)
for consideration consisting exclusively of cash and/or SEC-registered
securities, and (c) that the Company Board has concluded in good faith
(following consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor
of national standing), taking into account, among other things, all legal,
financial, regulatory, timing and other aspects of the offer, including
conditions to consummation and the Person making the offer, in each case
deemed relevant by the Company Board (i) would be, if consummated, more
favorable to the Companys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders)
than the terms of this Agreement (after giving effect to any adjustments to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
Acquisition Proposal) and (ii) is reasonably likely to be consummated on the
terms proposed.

(d) _Change of Recommendation for Superior Offer_. Nothing in this Agreement
shall prevent the Company Board from withholding, withdrawing, qualifying,
amending or modifying its recommendation to the Companys stockholders to
vote in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval (a "Change of
Recommendation") if:

(i) the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained;

(ii) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with the
provisions and requirements set forth in Section 5.2 and this Section 5.3;

(iii) a Superior Offer is made to the Company that is not withdrawn and
continues to be a Superior Offer and is set forth in a final and definitive
written agreement submitted irrevocably to the Company (the "Definitive Third
Party Agreement");

(iv) the Company shall have provided to Parent four Business Days prior
written notice (a "Notice of Superior Offer") which shall state expressly (1)
that the Company has received a Superior Offer, (2) the material terms and
conditions of the Superior Offer and the identity of the Person or group
of Persons making the Superior Offer, and (3) that it intends to effect a
Change of Recommendation and such manner and timing in which it intends to do
so, and shall have provided Parent with a copy of the Definitive Third Party
Agreement concurrently with the delivery of the Notice of Superior Offer;

(v) the Company shall have during the four Business Day period referred to in
subsection (iv) above, if requested by Parent, made the Company
Representatives available to discuss with Parents representatives any
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the Parent
desires to propose such that the Superior Offer would cease to constitute a
Superior Offer;



 

47 (vi) Parent shall not have, within four Business Days of Parents receipt of
the Notice of Superior Offer, made a written, binding and irrevocable (through
the expiration of such four Business Day period) offer that the Company Board
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
a financial advisor of national standing) to be at least as favorable to the
Companys stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) as such Superior
Offer (it being agreed that (A) the Company Board shall convene a meeting to
consider any such offer by Parent promptly following the receipt thereof, (B)
that the Company Board will not effect a Change of Recommendation for four
Business Days after receipt by Parent of the Notice of Superior Offer and the
Definitive Third Party Agreement, and (C) any change to the financial or
other material terms of such Superior Offer shall require a new Notice of
Superior Offer to Parent and a new four Business Day period under this
subsection (vi)); and

(vii) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel), that, in light of such Superior Offer and any
offer made by Parent pursuant to subsection (vi) above, that the failure to
make a Change of Recommendation is reasonably likely to result in a breach of
its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Legal Requirements.

(e) _Change of Recommendation for Intervening Event_. Nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company Board from making a Change of
Recommendation for a reason unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any Change of Recommendation proposed to be made in
response to an Acquisition Proposal may only be made pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of Section 5.3(d)) if:

(i) the Company Stockholder Approval has not yet been obtained;

(ii) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with the
provisions and requirements set forth in Section 5.2 and this Section 5.3;

(iii) the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that, in light of material facts, events and/or
circumstances that have developed since the Agreement Date which were
previously unknown by the Company and which were not reasonably foreseeable
as of the Agreement Date (an "Intervening Event") and taking into account the
results of any discussions with Parent as contemplated by subsection (iv)
below and any offer from Parent contemplated by subsection (v) below, the
failure to make a Change of Recommendation is reasonably likely to result in a
breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt,
any determination by the Company Board after the Agreement Date that the Per-
Share Cash Amount payable in the Merger is not sufficient shall not in and of
itself constitute an Intervening Event;

(iv) the Company has provided to Parent at least four Business Days prior
written notice that the Company Board intends to make a Change of
Recommendation ("Notice of Intervening Event") and if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have made the Company Representatives available during the four
Business Day period to discuss with Parents representatives (A) the facts,
events and circumstances underlying such proposed Change of Recommendation and
the Company Boards reason for proposing to effect such Change of
Recommendation and (B) any modifications to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement that the Parent desires to propose that that would obviate the need
for the Company Board to effect such Change of Recommendation; and

(v) Parent shall not have, within the aforementioned four Business Day period,
made a written, binding and irrevocable (through the expiration of such four
Business Day period) offer that the Company Board concludes in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
national standing) would obviate the need for the Company Board to effect
such Change of Recommendation (it being agreed that (A) the Company Board
shall convene a meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly
following the receipt thereof, (B) the Company Board will 



 

48  not effect a Change of Recommendation for four Business Days after receipt
by Parent of the Notice of Intervening Event, and (C) any change in the facts,
events or circumstances related to the Intervening Event shall require a new
Notice of Intervening Event to Parent and a new four Business Day period and
discussion process under subsection (iv) above).

(f) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A, promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if
the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to make such disclosure is reasonably
likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements (a "Required Fiduciary
Disclosure"); _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) any "stop, look, and listen"
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act, and any substantially similar communication that solely constitutes a
recitation of the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been received and a
factual description of the terms and background thereof, and that no position
has been taken by the Company Board as to the advisability or desirability of
such Acquisition Proposal, shall not be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation, (y) such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Change
of Recommendation if the Required Fiduciary Disclosure relates to an
Acquisition Proposal and the text of such Required Fiduciary Disclosure
includes a public statement that the Company Board is expressly reaffirming
the Company Board Recommendation, and (z) the Company Board shall not
recommend that the Companys stockholders tender shares of Company Capital
Stock in connection with any tender or exchange offer, or effect a Change of
Recommendation in connection with an Acquisition Proposal unless specifically
permitted to do so pursuant to Section 5.3(d).

5.4 _Access to Information_. 

(a) During the period commencing on the Agreement Date and continuing until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, (i)
the Company shall afford Parent and its accountants, counsel and other
representatives, reasonable access during business hours to (A) all of the
properties, books, Contracts and records of the Company and each Subsidiary,
and (B) all other information concerning the business, results of operations,
product development efforts, properties (tangible and intangible, including
Intellectual Property) and personnel of the Company or any Subsidiary as
Parent may reasonably request, and (ii) the Company shall, promptly upon
request, provide to Parent and its accountants, counsel and other
representatives correct and complete copies of the following documents of the
Company and each Subsidiary which it has in its possession (A) internal
financial statements and documentation regarding internal controls, (B) Tax
Returns, Tax elections and all other records and workpapers relating to Taxes,
(C) a schedule of any deferred intercompany gain with respect to transactions
to which the Company or any Subsidiary has been a party, and (D) receipts for
any Taxes paid to foreign Tax Authorities, _provided_ , _however_ , that
Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that (X) such access
would violate or result in the loss or material impairment of any information
subject to the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine
or (Y) any Legal Requirement applicable to Company or a Subsidiary or the
terms of any Material Contract requires that such party restrict or prohibit
access to any such properties or information.

(b) Subject to compliance with applicable Legal Requirements, from the
Agreement Date until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the
Effective Time, the Company shall notify Parent of, and confer from time to
time as requested by Parent with one or more representatives of Parent to
discuss, any material changes or developments in the operational matters
of the Company and each Subsidiary and the general status of the ongoing
operations of the Company and each Subsidiary.

(c) No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this
Section 5.4 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
hereto to consummate the Merger.



 

49 5.5 _Confidentiality; Public Disclosure_.

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously
executed an Amended and Restated Confidentiality Agreement dated October 1,
2009 (as may be amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"),
which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

(b) Parent and the Company have agreed to the text of the initial press
release announcing the signing of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Except with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or as
otherwise provided in Section 5.3, the Company shall consult to the fullest
extent practicable and discuss in good faith with Parent the form and content
of any press release, public statement or other public communication regarding
the Merger prior to its release and shall consider in good faith any
reasonable changes which are suggested by Parent prior to releasing or making
such press release, public statement or public communication. The Company
shall cause its employees, officers and directors to comply with this Section
5.5. Parent shall consult in good faith with the Company on its general
communications strategy for customers, suppliers and employees regarding the
Merger.

5.6 _Regulatory Approvals_.

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly after the execution of this
Agreement apply for or otherwise seek, and use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, all consents and approvals required to be obtained by it for the
consummation of the Merger. Without limiting the generality or effect of the
foregoing, each of Parent and the Company shall, as soon as practicable, make
any initial filings required under the HSR Act, and any other additional
filings required by the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act,
as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any
other applicable federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations,
orders or decrees that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). The parties shall promptly supply one
another with any information that may be required in order to obtain the
aforementioned consents and approvals. The parties hereto shall (i) consult
and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one
another, in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or
on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or
relating to the HSR Act or any foreign or other Antitrust Law, (ii) coordinate
with one another in preparing and exchanging such materials, and (iii)
promptly provide one another (and its counsel) with copies of all
filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral
presentations) made by a party to any Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement; _provided_ , that with respect to any such analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions, or
proposals or such filings, presentations or submissions, each of Parent and
the Company need not supply the other (or its counsel) with copies (or in case
of oral presentations, a summary) to the extent that any applicable Legal
Requirement requires such party or its subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit
access to any such properties or information.

(b) Each party will notify the other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any
comments from any officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any
filings made pursuant hereto, and (ii) any request by any officials of any
Governmental Entity for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant
to, or information provided to comply in all material respects with, any Legal
Requirements. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 5.6(a), each
party will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in
filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any applicable Antitrust Laws. Each of Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
with respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution
of this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall take any and all of the
following actions to the extent 



 

50  necessary to obtain the approval of any Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable laws regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby: (i) entering into negotiations; (ii)
providing information required by applicable Legal Requirements or
governmental regulation; and (iii) substantially complying with any "second
request" for information pursuant to the Antitrust Laws. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Antitrust Law, it is expressly understood and agreed that:
(i) Parent shall not have any obligation to litigate or contest any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent; and
(ii) Parent shall be under no obligation to make proposals, execute or carry
out agreements or submit to orders providing for a Divestiture.

"Divestiture" shall mean (1) the sale, license or other disposition or
holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any
assets or categories of assets of Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, (2) the imposition of any limitation or restriction on
the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to freely conduct their
business or the business of the Company or its Affiliates or own such assets,
or (3) the holding separate of the shares of Company Capital Stock or any
limitation or regulation on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to
exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of Company Capital Stock.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.6 shall limit a partys right to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) so long as such party has until such date
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 5.6.

5.7 _Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the different efforts standard of Section
5.6(a) and (c) and the limitations set forth in Section 5.6(d), each of the
parties hereto agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts, and to cooperate
with each other party hereto, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, appropriate or
desirable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including (a) taking all reasonable actions necessary to satisfy
the respective conditions set forth in Article VI, and (b) executing and
delivering such other instruments and doing and performing such other acts and
things as may be necessary or reasonably desirable to effect completely the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

5.8 _Third Party Consents; Notices_.

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts (not to require a
concession or expenditure) to obtain prior to the Closing, and deliver to
Parent at or prior to the Closing, all consents, waivers and approvals under
each Contract listed or described on _Schedule 2.3(b)_ or _Schedule 2.3(c)_
(and any Contract entered into after the Agreement Date that would have been
required to be listed or described on _Schedule 2.3(b)_ or _Schedule 2.3(c)_
if entered into prior to the Agreement Date) as reasonably specified by
Parent, using a form reasonably acceptable to Parent.

(b) The Company shall give all notices and other information required to be
given to the employees of the Company or any Subsidiary under any applicable
Legal Requirements in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

5.9  _Notice of Certain Matters_. The Company will exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to notify Parent in writing promptly after obtaining
knowledge of: (i) any written notice or written other communication from any
Person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger; (ii) any written notice or other written
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger;
(iii) any action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or
investigation by or before any Governmental Entity or arbitrator initiated by
or against it or any of its Subsidiaries, or known by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to be threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, 



 

51  officers, employees or shareholders in their capacity as such, or of any
written correspondence from any Person asserting or threatening a claim
against the Company or with respect to any of its assets or properties
(including Intellectual Property) that is, or is reasonably likely to be,
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iv) any
claim, or any written inquiry by any Taxing Authority, regarding a
material deficiency to pay Taxes payable by the Company; or (v) any event
that occurs after the date of this Agreement, that had it occurred prior to
the date of this Agreement, would have constituted an exception to the
representation set forth in Section 2.4(f). The Company will notify Parent in
writing promptly after learning of any change, occurrence or event which is
reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions to closing set forth in
Article VI not to be satisfied. No notification given under this Section 5.9
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties herein or affect the satisfaction or non-satisfaction of any
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent.

5.10 _Employees_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
ensure that the Continuing Employees located in the United States ("U.S.
Continuing Employees") shall receive health and welfare benefits that in the
aggregate for each such employee are no less favorable than those provided to
a similarly situated employee of Parent or its Affiliates who is not a U.S.
Continuing Employee taking into account the employees performance and
geographic location.

(b) Except to the extent necessary to avoid the duplication of benefits,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its other Affiliates to
recognize the service of each U.S. Continuing Employee with the Company or
its Affiliates before the Effective Time as if such service had been performed
with Parent or its Affiliates for all purposes under the vacation and
severance plans maintained by Parent or its Affiliates after the Effective
Time and for the purposes of eligibility and vesting under all other employee
benefit plans, programs and agreements maintained by Parent or its Affiliates
after the Effective Time (in each case, to the extent such plans, programs, or
agreements are made available to the U.S. Continuing Employees, as determined
by Parent).

(c) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliates
in which U.S. Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its other Affiliates, to the extent permitted by the relevant welfare plan,
to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and exclusions with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees to the extent such conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did
not apply to such employees under the welfare plans maintained by the Company
or its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each such
employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan.

5.11  _Assumption of Options and Certain Other Matters_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each Rollover Option held by a Continuing Employee
that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, be assumed by Parent. Each such Rollover Option
so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the same terms and conditions (including, if applicable, the
vesting arrangements and other terms and conditions set forth in the Company
Option Plan that such Rollover Option was granted under and the applicable
stock option agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that (i) such option shall be exercisable for that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the
next whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, with no cash being payable
for any fractional share eliminated by such rounding) of the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Option Exchange Ratio, (ii)
the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such assumed option shall be equal to the quotient (rounded
up to the next whole cent) obtained by dividing the 



 

52  exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange
Ratio, (iii) no assumed Rollover Option may be "early exercised" ( _i.e._ ,
an assumed Rollover Option may be exercised for shares of Parent Common Stock
only to the extent such assumed Rollover Option is vested at the time of
exercise pursuant to the applicable vesting schedule), and (iv) Parents
board of directors or a committee thereof shall succeed to the authority of
the Company Board or any committee thereof with respect to the Rollover
Options and Company Option Plans. It is the intent of the parties that to the
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, all assumed options in
respect of Rollover Options that prior to the Effective Time were treated as
incentive or non-qualified stock options under the Code shall from and
after the Effective Time continue to be treated as incentive or non-qualified
stock options, respectively, under the Code. The Merger shall not terminate
any of the outstanding Rollover Options or accelerate the exercisability or
vesting of such options or the shares of Parent Common Stock which shall be
subject to those options upon Parents assumption of such options in the
Merger. Promptly after the Closing Date, Parent shall issue to each Person who
immediately prior to the Effective Time was a holder of an outstanding
Rollover Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such option
by Parent.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Rollover RSU that is outstanding as of the
Effective Time shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, be assumed by Parent. Each such Rollover RSU so assumed by
Parent under this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions (including, if applicable, the vesting arrangements
and other terms and conditions set forth in the Company Option Plan that such
Rollover RSU was granted under and the applicable award agreement) as are in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) such Rollover
RSU shall be for that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to
the product (rounded down to the next whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock, with no cash being payable for any fractional share eliminated by such
rounding) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable
under such Rollover RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and the
Option Exchange Ratio and (ii) Parents board of directors or a committee
thereof shall succeed to the authority of the Company Board or any committee
thereof with respect to the Rollover RSUs and the Company Option Plans.
The Merger shall not terminate any of the outstanding Rollover RSUs or
accelerate the vesting of such Rollover RSUs or the shares of Parent Common
Stock which shall be subject to those Rollover RSUs upon Parents assumption
of the Rollover RSUs in the Merger. Promptly after the Closing Date, Parent
shall issue to each Person who immediately prior to the Effective Time was a
holder of an outstanding Rollover RSU a document evidencing the foregoing
assumption of such Rollover RSU by Parent. 

(c) On or about the date which is five Business Days prior to the expected
date on which the Closing will occur, the Company shall deliver to Parent a
revised list of each Person who the Company reasonably believes is, with
respect to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, a "disqualified individual"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder), and each agreement the Company reasonably believes
would give rise to non-deductibility under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.

(d) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
Rollover Options and under the Rollover RSUs assumed by Parent for which a
Form S-8 registration statement is available as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing.

(e) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Companys 2007 Stock
Incentive Plan (the "Specified Target Plan") and all unissued shares reserved
for future issuance (the "Assumed Shares") under the Specified Target Plan.
The Assumed Shares shall thereafter be reserved for issuance under an
acquisition equity incentive plan of Parent (the "Parent Acquisition Equity
Incentive Plan"), which Parent will implement in connection with the Merger.
The Assumed Shares reserved for issuance shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of the Parent Acquisition Equity Incentive Plan.

5.12 _Spreadsheet_. The Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent, at or
prior to the Closing, a spreadsheet in a form to be supplied by Parent to the
Company, which spreadsheet shall be dated as of the Closing Date and 



 

53  shall set forth, as of the Closing Date and immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (i) the names of all holders of Company Options, Company RSUs
and Unvested Company Shares, their respective addresses and where available,
taxpayer identification numbers, and whether they are then providing services
to the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to Company Options and Company RSUs, and/or the number
of Unvested Company Shares held by such Persons, (iii) the exercise price per
share in effect for each Company Option and each Company RSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (iv) the vesting status and schedule with respect to
each Company Option, each Company RSU and each Unvested Company Share held by
each holder thereof (including the vesting commencement date and repurchase
price payable per share with respect to any Unvested Company Share), (v) the
Tax status of each Company Option under Section 422 of the Code, and (vi) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Company
Options or upon vesting of the Company RSUs to be assumed by Parent and the
per share exercise price thereof (such spreadsheet the "Spreadsheet"). A draft
of the Spreadsheet shall be provided by the Company to Parent not later than
two Business Days prior to the proposed date of the Closing. 

5.13 _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date
on which the Merger becomes effective, Parent will assume, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects, the obligations
of the Company to its directors and officers as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") pursuant to any indemnification
agreements with the Company and any indemnification or advancement provisions
under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the
Agreement Date with respect to their acts and omissions as directors and
officers of the Company occurring prior to the Effective Time, in each case,
subject to applicable Legal Requirements. From and after the Effective Time,
such obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to advancement,
exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the Agreement Date, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years
from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of the Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required
by Legal Requirements.

(b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Merger becomes effective, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in
effect, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in
effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties with respect to their acts
and omissions as directors and officers of the Company occurring prior to the
Effective Time, the existing policy of directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company as of the Agreement Date in the form made
available by the Company to Parent prior to the Agreement Date (the "Existing
DandO Policy"), to the extent that directors and officers liability insurance
coverage is commercially available; _provided_ , _however_ __, that: (i) the
Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing DandO Policy a policy or
policies of comparable coverage, including a "tail" insurance policy; and (ii)
the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums for
the Existing DandO Policy (or for any substitute or "tail" policies) in excess
of an amount equal to 300% of the most recently paid annual premium for the
Existing DandO Policy (the "Maximum Premium"). In the event any future annual
premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute policies) exceed the
Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the
amount of coverage of the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute or "tail"
policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal
to the Maximum Premium.

(c) This Section 5.13 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is
intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties, shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, shall be
enforceable by each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, and may not be amended, altered or repealed after the
Effective Time without the prior written consent of the affected Indemnified
Party (provided that any amendment, alteration or repeal prior the Effective
Time shall be governed by Section 7.4).



 

54 5.14 _Termination of Benefit Plans_. The Company shall take such actions in
furtherance of freezing or terminating Company Employee Plan(s) as Parent may
reasonably require. In the event that actions taken with respect to Company
Employee Plans would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges,
surrender charges or other fees then the Company shall take such actions as
are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees
and provide such estimate in writing to Parent no later than ten Business Days
prior to the Closing Date.

5.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Provided that the Company delivers to Parent the
Section 16 Information (as defined below) in a timely fashion, Parent and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted
under applicable Legal Requirements) to cause any disposition of Company
Capital Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Capital Stock) or acquisition of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by Article I of this Agreement by each Company
Insider to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
"Section 16 Information" shall mean information regarding the Company
Insiders, the number of shares of Company Capital Stock held by each such
Company Insider and expected to be exchanged for cash in connection with the
Merger, and the number and description of the Company Options and Company RSUs
held by each such Company Insider and expected to be converted into options to
purchase Parent Common Stock and restricted stock units for Parent Common
Stock, in connection with the Merger. "Company Insiders" shall mean those
individuals who are subject to the reporting requirement of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company. 

5.16 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company and the Company Board shall (i) take all
actions necessary to ensure that no takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) if any takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or any transactions
contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

5.17  _Certificates_. The Company shall prior to the Closing Date deliver (i)
FIRPTA documentation, including (A) a notice to the Internal Revenue Service,
in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
1.897-2(h)(2), in the form reasonably requested by Parent, dated as of the
Closing Date and executed by the Company, together with written authorization
for Parent to deliver such notice form to the Internal Revenue Service on
behalf of the Company after the Effective Time, and (B) a FIRPTA Notification
Letter, in the form reasonably requested by Parent, dated as of the Closing
Date and executed by the Company; and (ii) a certificate dated within three
Business Days of the Closing from the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware certifying that the Company is in good standing.

5.18  _Director and Officer Resignations_. At the request of Parent, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a written letter
of resignation from each of the directors and officers of the Company and from
each of the directors and officers of each Subsidiary that will be effective
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

date of such termination; (y) for a termination described in clause (iii)
above, prior to or concurrently with such termination; or (z) for a
termination described in clause (iv) above, the date of the consummation of
such Acquisition.



 

59 (c) In the event that either of Parent or the Company terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d) and the Termination Fee is not
thereupon payable, then within one Business Day following Parents submission
of reasonable documentation of such fees and expenses, the Company shall
reimburse Parent for all of Parents fees and expenses not in excess of $5
million in connection with the evaluation and pursuit of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Parent. The amount of any fees and expenses
reimbursed by the Company to Parent shall be credited against any subsequent
payment by the Company to Parent of the Termination Fee pursuant to Section
7.3(b).

(d) The Company acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in Sections
7.3(b) and 7.3(c) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) the amount of, and the basis for payment of, the fees and
expenses described therein is reasonable and appropriate in all respects, and
(iii) without this agreement, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the fees and
expenses due pursuant to Sections 7.3(b) and/or 7.3(c), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment for the
amounts set forth in Sections 7.3(b) and/or 7.3(c), the Company shall pay to
Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amount set forth in Sections 7.3(b) and/or 7.3(c) at the prime rate of
Bank of America, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made hereunder. Payment of the fees described in Sections 7.3(b) shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its Affiliates in
connection with any termination of this Agreement in the circumstances in
which such fees became payable. In the event that Parent shall receive the
Termination Fee, the receipt of such fee shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent or
any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the termination
hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof)
or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of Parent or
any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim,
action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out
of this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters
forming the basis for such termination. All payments under this Section 7.3
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Parents
account set forth on _Schedule 7.3(c)_ or such other account as shall be
specified by Parent prior to any termination of this Agreement.

(e) For the purposes of this Agreement, an "Acquisition" shall mean any of the
following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately
preceding such transaction hold less than 60% of the aggregate equity
interests in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or any
direct or indirect parent thereto, (ii) a sale or other disposition by the
Company or its Subsidiaries of assets (in a transaction or series of
transactions) representing in excess of 40% of the aggregate fair market
value of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
such sale, or (iii) the acquisition by any Person or Group (including by way
of a tender offer or an exchange offer or issuance by the Company), directly
or indirectly, of beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial
ownership of shares representing in excess of 40% of the voting power of the
then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion,
whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under more than one
provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events.

7.4 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained; provided, after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment shall be made which by
law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of NASDAQ requires
further approval by such stockholders without such further stockholder
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by execution of an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Sub and the
Company.



 

60 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time any party
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, except that Parent may not extend for the benefit of Sub and vice
versa, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto,
and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the
benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party
hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The agreement of Parent
to any extension or waiver shall be deemed to be the agreement of Sub to such
extension or waiver. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall
not constitute a waiver of or estoppel with respect to, such right.

8.3 _Interpretation_.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections
or Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an
Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Except in the case of
_Schedule 7.3(c)_ , when a reference is made to a Schedule, such reference
shall be to a Schedule to the Company Disclosure Letter. Where a reference is
made to a Legal Requirement, such reference is to such Legal Requirement as
amended. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

(b) The words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be
deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
phrases "provided to," "furnished to," and phrases of similar import when used
herein, unless the context otherwise requires, shall mean that a correct and
complete paper copy of the information or material referred to has been
delivered to the party to whom such information or material is to be provided.
Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires: (i) words of any
gender include each other gender; (ii) words using the singular or plural
number also include the plural or singular number, respectively; and (iii) the
terms "hereof," "herein," "hereunder" and derivative or similar words refer
to this entire Agreement.

(c) The one percent (1.0%) threshold established by the parties with respect
to the Companys capitalization in Section 6.3(a) hereof shall not, in and of
itself, constitute an economic benchmark for determining whether any Effect
shall be deemed to be material in relation to the Company and its business or
shall be deemed to constitute a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

8.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being
understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart.

8.5 _Entire Agreement; Parties in Interest_. This Agreement and the documents
and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, including all the exhibits attached hereto, and
the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, except for the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, and
shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in accordance with its terms,
and (ii) are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as
conferring, upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 5.13.
For the avoidance of doubt, Section 5.10 shall be construed as a statement of
general intent only.

8.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such
assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except
that Parent may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent without the prior consent of the Company; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that Parent 



 

62  shall remain liable for all of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

8.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

8.8 _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereto
shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party hereto of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party of
any right to specific performance or injunctive relief. The parties hereto
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement, without any requirement to post a bond or other
security, and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

8.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware. The
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that
court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington,
Delaware, in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions
of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and hereby waive,
and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for
the interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject
thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by
such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with
respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such
courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction
over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute
and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 8.2 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, shall be valid
and sufficient service thereof.

8.10 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, hereby waive, with respect to this Agreement and each Exhibit
attached hereto, the application of any Legal Requirement, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
shall be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

8.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
