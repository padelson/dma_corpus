**ARTICLE  III**

 

**Consideration;  Exchange Procedure**

 

 

_3.01_ _Conversion  or Cancellation of Shares_

 

 

(a) _Company  Common Stock_.  At the  Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part  of  any shareholder, each share
of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than Exception Shares, shall  be  converted into and
constitute the right to receive:

 

 

(1) at  the  election of the holder thereof as provided in, and subject to
the provisions  of  Section 3.01(c)  and  Section 3.08, either:

 

 

(A) a  number  of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient,
rounded to the nearest  thousandth, obtained by dividing the Initial Per
Share Purchase Consideration  by  the Closing Parent Share Price (the "
_Initial_ _Per  Share Stock Consideration_ ");  or 

 

 

(B) cash  in  an amount equal to the Initial Per Share Purchase
Consideration (the " _Initial  Per Share Cash Consideration_ "),  and 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(2) the  contingent right to receive additional amounts from the Escrow Fund
as provided  in the Escrow Agreement.

 

 

Each  share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the  Effective Time, other than Exception Shares, is hereinafter defined
as an " _Old  Share_." Old  Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
canceled and retired and shall  cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (an " _Old  Certificate_ ")  formerly representing Old Shares
shall thereafter cease to have any rights  with  respect to such shares,
except the right to receive, as applicable, without  interest, upon exchange
of such Old Certificate in accordance with this  Article III (i) any
dividends with respect to Company Common Stock  with a record date prior to
the Effective Time but unpaid as of the Effective  Time and (ii) the
consideration to which he or she may be entitled pursuant  to this Article
III.

 

 

(b) _Determination  of Initial Purchase Consideration._

 

 

(1) The  Initial Purchase Consideration shall equal (i) the Estimated
Purchase Price  minus (ii) the Escrow Amount (the "Initial Purchase
Consideration"). Not later  than five business days prior to the Closing
Date, Company will deliver to  Parent an estimated balance sheet of Company
as of the close of business on  the  Closing Date (the "Estimated Balance
Sheet"), including a statement setting  forth its best estimate of
Stockholders' Equity ("Estimated Equity") as of the  Closing Date and a
detailed calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price (taken  together, the
"Estimated Purchase Price Statement"). The Company shall deliver  to Parent
on the day prior to the Closing Date its updated Estimated Equity  determined
as of the close of business two days prior to the Closing Date.  The 
Estimated Purchase Price Statement will be prepared using the updated
Estimated  Equity and applying GAAP, as modified by the definition of
Stockholders' Equity  contained herein, and, to the extent consistent with
GAAP, on the basis of  the  same accounting principles and practices used by
Company in the preparation  of  Company Financial Statements delivered prior
to the date of this  Agreement.

 

 

(2) On  the  day prior to the Closing Date the Company and Parent shall in
good faith agree  in writing to the amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount. 

 

 

(c) _Election  Procedures_.

 

 

(1) An  election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal
materials in  such  form as Parent and Company shall mutually agree (the "
_Election  Form_ ")  shall  be mailed on the date on which proxy materials
relating to the Merger are mailed  to holders of shares of Company Common
Stock or such other date as Parent and  Company shall mutually agree (the "
_Mailing  Date_ ")  to  each holder of record of Company Common Stock as of
the close of business on  the  same date as the record date for eligibility
to vote on the Merger (the " _Election  Form Record Date_ ").

 

 

(2) Each  Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through  appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to
specify  (A) the number of shares of such holder's Company Common Stock with
respect  to which such holder elects to receive the Initial Per Share Stock
Consideration  (" _Stock  Election Shares_ "),  (B) the number of shares of
such holder's Company Common Stock with respect  to which such holder elects
to receive the Initial Per Share Cash Consideration  (" _Cash  Election
Shares_ ")  or  (C) that such holder makes no election with respect to such
holder's  Company Common Stock (" _No  Election Shares_ ").  Any  Company
Common Stock with respect to

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

which  the  Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed
Election Form  on or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard time, on the first
business day  subsequent to the Company Meeting (or such other time and date
as Parent and  Company may mutually agree) (the " _Election  Deadline_ ") 
shall  also be deemed to be No Election Shares.

 

 

(3) Parent  shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested  from time to time by any person who becomes a holder (or
beneficial owner)  of  Company Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of  business on the business day prior to the Election
Deadline, and Company shall  provide to the Exchange Agent all information
reasonably necessary for it to  perform as specified herein.

 

 

(4) Any  such  election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have  actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline.  An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only
if accompanied by  one  or more Old Certificates (or customary affidavits
and indemnification regarding  the loss or destruction of such certificates
or the guaranteed delivery of  such  certificates) representing all shares
of Company Common Stock covered by such  Election Form, together with duly
executed transmittal materials included in  the  Election Form. Any Election
Form may be revoked or changed by the person  submitting such Election Form
only by written notice received by the Exchange  Agent prior to the Election
Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and  signed revised Election
Form. In the event an Election Form is revoked prior  to  the Election
Deadline, unless a subsequent properly completed Election Form  is 
submitted and actually received by the Exchange Agent by the Election
Deadline,  the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Election
Form shall  become No Election Shares and Parent shall cause the Old
Certificates to be  promptly returned without charge to the person submitting
the Election Form  upon  written request to that effect from the holder who
submitted the Election Form.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of
the Election Form, the Exchange  Agent shall have reasonable discretion to
determine whether any election,  revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard  immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and
any good faith decisions of Parent  regarding such matters shall be binding
and conclusive. Neither Parent nor  the  Exchange Agent shall be under any
obligation to notify any person of any defect  in an Election Form.

 

 

(5) Within  five business days after the later to occur of the Election
Deadline or the  Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to
effect the allocation  among the holders of Company Common Stock of rights to
receive Parent Common  Stock or cash in the Merger in accordance with the
Election Forms as  follows:

 

 

(A) _Cash  Oversubscribed_.  If the  aggregate cash amount that would
otherwise be paid upon the conversion in the  Merger of the Cash Election
Shares is greater than the Maximum Cash  Consideration, then:

 

 

(I) all  Stock  Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to  receive the Initial Per Share Stock Consideration,

 

 

(II) the  Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election
Shares, by a  pro  rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares to
receive the Initial  Per  Share Stock Consideration (" _Stock  Designated
Shares_ ")  such  that the aggregate of cash that will be paid in the

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Merger  equals an amount as close as practicable but in no event greater than
the  Maximum Cash Consideration, and all Stock Designated Shares shall be
converted  into the right to receive the Initial Per Share Stock
Consideration,  and

 

 

(III) the  Cash  Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will
be converted into  the  right to receive the Initial Per Share Cash
Consideration.

 

 

(B) _Cash  Undersubscribed_.  If the  aggregate cash amount that would be
paid upon conversion in the Merger of the  Cash Election Shares is less than
the Minimum Cash Consideration,  then:

 

 

(I) all  Cash  Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the Initial Per  Share Cash Consideration,

 

 

(II) the  Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No Election
Shares, by  a  random selection process, and then (if necessary) from among
the Stock Election  Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient
number of shares to  receive the Initial Per Share Cash Consideration ("
_Cash  Designated Shares_ ")  such  that the aggregate cash amount that
will be paid in the Merger equals as closely  as practicable but in no event
less than the Minimum Cash Consideration, and  all  Cash Designated Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Initial  Per Share Cash
Consideration, and

 

 

(III) the  Stock  Election Shares and the No Election shares that are not
Cash Designated Shares  shall be converted into the right to receive the
Initial Per Share Stock  Consideration.

 

 

(C) _Cash  Subscriptions Sufficient_.  If the  aggregate cash amount that
would be paid upon conversion in the Merger of the  Cash Election Shares is
equal to or exceeds the Minimum Cash Consideration  and  does not exceed the
Maximum Cash Consideration (as determined by the Exchange  Agent), then
subparagraphs (A) and (B) above shall not apply and all Cash  Election Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive the Initial Per  Share Cash
Consideration and all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares  shall be
converted into the right to receive the Initial Per Share Stock 
Consideration.

 

 

The  pro  rata selection process to be used by the Exchange Agent shall
consist of such  equitable pro ration processes as shall be mutually
determined by Parent and  Company. In addition, the Parent and the
shareholders of the Company who have  executed the Voting Agreements may
agree that a specified number of Stock  Designated Shares or Cash Designated
Shares, as applicable, may be selected  from  among the shares subject to
the Voting Agreements prior to the pro rata  selection process, after which
the pro rata selection process will occur, if  necessary.

 

 

For  purposes of the calculations in this Section 3.01(c), but not for any
pro rata  selection process, Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be Cash
Election  Shares.

 

 

(d) _Exception  Shares_.  At the  Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part  of  any shareholder, each Exception
Share shall cease to be  outstanding,

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

shall  be  canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be  delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(e) _No  Fractional Shares_.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates  nor  scrip for fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued in the  Merger. Each holder who otherwise would
have been entitled to a fraction of  a  share of Parent Common Stock shall
receive in lieu thereof cash (without  interest) in an amount determined by
multiplying the fractional share interest  to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled (after taking into account  all  shares of Company
Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time)  by  the Closing
Parent Share Price. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends,  voting
rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional  share.

 

 

_3.02_ _Exchange  of Old Certificates; Payment of the Consideration_ _._

 

 

(a) _Appointment  of Exchange Agent_.  Until  the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available on  a  timely basis or cause to
be made available to an exchange agent agreed upon  by  Parent and Company
(the " _Exchange  Agent_ ")  (1) cash in an amount sufficient to allow the
Exchange Agent to make all  payments that may be required pursuant to this
Article III and  (2) certificates representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock  (" _New  Certificates_ "),  each  to be given to the holders of
Company Common Stock in exchange for Old  Certificates pursuant to this
Article III. Upon such anniversary, any such  cash or New Certificates
remaining in the possession of the Exchange Agent  (together with any
earnings in respect thereof) shall be delivered to Parent.  Any holder of Old
Certificates who has not theretofore exchanged his or her  Old  Certificates
pursuant to this Article III shall thereafter be entitled to  look
exclusively to Parent, and only as a general creditor thereof, for the 
consideration to which he or she may be entitled upon exchange of such Old 
Certificates pursuant to this Article III. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any
holder  of  Old Certificates for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant  to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

 

(b) _Exchange  Procedures_.  Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no
event later than five business  days  thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each  person who was, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, a holder of record  of  Company Common Stock and who
theretofore has not submitted such holder's Old  Certificates with an
Election Form, a form of letter of transmittal (which  shall  specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Old  Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to  the  Exchange
Agent) containing instructions for use in effecting the surrender  of  Old
Certificates in exchange for the consideration to which such person may  be 
entitled pursuant to this Article III. After completion of the allocation 
procedure set forth in Section 3.01(c)  and upon  surrender to the Exchange
Agent of an Old Certificate for cancellation together  with such letter of
transmittal or Election Form, as the case may be, duly  executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder  of such
Old Certificate shall promptly be provided in exchange therefor, but  in  no
event later than ten business days after due surrender, a New  Certificate
and/or a check in the amount to which such holder is entitled  pursuant to
this Article III, and the Old Certificate so surrendered shall  forthwith be
canceled. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from  the  Merger
consideration such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold  under 
the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision  of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld  by Parent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this  Agreement as having been paid to Company shareholders in
respect to which such  deduction and withholding

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

was  made  by Parent. No interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any
property  to be  delivered upon surrender of Old Certificates.

 

 

(c) _Transfer  to Holder other than Existing Holder_.  If any  cash payment
is to be made in a name other than that in which the Old  Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a  condition of
such exchange that the person requesting such exchange shall pay  any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the making of such payment 
of  the Initial Per Share Cash Consideration in a name other than that of
the  registered holder of the Old Certificate surrendered, or required for
any other  reason relating to such holder or requesting person, or shall
establish to  the  reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or  is  not payable. If any New Certificate representing
shares of Parent Common Stock  is to be issued in the name of other than the
registered holder of the Old  Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor,
it shall be a condition of the  issuance thereof that the Old Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly  endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise  in proper form for transfer, and that
the person requesting such exchange shall  pay to the Exchange Agent in
advance any transfer or other taxes required by  reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of Parent Common  Stock in a name other than
that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate  surrendered, or
required for any other reason relating to such holder or  requesting person,
or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the  Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

 

(d) _Dividends_.  No  dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time  with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid
to the holder of any  unsurrendered Old Certificate until the holder thereof
shall surrender such  Old  Certificate in accordance with this Article III.
After the surrender of an  Old Certificate in accordance with this Article
III, the record holder  thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions,  without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect  to shares of Parent Common Stock
represented by the New  Certificate.

 

 

(e) _Transfers_.  At or  after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer  books of Parent of Old Shares.

 

 

(f) _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_.  If any  Old Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making  of an  affidavit

3.04 _Dissenting  Shareholders._

 

 

(a) Except  as  otherwise provided herein, each Dissenting Share shall _not_
  be  converted into or represent a right to receive the Initial Per Share
Purchase  Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled
only to such  rights as are granted by Section 23-1-44-8 of the IBCL. Company
shall give  Parent prompt notice upon receipt by Company of any demand for
payment pursuant  to Sections 23-1-44-8 and 23-1-44-9 of the IBCL and of
withdrawals of such  notice and any other instruments provided pursuant to
applicable law (any  shareholder duly making such demand being hereinafter
called a " _Dissenting  Shareholder_ "),  and  Parent shall have the right
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings  with respect to any such
demands. Company shall not, without the prior written  consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, settle, offer to settle  or  otherwise
negotiate any such demands. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting 
Shares shall be made by Parent.

 

 

(b) If  any  Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure  to  perfect or otherwise) his or her right to dissent
under Section  23-1-44-8 of  the  IBCL at or prior to the Effective Time,
each of such holder's shares of Company  Common Stock shall be converted into

accordance with the applicable provisions of this  Agreement.

 

 

_3.05_ _Effect  on Parent and Merger Sub Stock_ _. _

 

 

(a) Each  share of Parent  Stock  issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time will remain  outstanding.

 

 

(b) Each  share of Merger  Sub common stock  issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain  outstanding.

 

 

_3.06_ _Escrow_.  On the  Closing Date, Parent, the Escrow Agent and the
Shareholders' Agent shall execute  the Escrow Agreement. By 9:00 a.m. Eastern
Standard time on the day immediately  following the Closing Date, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be  deposited, with the Escrow Agent, for
the benefit and on behalf of the  shareholders of Company an amount of cash
equal to the Escrow Amount (the "Escrow Fund") for disbursement in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow  Agreement. The Escrow Fund constitutes part of
the consideration to be paid  to  the holders of Company Common Stock,
receipt of which is subject to the terms  and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement

 

 

_3.07_ _Determination  of Final Purchase Price Adjustment_ _. _ The 
Initial Purchase Consideration shall be subject to adjustment following the 
Closing Date as follows:

 

 

(a) As  soon  as practicable after the Closing, but in no event later than
60 days after  the  Closing Date, Parent will prepare (or cause to be
prepared) and deliver to  the  Shareholders' Agent a balance sheet of
Company as of the close of business on  the Closing Date, a statement setting
forth the actual Stockholders' Equity as  of such date and a statement
setting forth a detailed calculation of the  Purchase Price and Final
Purchase Price Adjustment (taken together the " _Proposed  Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement_ ").  The  Proposed Purchase Price Adjustment Statement
will be prepared applying GAAP,  as  modified by the definition of
Stockholders' Equity contained herein, and, to the  extent consistent with
GAAP, on the basis of the same accounting principles  and  practices used by
Company in the preparation of Company Financial Statements  delivered prior
to the date of this Agreement.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(b) The  Shareholders' Agent shall have 15 days from receipt of the Proposed
Purchase  Price Adjustment Statement to give Parent written notice of his or
her objection  to any item or calculation contained in the Proposed Purchase
Price Adjustment  Statement, specifying in reasonable detail all disputed
items and the basis  therefore (a " _Purchase  Price Dispute Notice_ "). 
If  the Shareholders' Agent concurs with the Proposed Purchase Price
Adjustment  Statement or otherwise does not give Parent a Purchase Price
Dispute Notice  within such 15-day period, such Proposed Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement  shall be deemed final and conclusive with respect to
the determination of the  Final Purchase Price Adjustment and shall be
binding on the parties for all  purposes under this Agreement. If, however,
the Shareholders' Agent delivers a  Purchase Price Dispute Notice objecting
to any items or calculations contained  in the Proposed Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement within such 15-day period,  Parent and the Shareholders'
Agent shall meet within 15 days following the date  of the Purchase Price
Dispute Notice (the " _Resolution  Period_ ")  and  shall attempt in good
faith to resolve such objections and any written  resolution by them as to
any disputed amount shall be deemed final and  conclusive with respect to the
determination of the Final Purchase Price  Adjustment and shall be binding on
the parties for all purposes under this  Agreement. Any amounts that were not
timely disputed pursuant to a Purchase  Price Dispute Notice (or if so
disputed, subsequently resolved) may not be  disputed. In all events the
Proposed Purchase Price Adjustment Statement shall  be final and binding,
except to the extent of those amounts timely identified  in  a Purchase
Price Dispute Notice in accordance with this paragraph.

 

 

(c) If  Parent  and the Shareholders' Agent are unable to resolve the
Shareholders' Agent's  objections within the Resolution Period, then Parent
shall designate and retain  the Independent Accountant, subject to the
written approval of Company, which  approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Following such approval  by Company, Parent and the
Shareholders' Agent shall submit for review by the  Independent Accountant
all amounts and issues remaining in dispute and Parent's  and the
Shareholders' Agent responses thereto. All parties agree to execute, if 
requested by the Independent Accountant, a reasonable engagement letter with 
respect to the determination to be made by the Independent Accountant. The 
Independent Accountant will determine only those issues still in dispute at 
the  end of the Resolution Period and the Independent Accountant's
determination will  be based upon and consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.  The determination by the Independent
Accountant will be based solely on the  information contained in the
presentations with respect to such disputed items  by Parent and the
Shareholders' Agent to the Independent Accountant and not on  the Independent
Accountant's independent review. Each of Parent and the  Shareholders' Agent
will use its reasonable best efforts to provide its  presentations and
related information as promptly as practicable following  submission to the
Independent Accountant of the disputed items, and each such  party will be
entitled, as part of its presentation, to respond to the  presentation of the
other party and any questions and requests of the  Independent Accountant.
Discovery shall be limited to documents designated  by  the Independent
Accountant as necessary for it to assess the proper calculation  of the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment consistent with this Agreement. The  Independent
Accountant's determination will be made within 30 days after its  engagement
(which engagement will be made no later than five business days  after  the
end of the Resolution Period), or as soon thereafter as possible, and will 
be set forth in a written statement delivered to the Shareholders' Agent and 
Parent. The Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement as finalized by the 
Independent Accountant shall be deemed final and conclusive with respect to 
the  Final Purchase Price Adjustment and shall be binding on Parent and the 
shareholders of Company for all purposes under this Agreement. In deciding 
any  matter, the Independent Accountant (A) will be bound by the provisions
of this  Agreement and (B) may not assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest  value for such item claimed by either Parent or the
Shareholders' Agent or less  than the smallest value for such

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

item  claimed by Parent or the Shareholders' Agent. The fees and expenses of
the  Independent Accountant in resolving all such objections shall be borne
by  (1) Parent in an amount equal to the proportion of the total disputed 
amount that the Independent Accountant finds in favor of the Shareholders'
Agent  and (2) the Shareholders' Agent in an amount equal to the proportion
of the  total disputed amount that the Independent Accountant finds in favor
of Parent.  The amount of the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant
to be paid  by  the Shareholders' Agent will be assessed first against the
Escrow Fund. Except  as provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs
and expenses incurred  by  the parties in connection with resolving any
dispute hereunder before the  Independent Accountant will be borne by the
party incurring such cost and  expense. The term " _Final  Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement_ " will  mean the definitive Proposed Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement agreed to  by  the Shareholders' Agent and Parent or
resulting from the determination made by  the Independent Accountant in
accordance with this Section 3.07(c).

 

 

(d) In  the  event that the Purchase Price set forth on the Final Purchase
Price Adjustment  Statement exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price set forth on
the Estimated  Purchase Price Statement (such excess, together with interest
thereon at an  annual rate of five percent (5.00%) from the Closing Date to
the date of  payment, the " _Purchase  Price Increase_ "),  then  Parent
shall promptly deliver to the Escrow Agent an amount in cash so that  the 
sum of such cash and the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be
equal  to the Purchase Price Increase. The Escrow Agent will promptly
distribute an  amount equal to the Purchase Price Increase from the Escrow
Account to the  former holders of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of  the  Escrow Agreement. In the event that the Estimated
Purchase Price set forth  on  the Estimated Purchase Price Statement exceeds
the Purchase Price set forth  on  the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement (such excess, together with  interest thereon at an annual rate of
five percent (5.00%) from the Closing  Date  to the date of payment, the "
_Purchase  Price Decrease_ "),  then  the Escrow Agent shall promptly
disburse to Parent from the Escrow Account  an  amount equal to such
Purchase Price Decrease, but in no event an amount greater  than the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Amount. Any remaining Escrow Funds  in  excess of
the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be distributed to the former holders  of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow 
Agreement.

 

 

_3.08_ _Payment  Options_ _._

 

 

(a) In  the  event that the Closing Parent Share Price without regard to the
Lower Threshold  is less than $25.663, Parent shall elect to pay to the
holders of Stock Election  Shares and Stock Designated Shares (if
applicable), for each Stock Election  Share and Stock Designated Share (if
applicable), either (i) in addition to  the  Initial Per Share Stock
Consideration cash in an amount equal to the difference  between $25.663 and
the Closing Parent Share Price without regard to the Lower  Threshold, (ii) a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to a quotient,  rounded to the
nearest thousandth, obtained by dividing the Initial Per Share  Purchase
Consideration by the Closing Parent Share Price without regard to  the 
Lower Threshold, or (iii) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to 
a  quotient, rounded to the nearest thousandth, obtained by dividing the
Initial  Per Share Purchase Consideration by a figure between the Closing
Parent Share  Price without regard to the Lower Threshold and $25.663 (the "
_Assumed  Closing Parent Share Price_ "),  plus  cash equal to the
difference between $25.663 and the Assumed Closing Parent  Share Price;
_provided,_   that if  any such election by Parent other than pursuant to
3.08(a)(ii) would cause  the  condition of Section 7.01(f) to not be
satisfied, then Parent shall offer the  consideration set forth in Section
3.08(b).

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding  anything else to the contrary contained herein, in the
event that the Closing  Parent Share Price is less than the Lower Threshold
and Parent pursuant to  Section 3.08(a) must offer the consideration set
forth in this Section 3.08(b),  then Parent shall pay to all holders of Old
Certificates in cash in an amount  for each Old Certificate equal to the
Initial Per Share Cash consideration,  regardless of any elections made
pursuant to Article III ("All Cash Payment  Option").

 

 

(c) If  the  All Cash Payment Option is utilized, then Parent shall cause
payment to be  made  to all holders of Old Certificates within the later to
occur of (i) thirty  (30)  days following the Closing Date, which payment
shall include interest thereon  at  an annual rate of five percent (5.00%)
from the Closing Date to the date of  payment, or (ii) within ten business
days after satisfaction of the conditions  of Section 3.02(b) with respect to
the surrender by the holder of the Old  Certificate to the Exchange Agent the
Old Certificate for cancellation together  with such letter of transmittal or
Election Form, as the case may be, duly  executed and completed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, which  payment shall include interest thereon
at an annual rate of five percent (5.00%)  from the Closing Date to the date
thirty (30) days subsequent to the Closing  Date.

maintained by any of  them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which

deficiency" (whether or not waived)  within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA  and none of its ERISA Affiliates has an
outstanding funding waiver. Neither  it  nor any of its Subsidiaries has
provided, or is required to provide, security  to  any of its Pension Plans
or to any single-employer plan of any of its ERISA  Affiliates pursuant to
Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

 

 

(5) Neither  it nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for post-
retirement health,  life, or any other welfare or fringe benefits under any

Subsidiaries may amend or  terminate any such retiree health, life, or fringe
benefit plan at any time  without incurring any liability thereunder other
than in respect of claims  incurred prior to such amendment or termination.

paid under  section 409A(a)(1) of the Code by reason of a Benefit Arrangement
failing to  comply with Section 409A of the Code and any regulations or
regulatory guidance  issued thereunder.

 

 

(8) No  oral  or written representation or communication with respect to any
aspect of a  Benefit Arrangement has been made to any employee on or before
the Closing  Date  that is not in accordance with the written or otherwise
preexisting terms and  provisions of such Benefit Arrangements.

 

 

(9) All  Benefit Arrangements that are subject to the continuation coverage
requirements  as set forth in Section 1001 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget

(10) There  has  been no amendment to, written interpretation or
announcement (whether or not  written) by it or its Subsidiaries relating to
Employee participation, coverage  or benefits under any Benefit Arrangement

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(v) _Tax  Treatment of Merger_.  Neither  Parent nor Company has any

(b) Parent  and Company each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that
none of the  information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or

the Registration  Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective  under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or  omit to state any material fact required to be stated

material fact, or to omit to state any material fact  necessary to make the
statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly  inform the other
party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the  Registration

order or the suspension  of  the qualification of Parent Common Stock for

proceeding for any such  purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the

other written shareholder communication with  respect to the Merger or this
Agreement and will not issue any such  communication or make any such public

unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,  that  a party may, without the
prior consent of the other party (but after prior  consultation, to the
extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such  communication or make
such public statement as may be required by applicable  law  or securities
exchange rules. Parent and Company will cooperate to develop  all  public
communications and make appropriate members of management available  at 
presentations related to the transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably 
requested by the other party.

 

 

_6.06_ _Access;  Information_ _._

 

 

(a) Each  of Parent  and  Company agrees that upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable laws  relating to the exchange of information, it will
(and will cause its  Subsidiaries to) afford the other party, and the other
party's officers,  employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
Representatives, such  access during normal business hours throughout the
period before the Effective  Time to the books, records (including Tax
Returns and work papers of independent  auditors), properties, personnel and
to such other information as the other  party may reasonably request and,
during such period, it will furnish promptly  to the other party (1) a copy
of each report, schedule and other document  filed by it pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities or  banking laws, and (2) all
other information concerning the business,  properties and personnel of it as
the other may reasonably request. Neither  Parent  nor  Company will be
required to afford access or disclose information that would  jeopardize
attorney-client privilege, contravene any binding agreement with  any  third
party, or violate any law or regulation. The parties will make appropriate 
substitute arrangements in circumstances where the previous sentence 
applies.

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

34  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(b) Each  party will hold any information which is nonpublic and confidential
to the  extent required by, and in accordance with, the Confidentiality
Agreement  between Parent and Company (the " _Confidentiality  Agreement_
").

 

 

(c) No  investigation by Parent or Company of the business and affairs of the
other  party, pursuant to this Section 6.06  or  otherwise, will affect or
be deemed to modify or waive any representation,  warranty, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to any  party's obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated  hereby.

 

 

(d) Each  party hereby acknowledges that it is aware, and that it will advise
its  directors, officers, employees, and agents who are informed as to the
matters  which are the subject of this Agreement, that the United States
securities  laws  prohibit any person who has received from an issuer or its
affiliates material,  non-public information from purchasing or selling
securities of such issuer  or  from communicating such information to any
other person.

 

 

_6.07_ _Acquisition  Proposals_.  Company  will not, and will cause its
Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries' officers,  directors, agents, advisors and
affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage  or knowingly facilitate
inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engage in  any  negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information  or  data
to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any Acquisition 
Proposal, except as otherwise provided herein. Nothing contained in this
Section  6.07 will prohibit Company from engaging in discussions with respect
to any  unsolicited Acquisition Proposals if, in the good faith judgment of
the Board  of  Directors based upon the written advice of counsel to
Company, failure to engage  in such discussions would be a breach of its
fiduciary duties or any other  obligations under applicable law. Company will
immediately cease and cause  to be  terminated any activities, discussions
or negotiations conducted before the  date  of this Agreement with any
persons other than Parent  with  respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
will use its reasonable best efforts  to  enforce any confidentiality or
similar agreement relating to an Acquisition  Proposal. Company will promptly
(within one business day) advise Parent  following  receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof, and will keep  Parent 
apprised  of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a
current  basis.

 

 

_6.08_ _Affiliate  Agreements_.  Not  later than the 15th day before the
date of mailing of the Proxy Statement,  Company will deliver to Parent a
schedule of each person that, to the best  of  its knowledge, is or is
reasonably likely to be, as of the date of the Company  Meeting, deemed to be
an "affiliate" of Company (each, a "Company  Affiliate") as that term is used
in Rule 145 under the Securities Act.  Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each person who may be  deemed to be a Company Affiliate to
execute and deliver to Parent and Company  on  or before the date of mailing
of the Proxy Statement an agreement in  substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B.

 

 

_6.09_ _Takeover  Laws and Provisions_.  Neither  party will take any
action that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby  to be subject
to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them  will  take all
necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued 
exemption of) those transactions from, or if necessary challenge the
validity  or  applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or
hereafter in effect.  Neither party will take any action that would cause the
transactions  contemplated hereby not to comply with any Takeover Provisions
and each of  them  will take all necessary steps within its control to make
those transactions  comply with (or continue to comply with) the Takeover
Provisions.

respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use all  reasonable best efforts
to prepare as promptly as possible all documentation,  to  effect all
filings and to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and  authorizations of
all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary  to  consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, (the "Requisite Regulatory  Approvals") as
promptly as practicable, and will make all necessary filings in  respect of
those Requisite Regulatory Approvals as soon as practicable;  provided, that
Parent shall not be required to consummate the transactions  contemplated
hereby if, in the reasonable good faith judgment of Parent, any  conditions
or restrictions imposed in connection with any such Requisite  Regulatory
Approval may reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability  of
Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or operate any 
business operated by Parent, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries 
following the Effective Time in substantially the same manner it has been 
operated prior to the date of this Agreement (a "Burdensome Condition").
Parent  and Company will, upon request, furnish the other party with all
information  concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and  such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection  with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party  or any of its Subsidiaries with or to any third
party or Governmental Authority  in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Effective Time,  the Surviving Corporation shall and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation  to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present
and former directors and  officers of Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an
" _Indemnified  Party_ "),  against costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments,  fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
as incurred, in connection with  any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative,
arising out of actions or omissions occurring  at or before the Effective
Time (including the transactions contemplated  hereby), to the same extent as
such persons are indemnified or have the right  to  advancement of expenses
pursuant to the Constituent Documents and  indemnification agreements, if
any, in effect on the date of this Agreement  with  Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 

 

(b) Prior  to  the Effective Date, Company will obtain tail coverage, in
addition to its  existing director and officer liability insurance coverage,
to provide  director's and officer's liability insurance through the sixth
anniversary of  the Effective Date that serves to reimburse the present and
former officers  and  directors of Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (determined as  of  the Effective Time) (as opposed to Company
or such Subsidiary) with respect  to  claims against such directors and
officers arising from facts or events  occurring before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated  hereby), which insurance will
contain at least the same coverage and amounts,  and contain terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party  as that coverage
currently provided by Company; _provided_ ,  that  officers and directors of
Company or any Subsidiary may be required to make  application and provide
customary representations and warranties to Company's  insurance carrier for
the purpose of obtaining such insurance.

 

 

(c) Any  Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under  Section
6.12(a),  upon  learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described  above, will promptly notify Parent; _provided_ , 
that  failure so to notify will not affect the obligations of Parent under 
Section 6.12(a)  unless  and to the extent that Parent is actually
prejudiced as a  consequence.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

(d) If  Parent  or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other  entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity
of such consolidation  or  merger or transfers all or substantially all of
its assets to any other entity,  then and in each case, Parent will cause
proper provision to be made so that  the  successors and assigns of Parent
will assume the obligations set forth in this  Section 6.12.

 

 

(e) The  provisions of this Section 6.12  shall  survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will  be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and  Representatives.

 


 

(f) Parent  shall be entitled to recover from, and be reimbursed out of, the
Escrow Account  in an amount up to the Indemnity Escrow Amount for any and
all losses,  liabilities (including any liabilities under Section 6.12(a)
which are not  otherwise covered by insurance (collectively, the "DandO
Claims"), claims,  expenses (including costs of investigation and defense and
reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses), or damages of any
kind or nature  whatsoever, whether or not involving a third party claim
(collectively, the  "Damages") imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against
Parent or any of its  subsidiaries (including but not limited to the
Surviving Corporation),  directors, officers, employees, or other agents or
representatives, or any  of  their respective successors or assigns
(collectively "Parent Indemnitees"),  resulting from, arising out of or based
upon (X) any claim or action (whether  pending or threatened) of a type
Previously Disclosed against the Company,  or  (Y) any claim or action
relating to Dissenting Shares (DandO Claims, (X) and  (Y) collectively, the
"Claims") or (Z) any breach of any representation,  warranty or covenant of
Company (collectively, a "Breach"); provided, however,  that any claim by
Parent for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.12(f)  relating to any
Claims must be made by providing notice thereof to the  Shareholders Agent
and the Escrow Agent on or before September 18, 2012,  and any  claim by
Parent for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.12(f) relating  to 
any Breach must be made on or before the date the Escrow Agent releases the 
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow in accordance with Section 3.07(d) above. 
The  amount of any Claim with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be
equal  to the  difference between the amount per Dissenting Share paid
pursuant to Section  3.04  of this Agreement and the Initial Per Share Cash
Consideration, as adjusted  for  any Purchase Price Increase or Purchase
Price Decrease. If at any time prior  to  September 18, 2012 Company or
Parent receives a full release of all Parent  Indemnitees in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, with regard to any  Claims  made or threatened prior
to that date, the Escrow Agent shall release to  the  former shareholders of
the Company entitled to receive payments from the  Escrow  Account pursuant
to Section 3.01(a)(2) any amount remaining in the Escrow  Account
attributable to the Indemnity Escrow Amount after full payment to  Parent 
of any amounts to which it is entitled under this Section 6.12(f). If
Company  or  Parent does not receive such a release, then the Escrow Agent
may not release  any amount until the date which is thirty (30) days from the
date on which  any  Claim is dismissed with prejudice, or determined by
judge or jury and such  dismissal or determination has become a final and
non-appealable judgment.  If  Parent has not notified the Escrow Agent and
the Shareholders Agent of any  Claim  prior to September 18, 2012, the
Escrow Agent shall release to the former  shareholders of the Company
entitled to receive payments from the Escrow  Account  pursuant to Section
3.01(a)(2) any amount remaining in the Escrow Account  attributable to the
Indemnity Escrow Amount after full payment to Parent  of any  amounts to
which it is entitled under this Section 6.12(f). The amounts to  be 
released pursuant to this Section 6.12(f) shall be set forth in a
spreadsheet,  or other form of written notice, provided jointly by Parent and
the  Shareholders' Agent to the Escrow Agent and authorizing the payment of
such  specified amounts to Shareholders.

(g) Pursuant  to Section 3.07(d) of this Agreement, in the event that the
Estimated Purchase  Price set forth on the Estimated Purchase Price Statement
exceeds the Purchase  Price set forth on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement, then Parent  and the Shareholders' Agent shall execute and deliver
a joint written direction  to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to
(i) distribute to Parent  an amount equal to such Purchase Price Decrease,
but in no event shall Parent  be  entitled to recover an amount greater than
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow  Amount, and (ii) distribute any
remaining Escrow Funds in excess of the  Indemnity Escrow Amount to the
former holders of Company Common Stock in  accordance with the provisions of
the Escrow Agreement. Upon receipt of such  joint written direction, the
Escrow Agent shall make the distributions to such  accounts as Parent and
Shareholders shall have designated to the Escrow Agent  in  writing.

 

 

(h) Pursuant  to Section 3.07(d) of this Agreement, in the event that the
Purchase Price  set  forth on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement
exceeds the Estimated  Purchase Price set forth on the Estimated Purchase
Price Statement, then Parent  and the Shareholders' Agent shall execute and
deliver a joint written direction  to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow
Agent to (i) accept from Parent  the deposit of an amount of cash equal to
the Purchase Price Increase, and  (ii) distribute to the Shareholders all
Escrow Funds other than the amount  of the Escrow Indemnity Amount, including
such additional deposited cash. Upon  receipt of such joint written
direction, the Escrow Agent shall make the  distributions to such accounts as
Shareholders shall have designated to the  Escrow Agent in writing.

 

 

_6.13_ _Employee  Matters_ _. _

 

 

(a) As  soon  as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide
the employees  as  of the Effective Time of Company and its Subsidiaries
(the " _Covered  Employees_ ")  with  employee benefits and compensation
plans, programs and arrangements (including  base salary, annual bonus
opportunities and annual equity grants) that are  substantially similar to
those provided to similarly situated employees of  Parent and its
Subsidiaries (without regard to grandfathered benefits provided  to limited
groups of employees of Parent). In addition, subject to the terms  and 
conditions of _Schedule  A_   hereto,  after the Effective Date, a Covered
Employee whose employment is terminated  due  to Merger-related elimination
of the Covered Employee's position and who  executes a valid waiver and
release in a form acceptable to Parent (and who  does  not revoke such
waiver and release during any applicable revocation period),  shall be
entitled to receive severance payments and benefits in accordance  with 
_Schedule  A_.

 

 

(b) Parent  shall (1) provide all Covered Employees with service credit for
purposes of  eligibility (including eligibility for retirement),
participation, vesting,  levels of benefits and benefit accruals, under any
employee benefit or  compensation plan, program or arrangement adopted,
maintained or contributed  to  by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which
Covered Employees are eligible  to  participate, for all periods of
employment with Company or any of its  Subsidiaries (or their predecessor
entities) prior to the Effective Time to  the  extent credited by Company
for purposes of a comparable plan (provided that  there will be no
duplication of benefits) and (2) cause any pre-existing  conditions,
limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical  examinations
under any welfare benefit plans of Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries to be
waived with respect to the Covered Employees and their  eligible dependents,
to the extent waived under the corresponding plan (for  a  comparable level
of coverage) in which the applicable Covered Employee  participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) After  the  date of this Agreement: (i) Company shall, except as
otherwise provided in  Section 6.13(d), continue to sponsor, maintain and
administer its 401(k) plan  (the

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

"401(k)  Plan") and employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") in accordance with
its terms  and conditions as set forth in its plan and trust documents as of
the date  of  this Agreement, and in accordance with applicable law; (ii)
Parent shall  continue to sponsor and maintain the 1st Source Corporation
Employee Stock  Ownership and Profit Sharing Plan (the "Parent Plan") in
accordance with terms  and conditions of the Parent Plan as set forth in its
plan and trust documents  as of the date of this Agreement and any amendments
thereto, and in accordance  with applicable law; (iii) the Company shall fund
all unpaid employee  contributions accrued through the Closing Date and owed
to the 401(k) Plan,  as  well as any discretionary employer contributions to
the 401(k) Plan or ESOP  (with respect to compensation earned by participants
through the Closing Date)  determined by the Company before the Closing Date
(and disclosed to Parent)  in  amounts not in excess of the discretionary
employer contributions previously  made by the Company and its affiliates to
the 401(k) Plan and ESOP; (iv) Parent  shall fund all unpaid employee
contributions accrued through the Closing Date  and owed to the Parent Plan,
as well as any discretionary employer contributions  (with respect to
compensation earned by participants through the Closing Date)  determined by
Parent before the Closing Date in amounts not in excess of the  discretionary
employer contributions previously made by Parent to the Parent  Plan; (v) the
Company shall amend the 401(k) Plan and ESOP (after Parent has  been given
the opportunity to review and comment on each such amendment), to  the 
extent not amended by the Closing Date, as may be necessary to maintain the 
tax-qualification of the 401(k) Plan and ESOP and their related employee
benefit  trusts for favorable income tax treatment under Sections 401(a) and
501(a)  of  the Code, respectively, and to implement the amendments referred
to in  subsection (d) of this Section 6.13; (vi) Parent shall amend the
Parent Plan  (after the Company has been given the opportunity to review and
comment on  each  such amendment), to the extent not amended by the Closing
Date, as may be  necessary to maintain the tax-qualification of the Parent
Plan and its related  employee benefit trust for favorable income tax
treatment under Sections 401(a)  and 501(a) of the Code, respectively; (vii)
Company shall do whatever the Parent  and Company determine is necessary to
correct any failures in the administration  of the 401(k) Plan and ESOP that
could affect the tax qualification of the  401(k) Plan and ESOP prior to the
Closing Date, including a filing under the  Internal Revenue Service's
Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System or the  Department of Labor's
Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program; (viii) Company  shall pay any excise
taxes due if it is determined that a prohibited transaction  has occurred in
the 401(k) Plan or ESOP; and (ix) after the Closing, Parent  shall either
terminate the ESOP or merge it into Parent Plan at a time and  in  the
manner determined by the Parent.

 

 

(d) Immediately  prior to the Closing, the Company Board shall adopt
resolutions (which may  include appropriate amendments to the 401(k) Plan,
including the full vesting  of  all 401(k) Plan participants upon
termination) that terminate the 401(k) Plan  effective immediately prior to
the Closing. If any of the individual fiduciaries  responsible for
administering the 401(k) Plan resign from that position upon or  after the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall appoint another individual  to that
position (in the manner provided in the 401(k) Plan). Promptly after  the 
Closing, Parent shall or shall cause Surviving Corporation to notify the
401(k)  Plan participants and beneficiaries of the name, address and
telephone number  of  each of the fiduciaries of the 401(k) Plan to whom
questions about benefits  due  under the 401(k) Plan may be directed after
the Closing. Parent also shall,  or  cause Surviving Corporation to, file or
cause to be filed an application with  the IRS for a favorable determination
letter to the 401(k) Plan. Following  receipt of such letter and the final
liquidation of assets under the 401(k)  Plan, such assets (net of any
liabilities) shall be (i) distributed to each  participant in accordance with
the applicable distribution provisions of the  401(k) Plan, (ii) if directed
by a participant, directly rolled over to an  individual retirement

rollover  to the Parent Plan; _provided,  however_ ,  that  the Parent
Plan will not be obligated to accept any such rollover contributions  prior
to the receipt of such favorable determination letter. Parent shall,  or 
cause Subsidiary Corporation to, timely file or cause to be filed an annual 
return (IRS Form 5500) for the 401(k) Plan for each plan year ending on or 
after  the Closing Date for which such a return is required to be filed.

 

 

_6.14_ _Notification  of Certain Matters_.  Parent and  Company will give
prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance  known to it
that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together  with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any  Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it, (b) would cause or constitute a  material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or  agreements
contained herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, 
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in  Article
VII or (c) could reasonably be expected to result in a change to  the
investment securities portfolio policies, procedures, practices, 
characteristics or composition of Company or its Subsidiaries.

Parent shall consult with respect to their loan, litigation and real estate 
valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels 
of  reserves) and Company shall make such modifications or changes to its
policies  and practices, if any, and at such date prior to the Effective
Time, as may  be  mutually agreed upon. Company and Parent shall also
consult with respect to  the  character, amount and timing of restructuring
charges to be taken by each of  them in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and Company shall  take such charges in accordance with
GAAP, as may be mutually agreed upon.  No  party's representations,
warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement  shall be deemed to be
untrue or breached in any respect for any purpose as  a  consequence of any
modifications or changes to such policies and practices  which  may be
undertaken on account of this Section 6.15.

reasonably efforts to terminate the agreements  identified in Section 6.16

commercially reasonably efforts to sell in arms-length  transactions at
commercially reasonable prices and other commercially reasonable  terms the

on or prior to the Closing Date, subject to the  approval of Parent, which
approval shall not be unreasonably  withheld.

 

 

_6.18_ _Shareholders '  Agent_ _. _

 

 

(a) Company  has designated Wayne B. Welter as the initial " _Shareholders
'  Agent_"  hereunder, and approval of this Agreement (including the plan of
merger  contained herein) by the requisite vote of the holders of Company
Common Stock  shall constitute ratification and approval of the designation
of the  Shareholders' Agent as their true and lawful attorney-in-fact, for
them in their  name and on their behalf, (i) to give and accept notice in
accordance with  this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or other agreement
or document entered  into in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and  the  Escrow Agreement, whether prior to, on or after the
Effective Time, (ii) to  execute the Escrow Agreement and any other agreement
or document entered into  in  connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Escrow  Agreement, whether prior to, on or after
the Effective Time, (iii) to waive  any  provisions of any such agreements,
(iv) to authorize delivery to Parent of  any  funds from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, (v) to  settle disputes between the
parties and (vi) to perform the other duties  required of the Shareholders'
Agent under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement  and any other agreement or
document to which

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

the  Shareholders' Agent is a party. This power of attorney shall not be
terminated  or otherwise affected by the disability of any holder of Company
Common Stock.  This power of attorney shall terminate only when the duties of
the Shareholders' Agent have been fully performed or upon resignation as
provided below. From  and  after the Effective Time, Parent  and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to conclusively rely as to  any 
obligation they may have hereunder to the former holders of Company Common 
Stock  upon any written instruction, waiver, notice, request, demand or
other  communication delivered by or on behalf of the shareholders of Company
by the  Shareholders' Agent.

 

 

(b) In  the event of the resignation, death or incapacity of any
Shareholders' Agent, a  new Shareholders'  Agent shall  be appointed by a
three (3) person committee consisting of Donna D. Welter,  Wendy N. Meyers,
and Cyril J. Welter (the  " _Shareholders '  Committee_").  In the event
that any individual authorized hereunder as a Shareholders' Committee member
shall die, become incapacitated, resign or otherwise fail  to  act on behalf
of the Shareholders for any reason, a new individual shall be  appointed to
the committee by action or written consent of persons who held  immediately
prior to the Effective Time no less than a majority of the  outstanding
Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) (the " _Majority  Holders_
"),  and if none is so selected within thirty (30) days, then the
Shareholders' Committee shall be reduced by one member. The vote of the
majority of the  members of the Shareholders' Committee members shall
constitute the act of the  Shareholders' Committee. Upon formation, the
Shareholders' Committee shall  designate one member as the notice recipient
and furnish such member's contact  information to Parent. Thereafter, in each
case under this Agreement whereby  Parent is required to notify, contact or
otherwise provide information or  documents to the Shareholders'  Agent, if
there is no person currently serving as a Shareholders' Agent, such 
requirement shall be satisfied by Parent's notification, contact or provision
of  information or documents to the designated Shareholders' Committee
member.  Notwithstanding the formation of the Shareholders' Committee,
nothing in this  Section 6.18(b)  shall allow any extension or delay in the
period of time that the Shareholders'  Agent is  required to respond or
otherwise act as set forth in this Agreement or the  Escrow Agreement.

 

 

(c) The  Shareholders' Agent shall have such powers and authority as are
necessary to  carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement;
_provided,  however,_   that the  Shareholders' Agent will have no
obligation to act on behalf of the holders of  Company Common Stock, except
as expressly provided herein. The Shareholders' Agent will have no liability
to Parent, Merger Sub, Company, the Surviving  Corporation or the holders of
Company Common Stock with respect to actions  taken  or omitted to be taken
in its capacity as Shareholders' Agent, except with  respect to the
Shareholders' Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Parent shall
not be liable in any way to the shareholders of Company or Company  based on
any act or omission of the Shareholders' Agent relating to this  Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement. The Shareholders' Agent will at all times be  entitled
to rely on any directions received from the Majority Holders;  _provided, 
however,_   that the  Shareholders' Agent shall not be required to seek or
follow any such direction,  and shall be under no obligation to take any
action in its capacity as  Shareholders' Agent, unless the Shareholders'
Agent is holding funds delivered  to it under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement and/or has been provided  with  other funds, security or
indemnities which, in the sole determination of the  Shareholders' Agent, are
sufficient to protect the Shareholders' Agent against  the losses which may
be incurred by the Shareholders' Agent in responding to  such direction or
taking such action. The Shareholders' Agent shall be entitled  to engage such
counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as it shall  deem necessary
in connection with exercising its powers and performing its  function
hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the  Shareholders'
Agent) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and  advice of
such persons. Any expenses

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

incurred  by the Shareholders' Agent with respect to the foregoing shall be
reimbursed out  of the Escrow Fund, or if such fund has been depleted, and
notwithstanding  any  provision hereof to the contrary, at the instruction
of the Shareholders' Agent  out of and prior to any distributions to be made
to the holders of Company  Common Stock (other than holders of Dissenting
Shares) pursuant to this  Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, or such other
mechanism established by the  Shareholders' Agent for the benefit of the
holders of Company Common Stock  (other than holders of Dissenting Shares)
for such purpose, and in no event  shall the Shareholders' Agent be entitled
to any other reimbursement for any  expenses from the Escrow Fund.

 

 

_6.19_ _Current  Public Information_.  Parent  agrees that it shall, for a
period of three (3) years following the Effective  Time, use its best efforts
to meet the current public information requirements  as set forth in
paragraph (c) of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities  Act,  and will
provide those persons providing affiliate letters pursuant to this  Agreement
with such other information as they may reasonably require and to  otherwise
cooperate with such persons to facilitate any sales of Parent Common  Stock
issued to such persons pursuant to this Agreement in compliance with  the 
provisions of Rule 144 and/or Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities  Act.

 

 

_6.20_ _Parent  Stock_.  Parent  and Company each agrees that it shall not,
and shall cause its directors,  officers, subsidiaries and affiliates to not,
directly or indirectly, take  any  action that is intended to manipulate the
Closing Parent Share  Price.

may be abandoned, at any time before  the Effective Time:

 

 

(a) _Mutual  Agreement_.  By  mutual agreement of the parties in writing.

 

 

(b) _Breach_.  By  Parent or Company, upon 60 days' prior written notice of
termination, if  there has occurred and is continuing: (1) a breach by the
other party of  any representation or warranty contained herein; or (2) a
breach by the  other party of any of the covenants or agreements in this
Agreement;  _provided_ ,  that  such breach (under either clause (1) or
(2)) would entitle the non-breaching  party not to consummate the Merger
under Article VII.

 

 

(c) _Delay_.  By  Parent or Company, if the Effective Time has not occurred
by the close of  business on August 31, 2007 (the " _Termination  Date_
");  _provided_ ,  that  the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.01(c)  shall  not be available to any party whose failure to
comply with any provision of  this  Agreement has been the cause of, or
materially contributed to, the failure  of  the Effective Time to occur on
or before such date; _provided,  further_ ,  that  the Termination Date
will be tolled for any period of time during which the  Merger is enjoined by
way of a temporary restraining order, injunction or  otherwise.

 

 

(d) _Denial  of Regulatory Approval_.  By  Parent or Company, if the
approval of any Governmental Authority required for  consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby is  denied by final,
nonappealable action of such Governmental Authority;  _provided_ ,  that 
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.01(d) shall not 
be available to any party whose failure to comply with any provision of this 
Agreement has been the cause of, or materially contributed to, such  action.

 

 

(e) _Acceptance  of Acquisition Proposal by Company_.  By  Company, prior
to the approval of the Merger at the Company Meeting, in order  to 
concurrently enter into an agreement respecting an Acquisition Proposal that 
(i)  has been received by the Company Board in compliance with Section 6.07
hereof,  and (ii) the Company Board, based  upon the written advice of
counsel to Company and  after  consultation with its financial advisors and
taking  into account all legal, financial, tax, regulatory and other aspects
of the  proposal (including, without limitation, any break-up fees, expense 
reimbursement provisions, required financing and whether conditions to 
consummation are reasonably capable of being completed) has concluded in 
good  faith that  failure to terminate this Agreement and accept the
Acquisition Proposal would  be  a breach of the fiduciary duty of the
Company Board or any other obligation  under applicable law;  _provided, 
however,_ that  this  Agreement may be terminated by the Company pursuant to
this Section 8.01(e)  only after the fifteenth calendar day following the
Company's provision of  written notice to Parent advising Parent that the
Board of Directors is prepared  to accept an Acquisition Proposal and setting
forth the material terms and  conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal,
including the amount of  consideration per share of Company Common Stock the
stockholders of the Company  will receive (valuing any non-cash consideration
at what the Company Board  determines in good faith, after consultation with
its independent financial  advisor, to be the fair value of the non-cash
consideration) and only if (i)  during such fifteen-calendar day period, the
Company has caused its financial  and legal advisors to negotiate with Parent
in good faith to make such  adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that acceptance  of such Acquisition Proposal would no longer
be in the best interests of the 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Company,  and (ii)  the Company Board has considered such adjustments in the
terms and conditions  of  this Agreement resulting from such negotiations
and has concluded in good faith,  based upon consultation with its financial
and legal advisers, that failure  to  terminate this Agreement and accept
the Acquisition Proposal, even after giving  effect to the adjustments
proposed by Parent, would be a breach of the fiduciary  duties of the Company
Board or any other obligations under applicable laws;  and  _provided 
further_ that  such  termination shall not be effective until the Company
pays the Termination Fee  in  accordance with Section 8.02(b) hereof.

 

 

(f) _Acceptance  of Acquisition Proposal by Parent_.  By  Company if Parent
has entered into an agreement with respect to an Acquisition  Proposal which
would result in the acquisition of all Parent Common Stock by  a  person or
entity not an affiliate of Parent as of the date hereof.

 

 

_8.02_ _Effect  of Termination and Abandonment_ _. _

 

 

(a) _General  Provisions_.  If this  Agreement is terminated and the Merger
is abandoned, no party will have any  liability or further obligation under
this Agreement, except that termination  will not relieve a party from
liability for any breach by it of this Agreement  and except that the first
sentence of Section 5.03(q),  Section 6.06(b), this Section 8.02 and Article
IX will survive  termination of this Agreement. __

 

 

(b) _Termination  Fee to Parent_.  If the  Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(e), then the Company  shall pay Parent an
amount equal to $4,500,000 in immediately available funds  by  wire-transfer
to an account designated by Parent, on or prior to the earlier  of  the date
on which an agreement with respect to the Acquisition Proposal is  executed
and the date on which the Acquisition Proposal is consummated. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any 
payment of the fee pursuant to this Section 8.02(b) shall represent the sole 
remedy for any termination of this Agreement requiring such payment and the 
Company and its Subsidiaries shall have no further liability under this 
Agreement.

agreements made or undertaken by  Parent or Company in this Agreement are

_9.07_ _Entire  Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.  This 
Agreement represents the entire understanding of Parent  and  Company
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby and supersede any and all 
other oral or written agreements previously made or purported to be made,
other  than the Confidentiality Agreements. No representation, warranty,
inducement,  promise, understanding or condition not set forth in this
Agreement has been  made or relied on by any party in entering into this
Agreement. Except for  Section 6.12,  which  is intended to benefit the
Indemnified Parties to the extent stated, and the  provisions of the Escrow
Agreement, nothing expressed or implied in this  Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities  upon any person
other than Parent  and  Company.

 

 

_9.08_ _Severability_ __.  If  any  provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any person or  circumstance is determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,  void or unenforceable, the
remaining provisions, or the application of such  provision to persons or
circumstances other than those as to which it has been  held invalid or
unenforceable, will remain in full force and effect and will  in  no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated thereby, so long as the economic  or 
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in 
any  manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination, the
parties  will negotiate in good faith in an effort to _  agree upon a
suitable and equitable substitute provision to effect the original  intent of
the parties._

 

 

_9.09_ _Alternative  Structure_.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or the Confidentiality  Agreements, before the
Effective Time, Parent  may  revise the structure of the Merger or otherwise
revise the method of effecting  the Merger and related transactions,
provided, that (1) such revision does  not alter or change the kind or amount
of consideration to be delivered to  the  shareholders of Company, (2) such
revision does not adversely affect the  tax consequences to the shareholders
of Company; provided that, if Section  3.08(b) becomes applicable, clause (2)
of this Section 9.09 shall not be  applicable, (3) such revised structure or
method is reasonably capable of  consummation without significant delay in
relation to the structure contemplated  herein, and (4) such revision does
not otherwise cause any of the  conditions set forth in Article VII not to be
capable of being fulfilled  (unless duly waived by the party entitled to the
benefits thereof), other than  Section 7.01(f) if Section 3.08(b) becomes
applicable. This Agreement and any  related documents will be appropriately
amended in order to reflect any such  revised structure or method.
