PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated July 16, 2004, between The Black
and Decker Corporation, a Maryland corporation ("Buyer"), and Pentair, Inc., a
Minnesota corporation ("Parent").   R E C I T A L S   WHEREAS, Parent,
through the Subsidiaries, is engaged in the design, manufacture, marketing,
distribution and sale of portable power tools, stationary and benchtop
woodworking tools, tool accessories, pressure washers, air compressors and
generators (the "Business").   WHEREAS, Buyer desires to acquire, directly
or indirectly, from Parent and the Sellers (i) the U.S. Intellectual
Property, (ii) all of the outstanding shares of capital stock, membership
interests and other ownership interests (the "Equity Interests") held by
Parent and its Affiliates in each of the Transferred Subsidiaries, (iii) the
Canadian Assets, subject to the Canadian Liabilities, and (iv) the Toolz
Shares, and Parent desires to sell and transfer the U.S. Intellectual
Property, the Equity Interests, the Canadian Assets, subject to the Canadian
liabilities, and the Toolz Shares to Buyer and its Affiliates.   WHEREAS,
capitalized terms not defined in the context in the Section in which such
terms first appear shall have the meaning set forth in Section 11.17.   NOW
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions hereinafter
set forth, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:   1. PURCHASE AND SALE   1.1. Purchase and Sale.   Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Parent
shall sell and cause each of its Affiliates designated on Schedule 1.1 (each
a "Seller" and, collectively, the "Sellers") to sell to Buyer or those
of Buyer\'s Affiliates designated on Schedule 1.1 (each a "Purchaser"
and collectively, the "Purchasers"), and Buyer shall purchase or shall cause
its Affiliates to purchase from Parent and its Affiliates, the U.S.
Intellectual Property, the Equity Interests, the Canadian Assets, subject to
the Canadian Liabilities, and the Toolz Shares, as set forth on Schedule
1.1.   2. PURCHASE PRICE; PAYMENT   2.1. Purchase Price and Payment.  
The purchase price (the "Purchase Price") payable by Buyer and the Purchasers
to Parent and the Sellers in consideration for the transactions described
herein shall be in the amount of $775,000,000, subject to the following
adjustments:     (a) Increase. An increase equal to the amount, if any,
by which the Net Asset Value as reflected on the Estimated Closing Statement
is greater than the Agreed Base Equity; and   (b) Decrease. A decrease
equal to the amount, if any, by which the Net Asset Value as reflected on the
Estimated Closing Statement is less than the Agreed Base Equity.  Buyer
shall pay, or shall cause the Purchasers to pay, the Purchase Price payable
pursuant to this Section 2.1 on the Closing Date by one or more
wire transfers of immediately available funds to an account the Parent
has designated, at least (2) business days prior to the Closing Date, in
writing to Buyer.   2.2. Determination of Net Asset Value; Post-Closing
Adjustment.   (a) Estimated Closing Statement. For purposes of
determining an estimate of the Net Asset Value to be reflected on the Closing
Statement and the Purchase Price payable by Buyer at the Closing, not less
than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall, in
consultation with Buyer, prepare and deliver to Buyer a reasonable estimate
of the Closing Statement prepared in a manner consistent with the
requirements for the preparation of the Closing Statement. In the event Buyer
shall object to any of the information set forth in such estimate as
presented by Parent, the parties shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to
agree on appropriate adjustments so that such estimate reflects a reasonable
estimate of the Closing Statement and of the Net Asset Value to be reflected
on the Closing Statement, but in the absence of such agreement or manifest
error, the good faith determination of the estimate by Parent shall control
(the estimate as agreed to by the parties pursuant to this subsection, or in
the absence of such agreement or manifest error, the estimate as prepared and
delivered by Parent, is herein referred to as the "Estimated Closing
Statement"). In connection with the determination of the Estimated Closing
Statement, Parent shall provide to Buyer such information and detail as Buyer
shall reasonably request.   (b) Closing Statement. Within forty five (45)
days following the Closing, Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and deliver to Buyer an unaudited consolidated combined balance sheet of the
Subsidiaries (the "Closing Statement"), which shall set forth the Net Asset
Value as of the Closing Date and, except as set forth on Schedule 2.2(b),
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date of the
preparation of the Recent Balance Sheet applied on a basis consistent with
the accounting methods, policies, practices and principles used in the
preparation of the Recent Balance Sheet. The Closing Statement shall be
prepared based only on information relating to the content of the Closing
Statement that (i) is known to Buyer or Parent on the Closing Date or (ii)
becomes known by Buyer or Parent after the Closing Date if such information
relates to an event that occurred prior to the Closing Date. Within ten days
following the Closing, Parent shall conduct a physical count of the inventory
of the Subsidiaries which count may be observed by the Buyer\'s employees and
accountants. Such physical count of the inventory, adjusted for changes since
the Closing Date, shall be used in the preparation of the Closing
Statement.    2    (c) Disputes Regarding Closing Statement. Following
delivery of the Closing Statement to the Buyer, Parent shall, and shall cause
its employees and accountants who were involved in the preparation of the
Closing Statement to provide promptly to the Buyer and its employees and
accountants full access during normal business hours to the financial books
and records used in the preparation of the Closing Statements including all
working papers of Parent and its accountants. Buyer shall, within forty-five
(45) days after the delivery by Parent of the Closing Statement, complete its
review of the Net Asset Value derived from the Closing Statement. If Buyer
determines that the Closing Statement has not been prepared in accordance
with Section 2.2(b), then Buyer shall inform Parent on or before the last day
of such 45-day period by delivering a notice to Parent ("Buyer\'s Objection")
(i) setting forth a specific description of the basis of Buyer\'s Objection
and the adjustments to Net Asset Value that Buyer believes should be made and
(ii) only including objections based on mathematical errors or based on the
Closing Statement not being prepared in accordance with Section 2.2(b).
Parent shall then have thirty (30) days to review and respond to Buyer\'s
Objection. Parent and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing
any differences which they may have with respect to any matter specified in
Buyer\'s Objection and Parent shall have full access to the working papers of
Buyer prepared in connection with Buyer\'s preparation of Buyer\'s Objection.
If Parent and Buyer are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with
respect to the determination of the foregoing items within twenty (20) days
following Parent\'s response to Buyer\'s Objection, then Parent and Buyer
shall refer their remaining differences to an internationally recognized firm
of independent public accountants as to which Parent and Buyer mutually
agree, which may not be the firm performing the appraisal pursuant to Section
2.3 (the "CPA Firm"), who shall, acting as experts and not as arbitrators,
determine on the basis of the standards set forth in Section 2.2(b), and only
with respect to the remaining accounting-related differences so submitted by
Buyer to Parent (and not by independent review), whether and to what extent,
if any, Net Asset Value as derived from the Closing Statement requires
adjustment. In connection with the engagement of the CPA Firm, each of the
parties shall execute reasonable engagement letters with the CPA Firm. Parent
and Buyer shall direct the CPA Firm to use its reasonable best efforts
to render its determination within forty-five (45) days. The CPA
Firm\'s determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Parent.
The fees and disbursements of the CPA Firm shall be shared equally by Buyer
and Parent. Buyer and Parent shall make readily available to the CPA Firm all
relevant books and records and any work papers (including those of the
parties\' respective accountants) relating to the Recent Balance Sheet and
the Closing Statement and all other items reasonably requested by the CPA
Firm. The "Final Closing Statement" shall be (i) the Closing Statement in the
event that (x) no Buyer\'s Objection is delivered to Parent during the 30-day
period specified above, or (y) Parent and Buyer so agree, (ii) the Closing
Statement, adjusted in accordance with Buyer\'s Objection in the event that
Parent does not respond to Buyer\'s Objection within the 30-day period
following receipt by Parent of Buyer\'s Objection, or (iii) the Closing
Statement, as adjusted by either (x) the agreement of Parent and Buyer or (y)
the CPA Firm.   (d) Cooperation. Buyer agrees that, following the Closing,
it will not take any actions with respect to the accounting books,
records, policies and procedures of the Subsidiaries that would obstruct or
prevent the preparation of the Closing Statement. Buyer shall cooperate with
Parent in the preparation of the Closing Statement including, but not limited
to, (i) providing Parent and Parent\'s representatives with full access
during normal business hours to the books, records (including work papers,
schedules, memoranda and other documents), facilities and employees of the
Subsidiaries, (ii) causing employees of the Subsidiaries to provide  
3   Parent as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date (but in no
event later than thirty (30) days after the Closing Date) with normal year-
end closing financial information for the Subsidiaries for the period ending
as of the close of business on the Closing Date, and (iii) cooperating fully
with Parent\'s representatives, including the provision on a timely basis of
all other information necessary or useful in connection with the preparation
of the Closing Statement. Buyer and its accountants shall have full access to
all information used by Parent in preparing the Closing Statement, including
the work papers of its accountants.   (e) Adjustment Payment to Buyer. In
the event the Net Asset Value as derived from the Final Closing Statement is
less than the Net Asset Value as reflected on the Estimated Closing
Statement, Parent shall make an adjustment payment to Buyer in an amount
equal to the difference between (i) the Net Asset Value as reflected on the
Estimated Closing Statement and (ii) the Net Asset Value as derived from the
Final Closing Statement. Any payment required by the first sentence of this
Section 2.2(e) shall be made by Parent to Buyer, together with interest
thereon at an annual rate equal to the U.S. prime interest rate of lending as
set forth in The Wall Street Journal as of the Closing Date (the "Applicable
Rate") calculated on the basis of the number of days elapsed from and
including the Closing Date to and excluding the date of payment, in
immediately available funds within five (5) business days after
the determination of the Final Closing Statement.   (f) Adjustment Payment
to Parent. In the event the Net Asset Value as derived from the Final Closing
Statement is greater than the Net Asset Value as reflected on the Estimated
Closing Statement, Buyer shall make an adjustment payment to Parent in an
amount equal to the difference between (i) the Net Asset Value as reflected
on the Estimated Closing Statement and (ii) the Net Asset Value as derived
from the Final Closing Statement. Any payment required by the first sentence
of this Section 2.2(f) shall be made by Buyer to Parent, together with
interest thereon at the Applicable Rate calculated on the basis of the number
of days elapsed from and including the Closing Date to and excluding the date
of payment, in immediately available funds within five (5) business days
after the determination of the Final Closing Statement.   2.3.
Allocation.   The Purchase Price, as finally determined, shall be allocated
among the various Equity Interests, the assets of the Subsidiaries that are
U.S. entities and subject to the election described in Section 5.1(e), the
U.S. Intellectual Property, the Canadian Assets and the Toolz Shares in
accordance with an appraisal performed by either (i) the appraisal division
of PricewaterhouseCoopers, (ii) the appraisal division of KPMG, or (iii)
the American Appraisal Company, as selected by the Buyer. The appraisal will
be performed in accordance with the standards of the American Society
of Appraisers. Within a reasonable period of time before such appraisals
are finalized, Buyer shall provide Parent a draft copy of such appraisals and
Buyer shall in good faith consider any comments made by Parent with respect
thereto. Parent, the Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall (i) be bound
by such allocation for purposes of determining any Taxes, (ii) prepare and
file all Tax Returns to be filed with any Taxing Authority in a manner
consistent with such allocation and (iii) take no position inconsistent with
such allocation in any Tax Return, any proceeding before any taxing authority
or otherwise. Appropriate adjustments shall be made to such allocation and to
specific categories of assets   4   within such allocation to reflect
any Purchase Price adjustment pursuant to Section 2.2. In the event that such
allocation is disputed by any Taxing Authority, the party receiving notice of
such dispute shall promptly notify the other party of such dispute, and
Parent and the Buyer shall cooperate in good faith in responding to such
challenge in order to preserve the effectiveness of such allocation.    3.

delivery or performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the Closing

Subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other valid rights to
use all Intellectual Property Rights and (ii) the conduct of the Business as
now being conducted does not conflict with any valid patents, trademarks,

Subsidiaries have been made available to the Buyer prior to the Closing and
accurately reflect all minutes of proceedings of and material actions taken
by the directors of the Subsidiaries or any committee of the Boards of
Directors of the Subsidiaries and all records of meetings of and actions
taken by the shareholders of the Subsidiaries.   (x) Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting.   (i) Since December 31, 2003, there has been no change
in the Subsidiaries\' internal control over financial reporting that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the

reporting results in the identification of any material weaknesses or
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Subsidiaries\' ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information, their process for the documentation of their internal control
over financial reporting is sufficient to permit the Subsidiaries to take
appropriate remedial action to correct such material weaknesses or
significant deficiencies by December 31, 2004.   3.2. Representations and

with, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a    14   default) under, or will result
in the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, any term or
provision of the charter or bylaws of Buyer or of the express terms of any
Contract to which Buyer is a party or by which Buyer or any of its assets or

described in Section 7.1 duly executed by an officer of the Buyer), and the
right to make a claim hereunder with respect thereto, shall survive the

the Subsidiaries or the business of the Subsidiaries or any other matter.
Except as expressly set forth herein, Buyer further agrees that none of
Parent, the Sellers or any other person or entity will have or be subject to
any liability to Buyer or any other person resulting from the distribution to
Buyer, or Buyer\'s use, of any such information, including the Confidential
Memorandum prepared by Parent and Goldman, Sachs and Co. dated March 2004 and
any information, document or material made    15   available or
provided to Buyer in certain management presentations or any other form in
expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Without

Buyer has received from or on behalf of Parent certain projections,
including, without limitation, projected statements of operating revenues and
income from operations of the Subsidiaries for the fiscal years ending
December 31, 2004 through December 31, 2008 and certain business

acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar
with such uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making
its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections
and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and

person acting on behalf of Parent with respect thereto. Accordingly, none of
Parent, the Sellers or any person acting on their behalf makes any

the reasonable opinion of Parent\'s legal counsel, may result in a violation
of any Law applicable to Parent or the Subsidiaries and (d) for information
that Parent reasonably believes is competitively sensitive, Parent agrees to
cause the Subsidiaries, during the period commencing on the date hereof and
ending on the Closing Date, to furnish or cause to be furnished to Buyer and
its representatives, at reasonable times and, upon reasonable notice, (i)

Buyer may from time to time reasonably request with due regard to
minimizing disruption of the business of the Subsidiaries; (ii) such access
to the books and records of Parent and the Subsidiaries relating to the
Subsidiaries as Buyer may from time to time reasonably request; and (iii)
such access to financial and operating data and other information with

independent auditors (with the consent of such auditors, which Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain), as Buyer may from time to
time reasonably request. During such period, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Subsidiaries to, allow Buyer and Buyer\'s accountants full access to the
Subsidiaries\' internal control over financial reporting documentation and
any corrective actions or other procedures conducted with respect to their

financial    16   reporting; provided, however, that nothing in this

reporting prior to the Closing. Buyer shall be solely responsible for the
costs, whether or not the Closing takes place in accordance herewith, that
Parent or the Subsidiaries may incur as the result of their compliance with
such recommendations of Buyer or its accountants over the costs that they
would otherwise incur in complying with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2004. Further, during such period, upon reasonable advance notice to and
with the prior consent of Parent in each instance (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), Buyer and its representatives shall be entitled to
such access to the officers and key employees of the Subsidiaries as Buyer
may reasonably request. Buyer agrees that it will treat all information
obtained from Parent or the Subsidiaries or otherwise obtained in its due
diligence investigation of the Subsidiaries as "Evaluation Material" under
the letter agreement entered into between Buyer and Parent dated February 18,
2004 (the "Letter Agreement") and will continue to honor its obligations
thereunder.   4.2. Conduct of Business Pending the Closing.   From the
date hereof until the Closing, except as required or contemplated by this
Agreement and except for any actions taken by the Subsidiaries consented to
by Buyer, the Parent shall cause each of the following to occur and
shall promptly notify the Buyer upon Parent\'s knowledge of the failure of
any of the following to occur:   (a) The Subsidiaries will operate the
business of the Subsidiaries only in the usual, regular and ordinary manner,
on a basis consistent with past practice;   (b) The Subsidiaries shall not
adopt or amend in any material respect any Subsidiary Benefit Plan and shall
not grant any increase in the compensation, salaries or wages payable to
employees of the Subsidiaries, except for reasonable increases in the

of contractual arrangements or sales compensation plans existing on the date
hereof, or as otherwise necessary to implement the provisions of Section 5.3,
or as otherwise required by applicable Laws;   (c) The Subsidiaries shall
not issue or authorize the issuance of, or agree to issue or sell any shares
of their capital stock of any class;   (d) The Subsidiaries shall not sell,
lease, license or otherwise transfer or dispose of any material properties or
assets of the Subsidiaries, or any of the Intellectual Property Rights,
except for the sale of assets in the ordinary course of business;   (e) The
Subsidiaries shall not initiate or settle any lawsuit or claim if such
lawsuit or settlement imposes a material continuing non-monetary obligation
on the Business other than the recognition of the intellectual property
rights of another party; and   (f) The Subsidiaries shall maintain in effect
all insurance policies in effect on the date hereof or replace such policies
with policies providing comparable coverage and issued by insurers of
comparable ratings so long as such insurance policies are reasonably
available on comparable terms in the insurance market generally.   17   
4.3. Further Actions.   Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, Parent
and Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, and to cooperate fully with
each other with respect to, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using all reasonable best efforts: (a) to obtain prior
to the Closing Date all licenses and permits that may be required to enable
the Buyer and its Affiliates, including the Subsidiaries and the Purchaser of
the Canadian Assets, to operate the Business after the Closing Date in the
same manner as it was operated prior to the Closing Date, (b) to obtain prior
to the Closing Date all consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications
and orders of Government Entities (subject to Section 4.4) and parties to
Contracts with the Subsidiaries that are necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and (c) to effect all necessary
registrations and filings (subject to Section 4.4); provided, however, that
such assistance shall not include any requirement of Parent, the Buyer or the
Subsidiaries to expend money, commence any litigation or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any other party.   4.4. Best
Efforts.   Buyer and Parent shall each make or cause to be made, as promptly
as practicable, (a) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby (which filing shall be made in any event within ten (10) business days
following the date hereof) and (b) all other necessary filings with other
Government Entities under other applicable Competition Laws relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and, in each case, Buyer and Parent shall
bear the costs and expenses of their respective filings; provided, however,
that Buyer shall pay any filing fees in connection therewith. Buyer and
Parent shall use their respective best efforts to respond at the earliest
practicable date to any requests for additional information made by the
Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice or any
other Government Entities, to use their commercially reasonable best efforts
to persuade such authorities to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act
and any other applicable Competition Laws to terminate or expire at the
earliest possible date, including by advocating at each of their respective
cost and expense, that the transactions contemplated hereby do not constitute
a violation of the Competition Laws so as to attempt to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the date
specified in Section 10.1(b)), all to the end of expediting consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer and Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to facilitate the expiration of any
applicable waiting period under any Competition Law, to secure
the termination of any investigation by any Governmental Entity under
any Competition Law, to avoid the filing of any suit or proceeding under
any Competition Law by any Governmental Entity seeking to enjoin the
transactions contemplated herein or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other Order in
any suit or proceeding under any Competition Law that would otherwise have
the effect of restraining, preventing or delaying the consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein. The commercially reasonable best efforts
required of a party by this Section 4.4 shall be determined by that party in
its sole and absolute discretion and shall not be subject to challenge,
judicial or otherwise. Each of Buyer and Parent shall promptly inform the
other of any material communication from any Governmental Entity regarding
any of the transactions contemplated   18   hereby and shall permit the
other to review in advance any proposed communication to any Governmental
Entity. Each of Buyer and Parent shall consult with the other prior to any
meetings, by telephone or in person, with the staff of the Federal Trade
Commission, the United States Department of Justice or any other Government
Entities, and each of Buyer and Parent shall have the right to have a
representative present at any such meeting unless antitrust counsel to the
party having such meetings, after consultation with antitrust counsel to
the other party, recommends against the presence of the other party at such
meeting.   4.5. Notification.   (a) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall
promptly notify Buyer (after Parent has notice thereof) and Buyer shall
promptly notify Parent (after Buyer has notice thereof) and keep such other
party advised as to (i) any litigation or administrative proceeding pending
and known to such party or, to its actual knowledge, threatened against such
party that challenges the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) any
material adverse change in the results of operations or financial condition
of the Subsidiaries taken as a whole or Buyer, as the case may be.   (b)
Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify Parent if Buyer obtains
knowledge that any representation and warranty of Parent in this Agreement
and the Schedules hereto are not true and correct in all material respects,
or if Buyer obtains knowledge of any material errors in, or omissions from,
the Schedules to this Agreement or of any other condition or
circumstance that would excuse Buyer from its timely performance of its
obligations hereunder or give rise to a claim hereunder.   4.6. Certain
Equity Interest Transfers.   Prior to the Closing, Parent shall cause (i)
the redemption of all of the equity interests of Pentair Canada, Inc. owned
by Delta International Machinery Corp. and (ii) the proceeds of such
redemption to be distributed to Parent.   4.7. Guarantee Releases.   Prior
to or at the Closing, Parent shall obtain and deliver to the
Buyer unconditional releases of all guarantees by any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries of any obligations of Parent or any of its Affiliates other than
another Transferred Subsidiary.   4.8. Indebtedness.   Prior to or at the
Closing, Parent shall repay or cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to repay
all indebtedness for borrowed money, including for money borrowed from Parent
or any of its Affiliates, other than a Transferred Subsidiary, to the end
that, as of the Closing, none of the Transferred Subsidiaries shall have any
liabilities for indebtedness for borrowed money, including, without
limitation, obligations under Capital Leases and obligations with respect to
any Deferred Acquisition Price.   19    4.9. Exclusivity.   During the
period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates and each of their officers, directors, employees,
representatives and agents not to, directly or indirectly, encourage,
solicit, initiate, engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with
any person or entity (other than the Buyer) concerning any merger or
consolidation involving the Subsidiaries, any sale of material assets by the
Subsidiaries not in the ordinary course of business, any direct or indirect
sale of the capital stock of the Subsidiaries or any other business
combination involving the Subsidiaries other than in preparation for any
direct or indirect sale or transfer of the capital stock of the Subsidiaries
in a capital markets transaction, provided that Parent may not make public
disclosure of any such capital markets transaction until after this Agreement
has been terminated in accordance with Article 10.   4.10. Resignations.  
Effective upon the Closing, Parent shall cause all of its own
employees, directors and attorneys and all employees, directors and attorneys
of its Affiliates (other than the Subsidiaries) to resign from the boards of
directors of the Transferred Subsidiaries and from all positions as officers
of the Transferred Subsidiaries.   4.11. Agreements with Affiliates.  
Except as contemplated in the Transaction Services Agreement, effective upon
the Closing, all agreements between the Transferred Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and Parent or any of Parent\'s Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall be deemed to have been
terminated.   5. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS   5.1. Tax Matters.   (a) Returns
and Payments.   (i) Parent shall pay and be responsible for, and shall
be entitled to all refunds and credits of (A) all Income or Franchise Taxes
with respect to any of the Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period, including
any liability for Taxes arising out of the inclusion of any of the
Subsidiaries in any Consolidated Returns, (B) all Taxes with respect to an
Affiliated Group of which the Subsidiaries were members immediately prior to
the Closing Date for all taxable periods whatsoever, and (C) all Taxes
imposed on any Seller with respect to gain or other income from its sale of
the Equity Interests, the U.S. Intellectual Property, the Canadian Assets or
the Toolz Shares hereunder, and all taxes imposed on any deferred items
triggered into income by Treas. Reg. ss.1.1502-13 and any excess loss account
taken into income under Treas. Reg. ss.1.1502-19 on Parent\'s consolidated
federal income tax return for all periods through the end of the Closing
Date. Parent shall be responsible for the timely preparation and filing of
all Income or Franchise Tax Returns for Taxes of any Pre-Closing Period.
"Pre-Closing Period" means any taxable period that ends on or before the
Closing Date. "Consolidated Returns" means all Tax Returns with respect to
any Affiliated Group. "Affiliated Group" means one or    20   more
corporations which (A) included any of the Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
Date and (B) for purposes of the Tax laws of any Governmental Entity were
required to or elected to file Consolidated Returns with one or
more Affiliates of Parent other than another Subsidiary. The Buyer and Parent
(i) agree that the Transferred Subsidiaries shall not carry back in respect
of any consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Return any item of loss,
deduction or credit which arises in any taxable period ending after the
Closing Date to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, and
(ii) that Buyer shall not allow the amendment of any Tax Returns with respect
to Taxes of any of the Transferred Subsidiaries for any period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date without Parent\'s prior written consent.   (ii)
The Buyer shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed all Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries
other than Tax Returns for which Parent is responsible under Section
5.1(a)(i).   (iii) If any of the Transferred Subsidiaries are permitted or
required under applicable Tax Laws relating to Income or Franchise Taxes to
treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, the Buyer and
Parent shall cause such day to be treated as the last day of a taxable period
and will take such actions as may be necessary to treat the
Transferred Subsidiaries as if they ceased to be part of an Affiliated Group
as of the close of business on the Closing Date.   (iv) In any case where
applicable law relating to Income or Franchise Taxes does not permit or
require the election or agreement described in Section 5.1(a)(iii) to be
made, then, for purposes of this Agreement, a taxable year or taxable period
which begins before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period") shall be allocated between Parent and the Buyer using an
interim-closing-of-the-books method assuming that such taxable period ended
at the close of business on the Closing Date, except that (A) exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (such as the
deduction for depreciation) shall be apportioned on a per diem basis and (B)
in the case of a franchise Tax not based on income, Parent shall be
responsible for the amount of franchise Tax for the taxable year that would
have been imposed if such Tax were determined based on the assets
and liabilities of the Transferred Subsidiaries as of the Closing, or the
amount of franchise Tax for the taxable year based on the number of shares of
stock outstanding as of the Closing, whichever amount is applicable, in each
case multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
days from the beginning of the taxable year to the Closing Date and the
denominator of which shall be the number of days in the taxable year. Upon
prior timely written notice, Parent shall pay any amounts owed to Buyer
pursuant to this Section 5.1(a)(iv) within ten (10) days of such written
notice or ten (10) days prior to the date on which Buyer is required to cause
to be paid the related Income or Franchise Tax liability, whichever is later.
The Buyer shall be responsible for the timely preparation and filing of all
Tax Returns and the payment of all Income or Franchise Taxes due, if any, of
the Transferred Subsidiaries for any such period except that Parent shall be
responsible for the payment of all estimated Income or Franchise Taxes due
from any of the Subsidiaries relating to periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and the preparation and filing of all returns, notices, reports
or other documents required to be filed with such estimated Income or
Franchise Taxes and Parent shall provide copies thereof to Buyer. The Income
and Franchise Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the
last previous such return of the Transferred Subsidiaries (as applicable) and
the Buyer shall    21   consult Parent concerning each such Tax Return
and report all items with respect to the portion of the period ending on the
Closing Date in accordance with the instructions of Parent. The Buyer shall
cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to provide Parent with a copy of each
proposed Tax Return and such additional information regarding such Tax Return
as may be reasonably requested by Parent at least 30 days prior to the filing
of such Tax Return, except that in the case of a Tax Return related to a
monthly taxable period, the copy shall be provided to Parent at least 10 days
prior to the filing of such Tax Return. Within ten (10) days of the Buyer
providing Parent with a copy of any such Tax Return and a copy of Buyer\'s
detailed calculation of the Income or Franchise Taxes attributable to the
period prior to the Closing Date determined in accordance with the first
sentence of this Section 5.1(a)(iv), Parent shall pay to the Buyer the Income
or Franchise Taxes attributable to such period by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the Buyer.   (v)
Parent will prepare and deliver to the Buyers at least sixty days prior to
the due date thereof (taking into account any applicable extensions) a pro
forma Income or Franchise Tax return for the period from January 1st of the
year in which the Closing occurs through the Closing Date, for each taxing
jurisdiction for which the Subsidiaries must file a full calendar year
return. Any difference between the Income or Franchise Tax liability as
reflected on the pro forma Tax return and the estimated Tax payments
previously remitted by Parent shall be paid to the Buyer if such pro forma
Tax liability exceeds the estimated Tax payments. Any difference between the
Tax liability as reflected on the pro forma Tax return and estimated
Income or Franchise Tax payments previously remitted by Parent shall be paid
to Parent if such pro forma Tax liability is less than the estimated Tax
payments.   (vi) In preparing the Tax Returns referenced in this Section
5.1(a), neither party shall make or cause to be made any material
Tax election or change any material income Tax accounting method or period
without giving prior written notice to and receiving prior written consent of
the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); provided, however, such prior written consent shall not be required
if and to the extent such change or election (A) is required by Law and no
other reasonable method exists to comply with such Law or (B) will not
materially increase the amount of Taxes that would be owing for periods
covered by a Tax Return for which the other party has filing responsibility
or for which the other party is allocated Taxes hereunder.   (b) Tax
Audits. Buyer shall promptly notify Parent in writing upon receipt by Buyer
or any Affiliate of Buyer (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) of notice
of any pending or threatened Income or Franchise Tax audits, examination or
assessments ("Tax Audit") that may affect the Income or Franchise Tax
liabilities of the Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period. Parent shall have
the right, at its own expense, to control any Tax Audit, to initiate any
claim for refund, to contest, resolve and defend against any
assessment, notice of deficiency, or other adjustment or proposed adjustment
relating to any and all Tax liabilities of the Subsidiaries for any Pre
Closing Period. Parent shall not settle any Tax Audit to the extent that it
relates to the Transferred Subsidiaries in a manner which would materially
adversely affect them after the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld. Where
consent to a settlement is withheld by Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.1(b),
Buyer may continue any current proceeding or initiate any further proceedings
at its own expense, provided that any liability of Parent with respect to
such Tax    22   Audit, shall not exceed the liability that would have
resulted had Buyer not withheld its consent. The Buyer shall have the right,
at its own expense, to control any other Tax Audit, initiate any other claim
for refund, and contest, resolve and defend against any other assessment,
notice of deficiency, or other adjustment or proposed adjustment relating to
Income or Franchise Taxes with respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries;
provided that, with respect to any state, local or foreign Taxes for any
Straddle Period, the Buyer shall consult with Parent with respect to the
resolution of any issue that would affect Parent, and not settle any such
issue, or file any amended Tax Return relating to such issue, without the
prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not unreasonably be
withheld. Where consent to a settlement is withheld by Parent pursuant to
this Section 5.1(b), Parent may continue any current proceeding or initiate
any further proceedings at its own expense, provided that any liability of
Buyer with respect to such Tax Audit, shall not exceed the liability that
would have resulted had Parent not withheld its consent.   (c) Cooperation.
Buyer, Parent and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate in the
preparation of all Tax Returns for any Tax periods for which one party could
reasonably require the assistance of the other party in obtaining any
necessary information. Such cooperation shall include but not be limited to:
(i) furnishing prior years\' Tax Returns together with
accompanying schedules, (ii) provision of schedules, and related
documentation necessary to complete all Tax returns for Pre-Closing Periods,
(iii) provision of powers of attorney for the purpose of signing Tax Returns
and defending Tax Audits; and (iv) promptly forwarding copies of appropriate
notices and forms or other communications received from or sent to any
applicable Taxing Authority that relate to the Subsidiaries. The parties and
their respective Affiliates shall make their respective employees and
facilities available to the other party on a mutually convenient basis to
explain any documents or information provided hereunder. The Buyer shall
prepare and provide to Parent a package of Tax information materials,
including, without limitation, schedules, work papers and a limited power of
attorney (the "Tax Package") requested by Parent to enable Parent to prepare
and file (or merely prepare) all tax returns required to be prepared and
filed (or merely prepared) by Parent for periods prior to and including the
Closing Date. Parent shall provide the request for the Tax Package within
ninety (90) days of the Closing Date and the completed Tax Package shall be
delivered to parent within ninety (90) days of such request.   (d)
Termination of Tax-Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
arrangements with respect to or involving the Transferred Subsidiaries shall
be terminated prior to the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, none of
the Transferred Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods ending on or before the
Closing Date.   (e) Section 338(h)(10) Election. Parent and the Buyer
shall join, and shall cause each of their Affiliates to join, in making an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any corresponding elections
under state or local tax laws, with respect to the Purchaser\'s purchase of
the Equity Interests in all of the Transferred Subsidiaries that are eligible
U.S. entities, other than DeVilbiss, for federal income tax purposes. Subject
to the allocations determined under Section 2.3, Parent and Buyer shall cause
each of the Sellers and the Purchasers to cooperate fully with each other in
the making of such Section 338(h)(10) Election on Form 8023 and in the timely
filing of executed copies of Forms 8023 and 8883, the required   
23   schedules thereto and any similar state or local forms with the proper
Taxing Authorities. Parent and the Buyer shall report, and shall cause their
Affiliates to report, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
manner consistent with the making of such Section 338(h)(10) election.  
Within 120 days after the Closing Date, but not later than thirty days prior
to the filing due date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Parent a draft
of Forms 8023 and 8883 and Buyer shall in good faith consider any comments
made by Parent in preparing final drafts of such Forms.   (f) Section 338(g)
Election. Buyer may make or cause to be made, with prior written consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, a Code
Section 338(g) election (the "Section 338(g) Election") with respect to the
sale and purchase of the Foreign Subsidiaries. Buyer shall pay all Taxes
which result by reason of any such Section 338(g) Election.   (g) Buyer\'s
Taxes. Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, and Buyer and the Subsidiaries
shall jointly and severally indemnify Parent and its Affiliates against and
hold them harmless from any Liability for Taxes (which shall include, but not
be limited to, the utilization of any net operating loss or capital loss or
the utilization of any tax credits or other Tax attributes) arising from any
action by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Subsidiaries) from and after
the Closing, including, without limitation, any events or transactions
referenced in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(ii), any sale or other
disposition of assets of or by the Subsidiaries after the Closing or any
Section 338(g) Election made by Buyer with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of Parent ("Buyer\'s Taxes").   5.2. [Intentionally Omitted]   5.3.
Employee Matters.   (a) General.   (i) On the Closing Date, all of the
Active Employees of Pentair Canada, Inc. primarily involved in the Business
shall be transferred to the Purchaser of the Canadian Assets and the
employment of such Active Employees shall be considered continuous under
applicable Law. Except as otherwise provided herein with respect to specific
plans, programs or arrangements, for the six-month period immediately
following the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Transferred
Subsidiaries and the Purchaser of the Canadian Assets to, provide benefit
plans, programs and arrangements that are reasonably comparable in the
aggregate to the Subsidiary Benefit Plans, other than the Excluded Plans and
other than any Subsidiary Benefit Plan or portion thereof pursuant to
which benefits are provided in the form of Parent stock, rights to such
stock, or payments or other benefits directly derived from or directly based
upon the value of such stock.   (ii) Retention, Severance and Other
Agreements. Parent shall reimburse Buyer, within five (5) business days of
receipt of written notice from Buyer, for all obligations under the retention
agreements of Parent set forth on Schedule 5.3(a), and all other   
24   obligations to pay severance benefits, if any are due, to any Former
Employee. Except as otherwise provided herein, from and after the Closing,
Buyer shall or shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to honor in
accordance with their terms all existing individual employment, severance,
bonus, consulting or other individual compensation agreements or contracts
between any Transferred Subsidiary and any Active Employee in accordance with
their terms.   (iii) Service Credit. Without limiting any other
covenant herein, and except as provided under Section 5.3(b)(ii) with respect
to Active Employees participating in the DeVilbiss Cash Balance Plan, all
service credited to Active Employees participating in the Parent Pension Plan
through the Closing Date and all service credited to Active Employees of
Pentair Canada, Inc. primarily involved in the Business through the Closing
Date shall be recognized by Buyer, the Transferred Subsidiaries and the
Purchaser of the Canadian Assets for purposes of eligibility, participation,
vesting and benefit accrual without application of any preexisting condition
or similar exclusion that did not apply to such employees immediately prior
to the Closing Date.   (b) Parent Pension Plan.   (i) General. Parent
maintains a defined benefit pension plan that covers its eligible employees
and the eligible employees of its Affiliates including certain of the
Subsidiaries (the "Parent Pension Plan"). The Parent Pension Plan has two
separate benefit formulas that apply to different current employees of the
Subsidiaries: (A) a cash balance formula that in general covers eligible
employees of DeVilbiss; and (B) a final average pay benefit formula that in
general covers eligible employees of Porter-Cable and Pentair Tool and
Equipment Sales Co. As of the Closing Date, as applicable, the Transferred
Subsidiaries shall cease to be participating employers under the Parent
Pension Plan and Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all such action as
may be necessary to effect such cessation of participation.   (ii) Cash
Balance and Related Benefits.   (A) Upon the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause the benefits accrued through such Closing Date by all Active Employees
of DeVilbiss who are participants in the cash balance formula under the
Parent Pension Plan (the "DeVilbiss Cash Balance Plan") to become fully
vested. Subsequently, upon qualification of any such participant to receive
retirement benefits from the Parent Pension Plan, Parent shall cause the
appropriate fiduciary to pay such retirement benefits pursuant to the terms
of the DeVilbiss Cash Balance Plan. Neither the Buyer nor any Affiliate of
the Buyer (including any of the Subsidiaries) or any of their plans shall
have any responsibility for any benefits or other obligations under or
attributable to the DeVilbiss Cash Balance Plan.   (B) The Buyer agrees to
enroll the Active Employees of the Subsidiaries who are participants as of
the Closing Date in the DeVilbiss Cash Balance Plan in a defined benefit
pension plan, which shall be tax-qualified under Code Section 401(a),
maintained by the Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer ("Buyer Pension Plan");
and Buyer agrees that such employees\' service with the Subsidiaries or any
of their ERISA Affiliates prior to the Closing Date shall be recognized under
the Buyer Pension Plan for eligibility and vesting purposes, but not for
benefit accrual purposes.   25    (iii) Traditional Plan.   (A) As soon
as practicable after the Closing Date and after complete compilation and
transmittal by the Transferred Subsidiaries of relevant information to
determine the amount to be transferred with respect to the liabilities
described in this Section 5.3(b)(iii)(A), Parent shall cause the transfer
from the Parent Pension Plan to the Buyer Pension Plan of assets
(in accordance with paragraphs (B) and (C) below) and liabilities which
are attributable to the Active Employees who are participants as of the
Closing Date in the Parent Pension Plan, other than those Active Employees
who are participants in the DeVilbiss Cash Balance Plan.   (B) The amount
of assets to be transferred from the Parent Pension Plan shall be equal to
the amount determined as of the Closing Date pursuant to Code Section 414(1),
using the actuarial assumptions used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation pursuant to Section 1.414(1)-(b)(5)(ii) of the Treasury
Regulations which is attributable to the Active Employees, other than the
Active Employees who are participants in the DeVilbiss Cash Balance Plan, who
are participants as of the Closing Date in the Parent Pension Plan (the
"Transfer Amount"). The above described calculation of the amount to
be transferred from the Parent Pension Plan to the Buyer Pension Plan shall
be made by the Parent\'s actuary. The Buyer\'s actuary may comment with
respect to the calculation of the amount to be so transferred, and any such
comments shall, in good faith, be taken into account by Parent\'s actuary.
Within a reasonable period of time before the transfer, Parent\'s actuary
shall provide such other information as may be reasonably necessary to permit
Buyer\'s actuary to comment with respect to the calculation of such
amount.   (C) All assets transferred under this Section 5.3(b)(iii) shall
consist of cash and marketable and other liquid securities (other than Parent
stock or other securities). The transfer contemplated herein shall
comply with all requirements of Code Sections 414(l) and 401(a)(12). Pending
completion of the transfers contemplated by this Section 5.3(b)(iii), any
benefits that are payable to Active Employees under the Parent Pension Plan
shall be paid out of such plan. Interest shall be paid on the Transfer Amount
for the period from the Closing Date to the date of transfer at the rate of
5.0%, and the transfer amount shall be adjusted to reflect benefit payments
and expenses paid after the Closing Date by the Parent Pension Plan which are
related to the obligations being transferred to the Buyer Pension Plan.
Pending the completion of such transfers, Parent will cooperate with the
Buyer with respect to plan administration, disbursement of benefits and other
pertinent information.   (D) The Buyer agrees to enroll the Active
Employees described in paragraph (B) immediately preceding who are
participants in the Buyer Pension Plan, and the Buyer Pension Plan shall be
liable for benefits with respect to such Active Employees accrued under the
Parent Pension Plan prior to the Closing Date, including any early retirement
benefits and ancillary benefits related to their accrued benefits under the
Parent Pension Plan as of the Closing Date, to the extent of the liabilities
transferred in accordance with this Section 5.3(b)(iii). The Buyer agrees
that neither Parent nor the Parent Pension Plan shall have any further
responsibility for any benefits or other obligations with respect to the
liabilities so transferred.   26    (c) Porter-Cable Hourly Plan. Porter-
Cable maintains the Retirement Plan for Hourly-Rated Employees of Porter-
Cable (the "Porter-Cable Hourly Plan") for hourly-rated employees and former
employees and their beneficiaries. As of and following the Closing Date,
Porter-Cable shall retain responsibility for the Porter-Cable Hourly Plan,
including the funding and administration thereof; provided, however, as soon
as reasonably possible after the Closing, Buyer shall designate or establish
a separate qualified funding vehicle to hold the assets of the Porter-Cable
Hourly Plan. Subject to Parent\'s verification of such funding vehicle and
receipt from Buyer of Buyer\'s commitment that it will take or cause to be
taken all steps as are reasonably necessary to ensure that such funding
arrangement is tax exempt under Code Section 501(a), Parent shall cause the
trustee of the Master Trust which holds the assets of the Porter-Cable Hourly
Plan to transfer the assets of such trust allocable to the Porter-Cable
Hourly Plan to the trustee or other appropriate fiduciary or custodian of the
funding vehicle so established. Subject to ERISA and other applicable Law,
the assets so transferred shall consist of cash, marketable and other liquid
securities (other than Parent stock or other securities). Pending such
transfer, Porter-Cable shall continue to process benefit applications and the
like under the Porter-Cable Hourly Plan consistent with past practice, except
as otherwise required by Law, and shall be solely responsible for such
processing, and the applicable fiduciary under the Master Trust shall pay
such benefits as so processed. Buyer agrees that from and after the transfer
date, neither Parent nor any Affiliate of Parent or any of their plans shall
have any responsibility for any benefits or other obligations accrued under
the Porter-Cable Hourly Plan, whether accrued before or after
the Closing.   (d) Delta Tupelo Hourly Plan. Delta International
Machinery Corp. sponsors the Delta Tupelo Hourly-Rated Employees Pension Plan
(the "Delta Tupelo Hourly Plan") for bargaining employees and former
employees of Delta Tupelo and their beneficiaries. On or prior to the Closing
Parent shall, or shall cause Delta International Machinery Corp. to, transfer
sponsorship of the Delta Tupelo Hourly Plan to Parent or an Affiliate of
Parent, other than a Subsidiary. Parent agrees that neither Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates, including the Subsidiaries, shall have any liability or
responsibility for any benefits or other obligations accrued under the Delta
Tupelo Hourly Plan, whether accrued before or after the Closing.   (e)
401(k) Plan.   (i) As of the Closing Date, the Subsidiaries shall cease to
be participating employers under the Pentair, Inc. Retirement Savings
and Stock Incentive Plan (the "Parent 401(k) Plan") and Parent shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such action as may be necessary to effect such
cessation of participation. Notwithstanding such cessation, however, the
Subsidiaries shall timely transmit to the trustee of the Parent 401(k) Plan
and properly account for, in accordance with the customary procedures,
amounts withheld from Active Employees\' salary, wages, or other covered
compensation, for deposit with such trustee.   (ii) As soon as
administratively practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, enroll the
active employees of the Subsidiaries who, as of the Closing Date, are
participants, (or are otherwise eligible to participate in the Parent 401(k)
Plan) in a profit-sharing plan maintained by the Buyer that is qualified
under Code Section 401(a) and that includes a cash or deferred arrangement
which qualifies under Code Section 401(k) and the opportunity to receive a
matching contribution (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan").   27    (iii) The Buyer
401(k) Plan shall be tax-qualified under Code Section 401(a), and shall
provide Active Employees with credit for service completed (A) with Parent
and its ERISA Affiliates (including the Subsidiaries for periods ending with
the Closing Date) and their respective predecessors for periods prior to the
Closing Date and (B) with Buyer and its ERISA Affiliates for periods after
the Closing Date) for purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to
participate under the Buyer 401(k) Plan.   (iv) As soon as administratively
practicable after the Closing Date, and after complete compilation and
transmittal by the Subsidiaries of relevant information to determine the
amount to be transferred for Active Employees who are participants under
Parent 401(k) Plan (and any person deriving benefits through such a
participant including, without limitation, an Alternate Payee), Parent shall
cause the transfer of (A) the account balances of the Active Employees and
(B) assets having a value equal to said account balances (the "401(k) Plan
Transfer") to the Buyer 401(k) Plan. Such transfer shall include a
contribution for Active Employees to be made by Parent prior to said transfer
in an amount equal to the sum of (x) Employer Matching
Contributions attributable to the Participant Before-Tax Matched Deposits (as
such terms are defined in the Parent 401(k) Plan) for the Active Employees
for the period from January 1st of the year in which the Closing occurs
through the Closing Date, plus (y) an Employer Discretionary Contribution (as
such term is defined in the Parent 401(k) Plan) for the period from January
1st of the year in which the Closing occurs through the Closing Date. The
amount of both of said contributions shall be determined in accordance with
the relevant provisions of Parent 401(k) Plan. The transfer from the Parent
401(k) Plan shall be in the form of cash, marketable and other liquid
securities (other than Parent stock or other securities). Outstanding
participant loans shall, subject to the approval of the appropriate fiduciary
of the Buyer 401(k) Plan, be transferred "in kind." Parent shall cause all of
such employees to become fully vested in the assets transferred to the Buyer
401(k) Plan pursuant to this Section 5.3(e). The Buyer shall, prior to the
Closing, notify Parent in writing of the identity of the Buyer 401(k) Plan
and thereafter shall cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept the transfers
referred to above. The Buyer shall assume all responsibility for
the management and administration of the account balances of the Active
Employees of the Subsidiaries to the extent of the assets transferred to the
Buyer 401(k) Plan from the Parent 401(k) Plan. Neither the Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates shall assume any obligations or liabilities under or
attributable to the Parent 401(k) Plan. Prior to the transfer of assets
contemplated by this Section 5.3(e), Buyer or its applicable Affiliate, if
consented to by the affected employee, shall withhold from such employee\'s
pay loan repayments relating to any outstanding loans to such employee under
the Parent 401(k) Plan, and shall promptly forward such withholding to the
Parent 401(k) Plan and, subject to approval of the appropriate fiduciary, the
Parent 401(k) Plan shall accept and properly credit such repayment to said
participant\'s loan.   (v) Pending the 401(k) Plan Transfer, and except
as otherwise required to effect such transfer, Active Employees (and any
person deriving benefits through such an employee including, without
limitation, an Alternate Payee) may continue to exercise such rights as are
otherwise available to inactive participants under the Parent 401(k) Plan
with respect to their account balances; provided, however, such an Active
Employee shall not be considered to have severed or otherwise terminated
employment for purposes of entitlement to request a distribution under Parent
401(k) Plan so long as such individual is employed by a Subsidiary, Buyer or
any ERISA Affiliate of Buyer. Buyer shall, or shall cause the
Subsidiaries   28   to, cooperate with Parent with respect to any
reasonable request made by Parent or the trustee of the Parent 401(k) Plan to
effectuate any such administrative procedures pending such plan transfer,
including such procedures as may be appropriate for the processing of
repayments with respect to participant loans.   (vi) After the 401(k) Plan
Transfer, none of Parent, the Parent 401(k) Plan, any fiduciary of the Parent
401(k) Plan or any of their agents or assigns shall have any responsibility
or obligation to pay or otherwise provide to the Active Employees whose
account balances were included in the 401(k) Plan Transfer (and any person
deriving benefits through such employee including, without limitation, an
Alternate Payee) any benefits accrued or provided for under the Parent 401(k)
Plan to the extent of the assets so transferred. To the extent relevant
contributions made by the Active Employees whose account balances were
transferred to the Buyer 401(k) Plan as provided herein must be taken into
account by the Parent 401(k) Plan in applying applicable discrimination tests
under the code for the prior year which includes the Closing Date, Parent may
direct that any return, refund or forfeiture necessary to satisfy such test
may be taken before, and be reflected in the amount of, the 401(k) Plan
Transfer. If such return, refund or forfeiture is to be made after the 401(k)
Plan Transfer, Buyer shall cause the Buyer 401(k) Plan to take such steps as
are reasonably requested by Parent to effectuate such action.   (vii)
ESOP.   (A) As of the Closing Date, the Subsidiaries shall cease to be
participating employers under the Parent Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the
"ESOP") and Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all such action as
may be necessary to effect such cessation of participation.   (B) As soon
as reasonably possible after the Closing Date, Active Employees with account
balances under the ESOP shall be entitled to request a lump sum distribution
of such account balances and, if requested by such an individual, the Buyer
401(k) Plan, or such other tax-qualified defined contribution plan as may be
designated or established by Buyer (the "Buyer Rollover Plan") shall accept a
direct transfer pursuant to Code Section 401(a)(31) or a participant rollover
of such account balances; provided, however, (A) no such distribution or
transfer shall be made solely by reason of the sale of the shares to the
extent such a distribution or transfer may adversely affect the qualified
status of the ESOP or the Buyer Rollover Plan, (B) any such distribution or
transfer shall be subject to the otherwise applicable benefit payment rules
and procedures under the ESOP and (C) in no event shall the Buyer Rollover
Plan be obligated to accept a direct transfer or rollover unless made in cash
or a cash equivalent. Pending such a distribution or transfer or, in the
event such a distribution or transfer is not made and except as otherwise
required under the Code or ERISA, Active Employees shall be entitled to
retain or receive their benefits under the ESOP subject to such rules,
procedures and limitations which apply to them or which otherwise apply to
terminated vested participants under the ESOP.   29    (f) Other
Retirement Plan Arrangements.   (i) As of the Closing Date, the Transferred
Subsidiaries shall cease to be participating employers under the Excluded
Plans, and Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all such actions as may
be necessary to effectuate such cessation of participation.   (ii) As soon
as administratively practicable following the Closing Date, Parent shall
transfer, or shall cause to be transferred, to a trust or other account
arrangement established or designated by Buyer to hold the assets so
transferred, which may be a general asset account of the Buyer or an
Affiliate, (the "Buyer NQ Funding Arrangement"), the entire value of
each Active Employee\'s (and any person deriving benefits through them)
account under the Pentair Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the
"Parent NQ 401(k) Plan"), except as to any Active Employee who thirty (30)
days prior to the transfer date has terminated all employment (and by then
not returned to such employment) with Buyer and any of its ERISA Affiliates,
including the Transferred Subsidiaries (the "NQ 401(k) Plan Transfer"). With
respect to Active Employees whose accounts are part of such plan transfer,
subject to applicable Law, the transfer shall consist of cash, marketable and
other liquid securities (other than Parent stock or other securities), or, as
agreed to by the appropriate fiduciary under the Parent NQ 401(k) Plan and
Buyer or its designee. The Buyer NQ Funding Arrangement shall provide to such
Active Employees the opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on the
assets transferred.   (iii) Pending the NQ 401(k) Plan Transfer, and except
as otherwise required to effect such transfer, Active Employees (and any
person deriving benefits through them) may continue to exercise such rights
as are otherwise available to them under the Parent NQ 401(k) Plan, with
respect to their account balances thereunder; provided, however, an Active
Employee shall not be considered to have severed or otherwise terminated
employment for purposes of entitlement to request a distribution under the
Parent NQ 401(k) Plan as long as such individual is employed by a Subsidiary,
Buyer or any ERISA Affiliate of Buyer. Buyer shall or shall cause the
Transferred Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent with respect to any request
made by Parent or the trustee of the Parent NQ 401(k) Plan to effectuate any
such administrative procedures pending such plan transfer, including such
procedures as may be appropriate for the processing of repayments with
respect to participant loans.   (iv) None of Parent, the Parent NQ 401(k)
Plan or any fiduciary of the Parent NQ 401(k) Plan shall have any liability
or obligation to pay or otherwise provide to the Active Employees whose
account balances were included in the NQ 401(k) Plan Transfer (and any person
deriving benefits through them) to the extent of the assets so transferred,
and Buyer shall assume full liability for such benefits.   (v) Parent shall
assume the obligation of the Subsidiaries, to provide benefits under the
Parent NQ 401(k) Plan to any Former Employee (and any person deriving
benefits through them), and any assets held to pay such benefits shall be
retained by the grantor trust related to the Parent NQ 401(k) Plan. After the
Closing Date, none of Buyer or the Transferred Subsidiaries shall have any
liability or obligation to pay or otherwise provide any benefits accrued or
provided for under the Parent Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan or the
Parent Restoration Plan and Parent shall assume full responsibility and
liability for such benefits.   30    (g) Health and Welfare Benefit
Plans.   (i) Termination of Coverage. Effective on the Closing Date, Parent
will cause the cessation of coverage under all insurance policies, contracts,
programs or similar arrangements through which Parent has provided health or
welfare benefits to or on behalf of Active Employees, or directors of the
Subsidiaries (each such policy, contract, program or similar arrangement
a "Parent Sponsored Benefit Plan").   (ii) With respect to any Active
Employees or Former Employees of the Subsidiaries, and any beneficiaries or
dependents thereof, the Parent shall retain (i) all liabilities and
obligations arising under any life, accident, medical, dental or disability
plan or similar arrangement (whether or not insured) to the extent that such
liability or obligation relates to claims incurred (whether or not reported)
on or prior to the Closing Date, under a Parent Sponsored Benefit Plan, and
(ii) all liabilities and obligations arising under any worker\'s compensation
laws to the extent such liability or obligation relates to claims incurred on
or prior to the Closing Date provided that, in the case of Active Employees,
the claims therefore are made prior to the earlier of (A) ninety (90) days
after the Closing or (B) the date on which the closure of the facility at
which the claiming employee works is announced. Parent shall retain
responsibility for providing health, medical, dental, hospitalization, life
insurance or similar benefits (including, without limitation,
reimbursement for Medicare premiums) to any employee or Former Employee of
the Subsidiaries eligible therefore who retires or has retired on or before
the Closing Date subject to the terms and conditions of the Parent Sponsored
Benefit Plans under which said retiree benefits are provided. Buyer shall be
responsible for providing any post-retirement medical, life or similar
benefits to Active Employees as of the Closing if and only to the extent
Buyer, in its sole discretion, agrees to provide such post-retirement
benefits. Buyer shall not be obligated by this Agreement to provide post-
retirement, health, medical, dental, hospitalization, life insurance or
similar benefits (including, without limitation, reimbursement for Medicare
premiums), or any particular level of such benefits, to Active Employees of
the Transferred Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date.   (iii) Parent
Flexible Benefit Plan. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause
the Subsidiaries to, make available a cafeteria plan within the meaning of
Code Section 125 and under such plan, shall honor claims thereafter made or
outstanding claims that have not yet then been reimbursed but which have been
made by Active Employees who were, prior to Closing, participants in
Parent\'s Flexible Benefit Plan with respect to deferrals made by such
participants during such portion of the plan year which had elapsed prior to
the Closing Date. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date,
Parent shall transfer to Buyer all amounts Parent has received in respect of
such deferrals, net of any amounts previously paid by Parent to said
participants as reimbursement for eligible medical and dependent
care expenses incurred during said plan year, together with such books and
records of Parent as are specific to the eligible Active Employees and
necessary to permit Buyer to administer such plan. Buyer agrees that from and
after the transfer date, neither Parent nor Parent\'s Flexible Benefit Plan
shall have any responsibility for any benefits or other obligations with
respect to the amounts so transferred.   (iv) WARN Act. Parent shall be
responsible for all obligations or liabilities under the WARN Act, under any
other Laws which may provide to employees    31   protections similar
to the WARN Act or under any Contracts, which may arise from actions taken
before the Closing Date including the Delta Tupelo Closure. Buyer shall be
responsible for all other obligations or liabilities under the WARN Act, or
under any other Laws which provide to employees protections similar to the
WARN Act, resulting from actions taken by Buyer or the
Transferred Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date, including the
relocation of any U.S. operations from their current location.   (h)
Cooperation. With respect to such actions as may be necessary to effectuate
the provisions of this Section 5.3, but only to the extent otherwise
consistent with each party\'s duties and responsibilities with respect to
employee benefit plans under applicable Law, Parent and Buyer shall, and
Buyer shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate
with each other with respect to such matters, including but not limited to
(i) sharing notices or other information related to employee benefit plans to
be filed or provided to Government Entities pursuant to the Code or ERISA
with respect to the sale of the Equity Interests and the transactions
described in this Section 5.3, including without limitation any notice
required under ERISA Section 4043, (ii) gathering information necessary for
each party to file annual reports with the Internal Revenue Service or such
other governmental filing as may be required with respect to employee benefit
plans for reporting periods ending in or with the plan year which includes
the Closing Date, (iii) properly effectuating any blackout notice and
procedures required pursuant to 29 CFR ss.2520.101-3(b) in connection with
the applicable plan asset transfers hereunder and (iv) providing access to
files and records as needed to permit each party to fulfill their obligations
under, or otherwise implement the relevant provisions of, this Agreement.  
(i) Transition Services.   (i) From and after the Closing until the later of
June 30, 2005 or six months after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the
Subsidiaries to, subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 5.3(i),
provide Parent such administrative and advisory services with respect to the
Subsidiary Benefit Plans retained by Parent as Parent reasonably requests
(the "Benefit Plan Services"). Upon prior written notice, Parent may, at its
option, direct Buyer and/or the Subsidiaries to no longer provide all or any
of such Benefit Plan Services.   (ii) Buyer shall cause the Subsidiaries to
make available to Parent such personnel as are reasonably required to perform
the Benefit Plan Services at no cost to Parent; provided, however, that
Parent shall reimburse Buyer for Buyer\'s or the Subsidiaries\' actual,
documented out-of-pocket expenses with respect to such Benefit Plan Services
within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice for such expenses.   (iii)
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Subsidiaries to, cooperate with and provide
assistance to Parent consistent with the terms and conditions hereof to
enable (A) the full performance of all obligations hereunder and (B) the
review of books and records of the Subsidiaries as they relate to the
provision of Benefit Plan Services; such cooperation and assistance to
include without limitation providing Parent, its representatives and its
agents with reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable advance notice, to their employees, representatives and
agents and their books, records and offices relating to the Benefit Plan
Services provided under this Section 5.3(i).   32    5.4. Post-Closing
Access to Information.   For a period of seven (7) years following the
Closing Date, or, with respect to records relating to Tax liabilities of the
Subsidiaries, if shorter, until the expiration of any applicable statute of
limitations for assessment or refund of Taxes of assessments thereof, each
party hereto shall provide, and shall cause its appropriate personnel to
provide, when reasonably requested to do so by another party hereto, access
to all tax, financial, accounting and personnel records of or relating to the
Subsidiaries and the right to make copies or extracts therefrom at its
expense. No party shall, nor shall it permit its Affiliates to, intentionally
dispose of, alter or destroy any such books, records and other data without
giving thirty (30) days\' prior written notice to the other parties and
permitting the other parties hereto, at their expense, to examine, duplicate
or repossess such records, files, documents and correspondence.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.4, while the existence of an
adversarial proceeding between the parties will not abrogate or suspend the
provisions of this Section 5.4 as to such records or other information
directly pertinent to such dispute, the parties may not utilize this Section
5.4 but rather, absent agreement, must utilize the rules of discovery.  
5.5. Further Assurances.   From and after the Closing, the parties agree to
execute and deliver, or to cause to be executed and delivered, all further
documents and instruments and to take all further action as shall be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to confirm or carry out the provisions
and intent of this Agreement.   5.6. Corporate Name and Logo.   Buyer
acknowledges that Parent and its Affiliates have the absolute and exclusive
proprietary right to all names, trade names, trade marks, service names and
service marks incorporating "Pentair" and Parent\'s corporate logo or any
derivation thereof and any corporate symbols or logos related thereto.
Buyer agrees that it will not, and will cause the Transferred Subsidiaries
not to, use the name "Pentair" or Parent\'s corporate logo or any symbol or
logo incorporating such name in connection with the sale of any products or
services or otherwise in the conduct of their businesses. As soon as possible
following the Closing, Buyer shall cause each Transferred Subsidiary with a
name including the word "Pentair" to file with an appropriate Government
Entity an amendment to such Transferred Subsidiary\'s charter or other
organizational documents eliminating the word "Pentair" from such
Subsidiary\'s name. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a reasonable period of
time following the Closing Date not to exceed one (1) year, the Buyer and its
Affiliates, including the Transferred Subsidiaries, shall be permitted to
use, sell and distribute any products, packaging, promotional and advertising
materials, letterhead, stationary, business cards and other personal property
that bears the name and/or the corporate logo of Parent to the extent that
such items (i) are owned by the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, or (ii)
were used by the Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date and cannot be ordered
or acquired by the Subsidiaries without such name or logo without
unreasonable cost or delay. As soon as possible following the Closing, Parent
shall cause each of its Affiliates, including Porter-Cable de Mexico S.A. de
C.V. if it is not dissolved prior to the Closing Date, with a name that
includes a trademark or a trade name associated with the Business to file
with    33   an appropriate Government Entity an amendment to such
Affiliate\'s charter or other organizational documents eliminating such word
or words from such Affiliate\'s name.   5.7. No Competition.   (a) During
the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth anniversary
of the Closing Date, Parent will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, conduct or engage in the Business (a "Competitive
Business"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit Parent or any of its Affiliates from (a) owning securities of
corporations engaged in a Competitive Business that are listed on a national
securities exchange or traded in the national over-the-counter market in an
amount which shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of
any such corporation or (b) acquiring any corporation or other
entity partially engaged in a Competitive Business; provided that such
activities do not exceed ten percent (10%) of the revenues or net equity of
the acquired corporation or other entity and that Parent shall use reasonable
efforts to divest the Competitive Business as soon as practicable.   (b)
During the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, neither the Parent nor any of its Affiliates
will, directly or indirectly employ, engage, contract for or solicit the
services in any capacity of any person who is employed by any of
the Subsidiaries at any time as Parent or its Affiliates seeks to employ,
engage, contract for or solicit the services of such person.   5.8.
Insurance.   (a) Commercial General Liability/Products Liability. Prior
to the Closing Date, commercial general liability, including products
liability, insurance coverage has been provided to certain Subsidiaries
listed on Schedule 5.8 (the "CGL Captive Insured Subsidiaries") under
insurance policies (the "CGL Policies") issued by Penwald Insurance Company,
a captive insurance company of the Parent ("Penwald"). Coverage under the CGL
Policies and all other insurance coverage for the Subsidiaries shall be
canceled effective on the Closing Date and neither Parent nor Penwald shall
have any further obligation to provide insurance coverage for occurrences,
accidents or diseases, as the case may be, taking place or arising after the
Closing Date. However, to the extent the CGL Policies afford coverage, or
continue to afford coverage, for occurrences, accidents or diseases, as the
case may be, taking place on or prior to the Closing Date (collectively, "CGL
Pre-Closing Occurrences"), Buyer shall, and shall cause the CGL Captive
Insured Subsidiaries to:   (i) Comply with all terms and conditions of the
claims handling procedures set forth in Schedule 5.8, as such may be amended
by Penwald from time to time with written notice to Buyer, for any CGL Pre-
Closing Occurrences covered by the CGL Policies;   (ii) Comply with all
terms and conditions of any CGL Policies and any other umbrella or excess
insurance policies affording coverage for CGL Pre-Closing Occurrences;
and   34    (iii) Provide Penwald, at no cost to Penwald,
reasonable access to the CGL Captive Insured Subsidiaries\' (A) product
engineers and other personnel and (B) documents, documentation and other
records, when, and as necessary, for consultation relative to CGL Pre-Closing
Occurrence claims issues. This access shall include, but is not limited to,
access for the purpose of reviewing and preparing claims and litigation
reports, providing written analyses and consultation relative to product
design and construction and serving as witnesses relative to claims and
litigation arising from or based upon CGL Pre-Closing Occurrences.  Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer agrees that the CGL Captive
Insured Subsidiaries may only submit claims for payment under the CGL
Policies with respect to CGL Pre-Closing Occurrences if and to the extent
Buyer and the CGL Captive Insured Subsidiaries have complied with all terms
and conditions of the Claims Handling Procedures set forth in Schedule
5.8.   (b) Workers Compensation/Commercial Automobile Insurance Coverage
Issued by Penwald. Prior to the Closing Date, primary workers compensation
and automobile deductible reimbursement insurance coverage has been provided
to certain Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 5.8 (the "WC/Auto Captive Insured
Subsidiaries") under insurance policies (the "Deductible
Reimbursement Policies") issued by Penwald. On the Closing Date, all
Deductible Reimbursement Policies shall be cancelled flat and Penwald shall
afford no further coverage, nor be liable for any additional payments, to the
WC/Auto Captive Insured Subsidiaries for any losses or expenses based upon,
arising from or attributable to claims, occurrences, accidents or diseases,
as the case may be (collectively, "WC/Auto Occurrences"), regardless of when
such WC/Auto Occurrences first arose (or arise), or were (or are) first
reported to or discovered by the WC/Auto Captive Insured Subsidiaries or
Penwald.   (c) Workers Compensation/Commercial Automobile
Insurance Coverage Issued by Insurers Other Than Penwald. To the extent there
is insurance coverage that was issued prior to the Closing Date (other than
coverage issued by Penwald) that affords coverage, or continues to afford
coverage, for any workers compensation and employers liability or commercial
automobile liability occurrences, accidents or diseases, as the case may be
(collectively, "Pre-Closing WC/Auto Occurrences"), attributable to the
WC/Auto Captive Insured Subsidiaries, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
WC/Auto Captive Insured Subsidiaries to:   (i) Cooperate with all insurers
affording such coverage to the full extent provided in any policies affording
coverage for Pre-Closing WC/Auto Occurrences, to include cooperation in the
continuing provision and administration of any and all ongoing claims related
services relative to the Pre-Closing WC/Auto Occurrences, as may be required
by the insurers; and   (ii) Comply with all other terms and conditions of
any workers compensation and employers liability or commercial automobile
liability insurance policies affording coverage to the WC/Auto Captive
Insured Subsidiaries, it being understood that Parent shall be responsible
for the payment of all obligations attributable to the WC/Auto Captive
Insured Subsidiaries, including any claims expense (both allocated loss
adjustment expense and unallocated loss adjustment expense) and loss invoices
under the terms and conditions of any workers compensation and employers
liability or commercial automobile liability insurance policy affording
coverage for Pre-Closing WC/Auto Occurrences.   35    (d) Limitation of
Coverage. Nothing in this Section 5.8 shall be construed to expand the
coverage provided under the CGL Policies nor the Deductible Reimbursement
Policies. The coverage under the CGL Policies and the Deductible
Reimbursement Policies shall be strictly limited to their respective terms,
conditions and exclusions. Notwithstanding the preceding, it is
also expressly understood and agreed that no CGL Policy issued by Penwald
shall afford any coverage for:   (i) bodily injury, personal injury or
medical payments caused by any latent disease including, but not limited to,
asbestosis, silicosis, mesothelioma, emphysema, pneumoconiosis, pulmonary
fibrosis, pleuritis, endothelioma or any lung disease or any ailment caused
by, or aggravated by exposure, inhalation, consumption or absorption of
asbestos fibers or dust or silica dust;   (ii) any property damage due to
or arising out of the actual or alleged presence of asbestos or silica dust
in any form, including the costs of remedial investigations or feasibility
studies, or to the costs of testing, monitoring, cleaning or removal of any
property or substance; or   (iii) bodily injury, property damage,
advertising injury, personal injury or medical payments or any other action
based upon the supervision, removal, instructions, recommendations,
warranties (expressed or implied), warnings or advice given or withheld
regarding asbestos fibers or dust or silica dust.   5.9. Delta Tupelo
Closure.   Parent shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
complete its plans for the closure of the Delta Tupelo Facility including the
transfer of the manufacturing operations and production equipment previously
located at the Delta Tupelo Facility to other Subsidiary Facilities and the
termination of all Employees employed at the Delta Tupelo Facility (the
"Delta Tupelo Closure") by the Closing Date or as soon thereafter as is
reasonably practicable. There are thirty-two (32) components (the "Delta
Parts") currently produced at the Delta Tupelo Facility that have not yet
been the subject of an alternate sourcing arrangement. If Parent has not
otherwise arranged for alternative sourcing for the Delta Parts (including by
relocation of the manufacturing operations and production equipment used in
producing such parts to another Subsidiary Facility) by the Closing, Parent
shall assure that Buyer will have a supply of the Delta Parts and such other
parts as are currently being produced at the Delta Tupelo Facility sufficient
to produce the products that use the Delta Parts through March 31, 2005 in
the volumes of such products contemplated by the Business\' manufacturing
forecasts as of the Closing Date. If, in order to comply with its obligations
under the preceding sentence, Parent is required to continue the operation of
the Delta Tupelo Facility after the Closing, Parent shall also manufacture
such other parts used in the Business as Parent would manufacture if it were
operating the Delta Tupelo Facility for its own account and Buyer shall pay
to Parent the full cost of the manufacturing of the Delta Parts and such
other parts after the Closing Date. Buyer and Parent shall cooperate in
formulating a plan for alternative sourcing for the Delta Parts (including by
the relocation, after the Closing, of such manufacturing operations to
another Subsidiary Facility or any other facility designated by Buyer;
provided that Buyer shall be responsible for all costs of such relocation in
excess of the costs to relocate such manufacturing operations to
Jackson,    36   Tennessee). Such cooperation shall include an
obligation of Buyer to use its commercially reasonable best efforts during
the period after the Closing and prior to July 1, 2005 to find an alternative
source for the Delta Parts. Buyer agrees that Parent shall not be required to
continue manufacturing of Delta Parts after December 31, 2004. If Buyer has
not otherwise arranged for alternative sourcing for all or substantially all
of the Delta Parts (including by relocation of the manufacturing operations
and production equipment use in producing such parts to another facility) by
April 1, 2005, Parent shall pay to Buyer the sum of $100,000. If Buyer has
not otherwise arranged for alternative sourcing for all or substantially all
of the Delta Parts (including by relocation of the manufacturing operations
and production equipment use in producing such parts to another facility) by
July 1, 2005, Parent shall pay to Buyer the sum of $50,000. Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall either sell the Delta Tupelo Facility to a third party
or transfer ownership of the Delta Tupelo Facility to Parent or an Affiliate
of Parent other than a Subsidiary. Parent shall be responsible for all costs
related to the Delta Tupelo Closure and shall indemnify the Buyer and its
Affiliates against all such costs.   5.10. Ellerbrake Litigation.   After
the Closing, the Buyer will, or will cause its Affiliates, including the
Transferred Subsidiaries, to continue to administer the performance of
the terms of the settlement of the Ellerbrake Litigation subject to
compliance by Parent of Parent\'s obligation to indemnify the Buyer with
respect thereto pursuant to Section 8.1.   5.11. Assignment of Contracts
and Rights.   (a) Anything in this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
assign any Contract or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder
or resulting therefrom if an attempted assignment thereof or the change in
control of a Transferred Subsidiary, without the consent of a third party
thereto, would constitute a breach or other contravention thereof, be
ineffective with respect to any party thereto or in any way adversely affect
the rights of Parent, a Subsidiary, Buyer, or any Affiliates of Parent or
Buyer hereunder.   (b) In addition to the consents required pursuant to
Section 6.5, with respect to any Contract or any claim, right or benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, promptly after the date hereof, to
the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, Parent will use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain the written consent of the other parties to
any such Contract for any contemplated assignment thereof to a Purchaser or
to the change in control of any Transferred Subsidiary, or written
confirmation from such parties reasonably satisfactory in form and substance
to Buyer and Parent confirming that such consent is not required; provided,
however, that such commercially reasonable assistance shall not include any
requirement of Parent or its affiliates to expend money, commence any
litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to
any other party.   (c) If such consent, waiver or confirmation is not
obtained with respect to any such Contract the assignment of which is
contemplated herein, as among the parties hereto and their Affiliates, the
intended assignee thereof will obtain from the intended assignor thereof
through a subcontracting arrangement, the purchase of inventory in advance
of    37   the Closing or otherwise, and subject to applicable Law and
the terms of such Contract, the claims, rights and benefits of the intended
assignor thereof and, to the extent possible, the intended assignee will be
responsible for the obligations of the intended assignor under such Contracts
in accordance with this Agreement, and the intended assignor will enforce at
the request of, at the cost of and for the benefit of the intended assignee,
any and all claims and rights against a third party arising from any such
Contract (including the right to elect to terminate such Contract in
accordance with the terms thereof upon the request of the intended
assignee).   6. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO BUYER\'S OBLIGATIONS   Each and
every obligation of Buyer under this Agreement is subject to the satisfaction
(or waiver by Buyer) prior to or at the Closing of each of the following
conditions:   6.1. Accuracy of Representations and Warranties; Performance
of Obligations.   The representations and warranties of Parent made in this
Agreement shall be true and correct as of the date hereof and on and as of
the Closing Date, as though made on and as of the Closing Date, and Parent
shall have performed or complied with all obligations and covenants required
by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by Parent by the time of
the Closing, except (a) for representations and warranties that speak as of a
specific date or time (which need only be true and correct as of such date or
time), (b) for breaches of such representations and warranties and covenants
that, in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and (c) for
breaches that have been cured (including without limitation through the
granting of a post-Closing indemnity for any damages related to such
breaches) and Parent shall have delivered to Buyer a certificate dated the
Closing Date and signed by an officer of Parent in the officer\'s capacity as
such confirming the foregoing to the best of such officer\'s knowledge.  
6.2. No Orders or Actions.   No Order shall have been enforced or issued by
any court of competent jurisdiction or Government Entity and remain in effect
that would, and no action, suit or proceeding shall be pending that, in the
reasonable legal opinion of counsel to the Buyer, would, or be expected to
result in an Order that would, on a temporary or permanent basis: (a)
restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the transactions contemplated hereby;
(b) cause any of the transactions contemplated hereby to be rescinded
following their consummation; or (c) adversely affect the right of the Buyer
and the Purchasers to own the Equity Interests, the Transferred Subsidiaries,
the U.S. Intellectual Property, the Canadian Assets and the Toolz Shares and
to operate the Business.   6.3. HSR Act and Other Approvals.   All
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other
applicable Competition Laws shall have expired or terminated.   6.4.
Guarantee Releases and Indebtedness.   The actions contemplated by Section
4.7 and Section 4.8 shall have been completed.   38    6.5. Licenses,
Etc.   All licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications, orders, registrations and filings listed in Schedule 6.5
shall have been received, issued or made unless the failure of such items to
have been so received, issued or made would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.   7. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO
PARENT\'S OBLIGATIONS   Each and every obligation of Parent under this
Agreement is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver by Parent) prior to or at
the Closing of the following conditions:   7.1. Accuracy of Representations
and Warranties; Performance of Obligations.   The representations and
warranties of Buyer made in this Agreement shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of the date hereof and on and as of the Closing Date, as
though made on and as of the Closing Date, and Buyer shall have performed or
complied with all obligations and covenants required by this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by Buyer by the time of the Closing, except (a)
for representations and warranties that speak as of a specific date or time
(which need only be true and correct as of such date or time) and (b) for
breaches that have been cured; and Buyer shall have delivered to Parent
a certificate dated the Closing Date and signed by an officer of Buyer in
the officer\'s capacity as such confirming the foregoing to the best of
such officer\'s knowledge.   7.2. No Orders or Actions.   No Order shall
have been enforced or issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or
Government Entity and remain in effect that would, and no action, suit or
proceeding shall be pending that, in the reasonable legal opinion of counsel
to Parent, would, or be expected to result in an Order that would, on a
temporary or permanent basis, restrain, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the
transactions contemplated hereby.   7.3. HSR Act and Other Approvals.  
All applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other
applicable Competition Laws shall have expired or terminated.   7.4.

(a) If the Closing occurs and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article 8, Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, and its
directors, officers, employees, affiliates and controlling persons, from and
against all Losses asserted against,    39   resulting to, imposed upon
or incurred by any such person, directly or indirectly, by reason of or
resulting from (i) any breach of any of the representations and warranties of
Parent; (ii) any breach of any covenant of Parent contained in this Agreement
or (iii) any Indemnified Liability. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and its
directors, officers, employees, affiliates and controlling persons, shall not
be entitled to recover Losses under any of clauses (i) or (ii) of this
Section 8.1(a) to the extent Parent has an indemnification obligation under
clause (iii) of this Section 8.1(a).   (b) Parent\'s obligations under
Section 8.1(a) shall be subject to the following limitations:   (i) Except
as provided in clause (ii) and clause (x) of this Section 8.1(b), Parent\'s
obligations under Section 8.1(a)(iii) with respect to Specified Liabilities
shall not be subject to the limitations provided in this Section 8.1(b);  
(ii) Parent\'s liability for Losses arising out of clause (v) of the
definition of Specified Liabilities in Section 11.17 at any of the Subsidiary
Facilities other than the Delta Tupelo Facility ("On-Site Contamination")
shall be limited to 75% of the first $8,000,000 of Losses sustained by the
Indemnified Parties as a result thereof, provided that once such Losses
exceed $8,000,000 Parent shall be liable for 100% of all further Losses and
provided, further, that Parent shall be liable for 100% of all Losses arising
out of any contamination of the soil or ground water at the Delta
Tupelo Facility by Hazardous Substances;   (iii) Parent shall not have any
liability for Losses for any breach of the representations and warranties of
Parent or for any Indemnified Liabilities unless the Loss arising therefrom
exceeds $50,000, provided that for purposes of determining whether the Losses
arising out of a breach of a representation or warranty of Parent or for any
Indemnified Liability exceed $50,000 breaches arising out of a series of
related events shall be aggregated;   (iv) Parent shall not have any
liability for Losses for any breach of the representations and warranties of
Parent or for any Indemnified Liabilities unless and until the aggregate of
all Losses relating thereto for which Parent would, but for this clause (iv),
be required to indemnify Buyer (excluding Losses for which Parent has no
liability as a result of clause (iii) of this Section 8.1(b)) exceeds on a
cumulative basis an amount equal to $5,000,000, at which point Parent,
subject to clause (v) of this Section 8.1(b), shall indemnify Buyer for such
Losses, but only to the extent such Losses exceed $5,000,000;   (v) Parent
shall not have any liability for Losses for any breach of the representations
and warranties of Parent or for Indemnified Liabilities to the extent the
aggregate amount of Losses for which Parent would otherwise be liable exceeds
$100,000,000;   (vi) Parent shall not have any liability for Losses for any
breach of the representations and warranties if Buyer had knowledge of
such breach at the time of the Closing and failed to notify Parent of such
breach in accordance with Section 4.5(b);   (vii) Buyer shall have no right
to indemnification under Section 8.1(a)(i) with respect to any Loss or
alleged Loss if Buyer requested a reduction in the Net Asset  
40   Value reflected on the Closing Statement on account of any matter
forming the basis for such Loss or alleged Loss;   (viii) If a liability or
reserve was reflected on the Final Closing Statement relating to any matter
for which Buyer would otherwise be entitled to indemnification under Section
8.1(a)(i) or Section 8.1(a)(iii), then the calculation of Buyer\'s Losses in
respect of such matter shall be reduced by the full amount of such liability
or reserve as reflected in the calculation of Net Asset Value on the Final
Closing Statement and Buyer shall have no right to indemnification with
respect to the amount of such Loss reflected as a liability or reserve on the
Final Closing Statement;   (ix) The obligations to indemnify and hold Buyer
harmless pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i) shall terminate as set forth in
Section 3.3 and the obligations to indemnify and hold Buyer harmless pursuant
to Section 8.1(a)(iii) shall terminate ten (10) years after the Closing Date,
except that Parent\'s obligations with respect to Specified Liabilities
(other than as provided in clause (x) of this Section 8.1(b)) shall not be
subject to the foregoing limitation; provided, however, that such obligations
to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item
as to which Buyer shall have, prior to the expiration of such ten (10) year
period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice that constitutes an
Indemnification Notice and complies with the requirements therefor; and  
(x) The obligations to indemnify and hold Buyer harmless pursuant to Section
8.1(a)(iii) with respect to Losses arising out of On-Site Contamination shall
terminate ten (10) years after the Closing Date; provided, however, that such
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect
to any Remedial Action with respect to any On-Site Contamination if a plan of
remediation was adopted with respect to such On-Site Contamination prior to
the expiration of such ten (10) year period and Buyer has complied with the
requirements of Section 8.3 and Section 8.4.   8.2. Indemnification By
Buyer.   If the Closing occurs and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Article 8, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent, and
its directors, officers, employees, affiliates and controlling persons, from
and against all Losses asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or
incurred by any such person, directly or indirectly, by reason of or
resulting from (a) the breach of the representations and warranties of Buyer
described in Section 3.2, (b) any breach of any covenant of Buyer contained
in this Agreement or (c) the operation or ownership by Buyer of the business
of the Transferred Subsidiaries following the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the obligations to indemnify and hold Parent harmless pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) shall terminate when the representations and warranties of
Buyer terminate pursuant to Section 3.3; provided, however, that such
obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect
to any items as to which Parent shall have, prior to the expiration of the
applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice that
constitutes an Indemnification Notice and complies with the requirements
therefor.   41    8.3. Procedures Relating to Indemnification Between
Buyer and Parent.   Following the discovery of any facts or conditions which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to a Loss or Losses for which
indemnification under this Article 8 can be obtained, the party seeking
indemnification under this Article 8 (the "Indemnified Party") shall, as
promptly as possible and in no event later than thirty (30) days thereafter,
provide written notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party"), setting forth the specific facts and circumstances, in
reasonable detail, relating to such Loss or Losses, the amount of Loss or
Losses (or a statement to the effect that the amount of Loss or Losses is not
known if the actual amount is not known or not capable of reasonable
calculation) and the specific Section(s) of this Agreement upon which the
party seeking indemnification is relying in seeking such indemnification
("Indemnification Notice"), provided, however, that no delay on the part of
the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to
the extent that) the Indemnifying Party is thereby materially prejudiced.  
8.4. Procedures Relating to Indemnification for Third Party Claims.   (a) If
an Indemnified Party receives notice of a claim or demand made by any other
person, firm, Government Entity or corporation (a "Third Party Claim"), the
Indemnified Party shall provide an Indemnification Notice to the Indemnifying
Party relating to the Third Party Claim as promptly as possible and in no
event later than thirty (30) days after receipt by such Indemnified Party of
notice of the Third Party Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within five (5) business days after the
Indemnified Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party as required by this
Section 8.4(a) shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation
hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party
is thereby materially prejudiced.   (b) Subject to Section 8.4(c), if a
Third Party Claim is made against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if the
Indemnifying Party so chooses and, within ten (10) business days after the
provision of the Indemnification Notice acknowledges in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party therefor, to assume the defense
thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding any acknowledgment
made pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall continue to
be entitled to assert any limitation on its indemnification responsibility
contained in Section 8.1(b). Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, then the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel,
at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying
Party, it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall
control such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the Indemnifying Party    42   has not assumed the defense
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim,
all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such
Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Party\'s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the
Indemnifying Party, within a reasonable time after receipt of
an Indemnification Notice relating to a Third Party Claim, chooses not to
assume defense of a Third Party Claim or fails to defend such Third Party
Claim actively and in good faith, the Indemnified Party will (upon further
notice) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of
such Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to
such Third Party Claim, on behalf of, and for the account and risk of, the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall have no right to
challenge the Indemnified Party\'s defense, compromise, settlement or consent
to judgment.   (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement,
in the case of matters relating to On-Site Contamination, whether or not
such matters constitute a Third Party Claim, the following provisions shall
apply:   (i) Buyer shall be entitled to manage all such matters and Parent
shall have the right to participate (at its own cost and expense). Parent
shall have the right to participate in all decisions regarding any
such matter, including reasonable access to sites where any action relating
to such matter is being conducted, reasonable access to all documents,
correspondence, data, reports or information regarding the matter, reasonable
access to employees and consultants of the Buyer with knowledge of relevant
facts about the matter, the right (with reasonable prior notice to Parent) to
attend all meetings and participate in any telephone or other conferences
with any Government Entity or other third party regarding the matter and the
right to review and comment in advance on all work plans, investigations and
other environmental remediation activities and Buyer shall incorporate all
such reasonable comments of Parent. Neither party shall agree to any
settlement of any such action, suit proceeding or claim without the prior
written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.   (ii) Parent shall not have any liability under
this Agreement with respect to any Losses relating to or arising from
any Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substance for which Buyer seeks indemnity
under Section 8.1 resulting from Buyer or its agents and representatives
conducting investigations, sampling, monitoring or remediation of the
Subsidiary Facilities (a "Remedial Action") unless such Remedial Action (i)
has been initiated prior to the Closing, (ii) is required by Environmental
Laws or any Governmental Entity, (iii) is required by a prospective
purchaser, lender or secured creditor of the Subsidiary Facilities, or (iv)
is a Prudent Remedial Action (as hereinafter defined). A "Prudent Remedial
Action" is a Remedial Action that (A) is undertaken in response to Material
Facts (as hereinafter defined), (B) where Buyer has, prior to commencing the
Remedial Action, requested and obtained Parent\'s consent subject to the
provisions of this Section 8.4(c) and (C) where the scope of the Remedial
Action undertaken is reasonable in relation to the perceived risk. At the
time Buyer requests the consent of Parent pursuant to clause (B) of the
preceding sentence, Buyer shall disclose to Parent all material information
relating to the proposed Remedial Action and the basis for conducting the
Remedial Action. Parent\'s consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; however,    43   (1) the reasonableness of Parent\'s decision
will be determined based solely upon the information disclosed to or known by
Parent at the time such consent is requested; (2) evidence that a Hazardous
Substance may be present shall not result in any presumption that the
Hazardous Substance would reasonably be expected to present a significant
risk to human health or the environment; and (3) the parties recognize that a
determination not to further investigate evidence indicating that a Hazardous
Substance is present may, under some circumstances, be a reasonable
determination. "Material Facts" shall mean material facts that represent
reliable objective evidence indicating that a Hazardous Substance is present
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to present a significant risk
to human health or the environment. Buyer agrees that the facts disclosed in
the Schedules hereto (including documents incorporated by reference therein)
do not represent, in and of themselves, reliable objective evidence
indicating that a Hazardous Substance is present in amounts that
would reasonably be expected to prevent a significant risk to human health or
the environment.   (iii) In addressing any On-Site Contamination,
the parties agree to cooperate to minimize the costs of any investigation
or remediation and nothing in this Agreement shall require actions beyond
the minimum action and efforts required by Environmental Laws. The Parties
agree that deed or use restrictions and institutional controls shall be
implemented when such measures are allowed by Environmental Laws and minimize
the costs of any investigation or remediation.   (iv) Parent shall have no
liability for Losses arising from or related to the use of the Subsidiary
Facilities for other than industrial or commercial uses, which, for purposes
of clarity shall not include any residential uses.   (d) The parties shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate with each other in
connection with the prosecution, defense, settlement or performance of their
agreements in this Article 8. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, as to all matters with respect to which a party controls pursuant
to this Section 8.4, upon such party\'s request, the other party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) assign (to the extent assignable) to the
controlling party (or its designee) all existing contracts with independent
consultants and other advisors relating to such matters, (ii) use its
reasonable best efforts to waive all professional conflicts and take other
reasonable steps necessary to allow any counsel representing the other party
with respect to such matters to represent the controlling party (or its
designee) with respect to such matters, (iii) make available to the
controlling party evidence within the other party\'s control and persons
needed as witnesses employed by the other party or its Affiliates,
as reasonably requested by the controlling party for such prosecution,
defense, settlement or performance and (iv) sign such documents, assign such
rights, and take such actions as the controlling party may reasonably request
attendant to the defense or resolution of the matter.   8.5. Insurance and
Tax Effect.   The obligation of any Indemnifying Party to indemnify the
Indemnified Party against any Loss arising under this Article 8 shall be
reduced (a) by the amount of any insurance proceeds irrevocably received from
third party insurers by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Loss or
the underlying factors with respect thereto under any applicable policy and
(b) to take into    44   account any net Tax benefits receivable by the
Indemnified Party as a result of Loss or the underlying reasons therefor and
taking into account (without duplication) the effect of receiving
indemnification hereunder.   Parent and Buyer agree to treat all
indemnification payments made by Parent pursuant to this Agreement as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for all income Tax purposes and to take no
position contrary thereto in any Tax Return or proceeding before any Taxing
Authority, except as otherwise required by applicable Law or any applicable
Order.   8.6. Exclusive Remedy.   Except for rights expressly provided in
Article 6, Article 7 and Article 10 and remedies available at law or in
equity for the breach of the obligations of the parties under Article 5, the
indemnification provisions of this Article 8 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any and all claims arising out of or relating to
Buyer\'s investigation of the Subsidiaries, this Agreement, the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement or any Contract entered into pursuant hereto
(except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth therein) or the
performance by the parties of its or their terms, and no other remedy shall
be had pursuant to any contract, fraud, misrepresentation or other tort
theory or otherwise by Buyer or Parent and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, attorneys, consultants,
successors and assigns, all such remedies being hereby expressly waived to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. Without limitation, the
procedures set forth in this Article 8 constitute the sole and exclusive
remedy of Buyer and Parent arising out of any breach or claimed breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1 or Section 3.2 made
as of the date of this Agreement relating to events occurring on or prior to
the date hereof that become known to Buyer on or prior to the Closing Date.
In furtherance of the foregoing, except as provided above, Buyer hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it may have against Parent relating to
Buyer\'s investigation of the Subsidiaries, this Agreement, the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement or any Contract entered into pursuant hereto
(except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth therein) or the
performance by the parties of its or their terms arising under or based upon
any Law or otherwise. In addition to the foregoing, the amount of
indemnification obligations of Parent set forth in this Article 8 shall be
the maximum amount of indemnification obligations set forth hereunder and
Buyer shall not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement (or any related
agreements) or any further indemnification rights or claims of any nature
whatsoever, all of which Buyer hereby waives.   9. CLOSING   9.1. Closing

transactions herein contemplated shall have been abandoned pursuant to
Section 10.1, and provided that the conditions to the Closing set forth in
Article 6 and Article 7 are satisfied or waived, the closing with respect to
the transaction (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Foley and
Lardner LLP, 777 East Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at 10:00 A.M.,

may be terminated, and the transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned,
only:   (a) By mutual written agreement of Buyer and Parent;   (b) By
Parent or Buyer in the event that the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before December 31, 2004; provided, however, that either party may extend
such date for a period not to exceed ninety (90) calendar days to the extent
necessary for (i) Parent and Buyer to substantially comply with any request
for additional information made by any Governmental Entity with respect to
compliance with any applicable Competition Law or (ii) any applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act to expire or terminate up to a thirty (30)
day maximum following substantial compliance with a request for
additional information made by any Governmental Entity with respect to
compliance with any applicable Competition Law provided, further, that if a
party seeking termination pursuant to Section 10.1(b) is in breach in any
material respect of any of its representations and warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, then that party may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(b); or   (c) By either party if the
other party is in material breach of any of its covenants or other agreements
hereunder and has failed to cure such breach within ten (10) days following
the giving of notice thereof by the non-breaching party and such breach
materially adversely affects the ability of the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.   10.2. Post-Termination Obligations

to Section 10.1 written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
party and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be

and effect, as modified or supplemented by this Agreement, notwithstanding
the termination of this Agreement.   10.3. No Liabilities in Event of
Permitted Termination.   (a) In the event of any permitted termination of
this Agreement as provided in Section 10.1(a) and Section 10.1(b), this
Agreement shall forthwith become wholly void and of no further force and
effect and there shall be no liability on the part of Buyer or Parent, except
that the respective obligations of Buyer and Parent, as the case may be,
under Sections 4.1, 10.2, 11.1 and 11.8 shall remain in full force and
effect. Termination under Section 10.1(c) shall not preclude any party from
suing the other party for willful breach of this Agreement or impair the
right of any party to compel specific performance by another party of its
obligations under this Agreement.   11. MISCELLANEOUS   11.1.
Publicity.   Parent and Buyer agree that, from the date hereof through the
Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by any party without the prior
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), except (a) as such release or announcement may, in the judgment of
the releasing party, be required by Law or any Rule or regulation of any
United States securities exchange on which the releasing party is listed, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall allow
the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, and (b) that Parent and the Subsidiaries may make
such announcements to their respective employees. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer and Parent may each issue a press release at the time of the
signing of this Agreement and on the Closing Date provided that the party
issuing the release shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment on
such release in advance of such issuance. Parent and Buyer agree to keep the
terms of this Agreement confidential, except to the extent required by
applicable Law or for financial reporting purposes and except that the
parties may disclose such terms to their respective accountants and other
representatives as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of their
respective businesses and to representatives of financial institutions that
provide credit facilities to the parties (so long as such persons agree to
keep the terms of this Agreement confidential).   11.2. Assignment.  
Except as expressly provided herein, the rights and obligations of a
party hereunder may not be assigned, transferred or encumbered without the
prior written consent of the other parties.   11.3. Parties in
Interest.   This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of,
and be enforceable by the respective successors and permitted assigns of the
parties hereto including, in the case of the Buyer, each of the Purchasers.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to confer upon any other person any
right or remedy under or by reason of this Agreement.   48    11.4. Law
Governing Agreement.   This Agreement may not be modified or terminated
orally, and shall be construed and interpreted according to the internal laws
of the State of Delaware, excluding any choice of law rules that may direct
the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.   11.5. Amendment and
Modification.   The parties hereto may amend, modify and supplement this
Agreement in such manner as may be agreed upon in writing among the parties
hereto.   11.6. Waivers.   No waiver by any party of any of the provisions
hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and executed
by the party so waiving. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, no
action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements contained herein, and
in any documents delivered or to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement and
in connection with the Closing hereunder. The waiver by any party hereto of a
breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed
as a waiver of any subsequent breach.   11.7. Notices.   All notices,
requests, demands and other communications hereunder shall be given in
writing and shall be personally delivered; sent by telecopier or facsimile
