 3.3(d) _ JV Property Management Agreement._ In the event that a Joint Venture Property is not purchased by Buyer as a result of the Third Party Partner\'s exercise of its Right of First Refusal or failure to consent to such sale, as the case may be, Baymont Partners will use reasonable efforts to arrange for such nonselling Joint Venture (or successor entity if the Third Party Partners take title in a different entity following the exercise of their Right of First Refusal) either (i) to consent to an assignment of the existing Management Agreement for the applicable Joint Venture Property to Buyer as manager if such Management Agreement contains a remaining term of at least twenty (20) years (including all remaining extension options which may be unilaterally exercised by the manager thereunder in its sole discretion) (each, an " _Assigned JV Property Management Agreement_ ") or (ii) to enter into a new twenty (20) year management agreement with Buyer in the form attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit C_ for the operation of the applicable Joint Venture Property under the trade name selected by Buyer if the remaining term of the existing Management Agreement for the applicable Joint Venture Property is less than twenty (20) years (including all remaining extension options which may be unilaterally exercised by the manager thereunder in its sole discretion) (each, a " _New JV Property Management Agreement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Baymont Partners shall not be required to pay or agree to pay additional unreasonable amounts of money or agree to any new or additional unreasonably unfavorable terms or conditions in order to arrange for such consent to an Assigned JV Property Management Agreement or entry into such New JV Property Management Agreement and (ii) since there is no existing Management Agreement for the Joint Venture Property owned by Willowbrook Motel Limited Partnership, only clause (ii) above shall be applicable to such Joint Venture. If a Joint Venture or successor entity either consents to an Assigned JV Property Management Agreement or enters into a New JV Property Management Agreement with Buyer as set forth above, then Buyer shall pay to the Marcus Entities the JV Property Management Price for the applicable Joint Venture Property. 

  

 3.3(e) _ Cooperation._ If a Joint Venture Property is not purchased by Buyer as a result of the Third Party Partner\'s exercise of its Right of First Refusal or failure to consent to such sale, as the case may be, and such Third Party Partner also does not consent to an Assigned JV Property Management Agreement or a New JV Management Agreement pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_, then the Marcus Entities shall reasonably cooperate in connection with and shall not oppose Buyer\'s efforts to obtain the consent of such Third Party Partner to a franchise agreement for the operation of the applicable Joint Venture Property as a Baymont Hotel on the terms set forth in clause (b) of _Section 3.3(a)(ii)_ including, without limitation, the provisions for penalties, liquidated damages and other such usual and customary remedies in the event of any termination of such franchise agreement by the franchisee prior to the fifth (5th) anniversary thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Marcus Entities shall have no obligation to incur any unreimbursed out-of-pocket costs or agree to any unfavorable terms or conditions in connection with such cooperation. 

  

      

  

  

 3.3(f) _ Definitions._

 3.3(f)(ii) _ "Joint Venture Purchase Price"_ shall, with respect to any Joint Venture, be either (A) if Third Party Partners in a Joint Venture elect to exercise their Right of First Refusal or fail to consent to a sale, as applicable, and consent to an Assigned JV Property Management Agreement or enter into a New JV Property Management Agreement, then the applicable JV Property Management Price, (B) if Third Party Partners in a Joint Venture elect to exercise their Right of First Refusal or fail to consent to a sale, as applicable, but such Joint Venture (or successor entity) does not consent to an Assigned JV Property Management Agreement or enter into a New JV Property Management Agreement, zero, or (C) if Third Party Partners elect not to exercise their Right of First Refusal or consent to the sale, as applicable, and the Joint Venture Property is sold to Buyer, the sum of (i) the applicable JV Asset Price, plus (ii) the applicable JV Property Management Price hereto. 

  

 3.3(f)(iii) _ "Selling Joint Venture"_ shall mean each Joint Venture that sells its Joint Venture Property to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. 

  

  

 3.4 _ Ovations® Liability._ 

  

  

 3.4(a) On or before ten (10) business days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, the Marcus Entities shall in good faith prepare, with the assistance of Buyer, a schedule (the " _Estimated Ovations Schedule_ ") summarizing the estimated accrued liabilities under the Ovations or similar guest rewards program of the Marcus Entities determined in accordance with Marcus GAAP as of such date (the " _Estimated Ovations Amount_ "), together with the assumptions underlying such estimated accrued liabilities. The Estimated Ovations Schedule shall be prepared from the internal financial records of the Marcus Mid-Priced Lodging Businesses. Prior to Closing, the Buyer shall have the right to inspect and object to this schedule and the Marcus Entities shall provide reasonable access to Buyer for the purposes of this inspection. 

  

 3.4(b) As soon as reasonably practical after the Closing Date, the Marcus Entities shall prepare in good faith a schedule (the " _Final Ovations Schedule_ ") setting forth the type of data set forth on the Estimated Ovations Schedule. The Final Ovations Schedule shall be prepared from the internal financial records of the Marcus Mid-Priced Lodging Businesses (as then conducted by Buyer or an Affiliate thereof) and shall be prepared in accordance with Marcus GAAP as of such date and otherwise in a manner entirely consistent with the Estimated Ovations Schedule. The Marcus Entities shall, within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date, deliver the Final Ovations Schedule to the Buyer. The Final Ovations Schedule, and the estimated accrued liabilities under the Ovations or similar guest rewards programs of the Marcus Mid-Priced Lodging Businesses as of the Closing Date reflected thereon and prepared in accordance with the Estimated Ovations Schedule (the " _Final Ovations Amount_ ") shall be binding upon the parties upon approval of such Final Ovations Schedule by Buyer. If Buyer does not believe that the Final Ovations Schedule and the calculation of the Final Ovations Amount stated thereon were prepared and calculated in a manner entirely consistent with the Estimated Ovations Schedule, and Buyer and the Marcus Entities cannot mutually agree on the same, then either the Marcus Entities or Buyer may at any time give notice (an " _Ovations Appraisal Notice_ ") to the other party. Within five (5) business days after an Ovations Appraisal Notice is given, the Marcus Entities and Buyer each shall provide to KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP declines to be so retained, another mutually agreed upon national accounting firm (the " _Ovations Valuation Expert_ "), with a copy to the other party, their opinion (each an " _Ovations Opinion_ ") as to the proper valuation of the Final Ovations Amount, together with such supporting documentation as they may desire to provide. If one party fails to deliver its Ovations Opinion within such five business day period but the other party has timely delivered its 

  

      

  
  

Ovations Opinion, then the Final Ovations Amount shall automatically and
conclusively be deemed to be the amount set forth in the Ovations Opinion so
delivered by such party. If both parties have timely delivered their Ovations
Opinions to the Ovations Valuation Expert, then the Final Ovations Amount
shall be determined "baseball style" such that the Ovations Valuation Expert
must choose, as the Final Ovations Amount, the amount set forth in either the
Marcus Entities\' or Buyer\'s Ovations Opinion, and shall have no right to
make any other determination as to the Final Ovations Amount. The Ovations
Valuation Expert shall choose the Final Ovations Amount set forth in either
the Marcus Entities\' or Buyer\'s Ovations Opinion within five (5) business
days after the delivery of both of the Ovations Opinions, and such
determination shall be final and binding on the Marcus Entities and Buyer,
without any Liability to the Ovations Valuation Expert.

  

 3.4(c) Within three (3) business days following determination of the Final Ovations Amount in accordance with _Section 3.4(b)_, (i) in the event the Final Ovations Amount is less than the Estimated Ovations Amount, Buyer shall pay to the Marcus Entities an amount from the Buyer equal to the difference between such amounts and, (ii) in the event the Final Ovations Amount is greater than the Estimated Ovations Amount, the Marcus Entities shall pay to the Buyer the difference between such amounts, in each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds. 

  

 3.4(d) Nothing in this _Section 3.4_ shall affect the prorations provided for in _Section 12.3_. 

   

 3.4(e) Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 3.4_, the Marcus Entities shall have no post-Closing Liabilities related to the Ovations program. 

  

  

 3.5 _ Allocation of Purchase Price._ Buyer and the Marcus Entities shall cooperate to prepare, to the extent practicable, prior to the Closing Date, a mutually agreed upon allocation of the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Buyer and the Marcus Entities shall endeavor in good faith to agree upon a mutually satisfactory allocation of the Purchase Price, failing which, the matter shall, after Closing, be referred to an independent appraisal or accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the parties for resolution of such dispute. The determination of the independent appraisal or accounting firm shall be binding on both the Buyer and the Marcus Entities. The Marcus Entities and Buyer will follow and use the allocation determined according to this _Section 3.5_ in all Tax Returns, filings or other related reports made by them to any Tax authorities, and neither the Marcus Entities nor Buyer shall file any such Tax returns, filings or other related reports that are inconsistent with such allocation. To the extent that disclosures of this allocation are required to be made by the parties to the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") under the provisions of Section 1060 of the Code, or any regulations thereunder, Buyer and the Marcus Entities will disclose such reports to the other prior to filing with the IRS. The Marcus Entities and Buyer acknowledge and agree that Buyer may, in its discretion and at its sole expense, retain an independent appraisal firm to assist in the preparation of the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets, but that in no event shall such appraised values be deemed to constitute the valuations that will be established pursuant to this _Section 3.5_. Similarly, (i) in no event will the valuations set forth in _Exhibit D_ be deemed to constitute the valuations attributable to the Purchased Assets for purposes of this _Section 3.5_ unless otherwise agreed by the parties, each in their sole discretion and (ii) in no event will the allocation of the Purchase Price under this _Section 3.5_ be deemed to constitute the valuations of the Purchased Assets for any other purpose.

6. EMPLOYEESEMPLOYEE BENEFITS 

  

 6.1 _ Employees; Affected Employees._ 

  

  

 6.1(a) _Schedule 6.1(a)_ hereto contains a list of all Persons who currently provide service to the Marcus Mid-Priced Lodging Businesses, including name, date of hire, position, site of work, status (active or inactive; if inactive, expected date of return), regularly scheduled hours per week, base compensation and current bonus opportunity and identification of whether such Person is an Employee or Contingent Worker. At or prior to the Closing the Marcus Entities shall terminate the employment of all Employees of the Marcus Mid-Priced Lodging Businesses (other than those employed at the Marcus corporate headquarters who will not become Affected Employees) and at Buyer\'s request, shall terminate all service agreements or contracts relating to the services of Contingent Workers in each case who are then actively employed by Marcus Entities and Selling Joint Ventures and shall pay any and all costs related thereto not specifically allocated to Buyer herein (other than to the extent Buyer does not comply with its obligations under _Section 6.1(b))_. Prior to the Closing Date but subject to _Section 6.1(b)_, Buyer may, in its discretion and on such terms as it deems appropriate, offer employment to, and the Marcus Entities shall use their reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in employing as new employees of Buyer (without having to pay additional money or enter into any different or new bonus or incentive arrangements, other than as otherwise specifically contemplated herein), the Employees who are in good standing and actively employed on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, or can reasonably be expected to return to active employment within 180 days following the Closing. Buyer\'s offers of employment to Employees who are actively employed must be accepted not less than one (1) week prior to Closing. Employment for those Employees who accept offers of employment shall commence on the Closing Date or such later date as may be specified by Buyer (the Closing Date and such later dates shall be referred to collectively as the " _Transfer Dates_ "). The Marcus Entities and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to determine their respective employment obligations with respect to Employees who are not actively employed as of the Closing (" _Leave Employees_ "). Subject to their normal policies and practices and in compliance with all applicable Laws, the Marcus Entities shall continue the employment and remain responsible for applicable benefits of all Leave Employees. If a Leave Employee is able to return to work within 180 days of the Closing Date, Buyer shall offer employment to such Leave Employee on terms consistent with this _Section 6_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.1_, Affected Employees (as well as other Employees, Contingent Workers and Leave Employees who, prior to the date of this Agreement, were considered to be employed "at will") shall be (or, in the case of Employees, Contingent Workers and Leave Employees who are not Affected Employees, shall continue to be) considered to be employed "at will" and nothing shall be construed to limit the ability of Buyer, the Marcus Entities or Selling Joint Ventures or any of its Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Affected Employee at any time, whether before or after Closing, for any reason, or to change their terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited to, the levels of compensation and benefits, if any, in effect from and after the Transfer Date. 

  

 6.1(b) _Schedule 6.1(b)_ lists each single site of employment employing a sufficient number of employees that an employer would have advance notice obligations under WARN or similar state or local Laws in the event of a shut down or mass layoff within the Marcus Mid-Priced Lodging Businesses acquired by Buyer. _Schedule 6.1(b)_ sets forth, as of a recent date, for each Employee of 

  

      

  
  

the Marcus Mid-Priced Lodging Businesses who has suffered an "employment
loss" (as defined under WARN) during the 90-day period preceding the date
hereof, including: (A) the name of such Employee, (B) the date of hire of
such Employee, (C) such Employee\'s regularly scheduled hours of employment
over the six month period prior to such "employment loss," and (D) such
Employee\'s last work site, job title, assignment and department. The Marcus
Entities shall, at Closing, update _Schedule 6.1(b)_ as of a recent date.
Buyer shall make offers of employment to a sufficient number of Employees so
that no notices or other obligations under WARN, or under any similar
provision of any state or local Laws will be required or incurred as a result
of the transactions contemplated herein or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_
, that such obligations shall not apply to Employees who work at the Marcus
Entities\' corporate headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The parties
expressly agree that Buyer\'s obligations hereunder apply only with respect to
Employees employed at single sites of employment as listed on _Schedules
6.1(a) _ and _6.1(b)_ and that the Marcus Entities shall retain liability
under WARN or similar state or local Laws, insofar as they later may be
determined to be applicable, for all Employees and all Contingent Workers at
the Marcus Entities\' Milwaukee, Wisconsin corporate headquarters.

  

 6.1(c) Buyer will carry-over and recognize all unused vacation to the extent earned by Affected Employees while employed by the Marcus Entities. Affected Employees may then use such carried over vacation in accordance with Buyer\'s policies and procedures. The Buyer shall receive a credit, as determined in accordance with Marcus GAAP, against the Purchase Price in the amount of all vacation carried over and the Marcus Entities shall, other than the obligations associated with such credit, have no other obligations or Liabilities related to such vacation to the extent so credited. Buyer shall be responsible for all COBRA obligations with respect to Affected Employees and the applicable Marcus Entity shall be responsible for all COBRA obligations with respect to all other Employees. 

  

 6.1(d) Other than as required by Law or any Marcus Employee Plan/Agreement in effect as of the date hereof, all Transaction Stay/Severance Payments shall not include the offer or payment of severance or any type of termination payment to Employees to whom Buyer makes an offer of employment, regardless of whether such offer is accepted, provided that such offer (i) does not require such Employee to relocate and (ii) is for a substantially similar position and for substantially similar compensation. 

  

  

 6.2 _ Payroll Tax._ The Marcus Entities hereby acknowledge that for FICA and FUTA Tax purposes, Buyer or a subsidiary of Buyer qualifies as a successor employer with respect to the Affected Employees. In connection with the foregoing, at Buyer\'s option, the Marcus Entities agree to follow or cause the Selling Joint Ventures to follow the "Alternative Procedures" set forth in Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 96-60. Buyer shall notify the Marcus Entities of its intention to follow the "Alternative Procedures" on or promptly after the Closing Date. If the "Alternative Procedures" are followed, the Marcus Entities and Buyer understand that Buyer shall assume the Marcus Entities\' and the Selling Joint Ventures\' entire obligation to furnish a Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, to the Affected Employees. In addition to all Records and Files relating to the Affected Employees that the Marcus Entities and the Selling Joint Ventures shall deliver to Buyer as of the Closing Date or as otherwise required by this Agreement, the Marcus Entities and the Selling Joint Ventures shall timely provide Buyer with any and all other information (and in such format and media) as it shall reasonably request to properly comply with the requirements in the preceding sentence, which in no event shall be more than ten (10) business days from the date of a written request for such information. 

  

 6.3 _ Employee Benefit Plans._ 

  

  

 6.3(a) As soon as reasonably practicable, following the Closing Date, Buyer may arrange for each Affected Employee participating in any Marcus Employee Plan/Agreement to participate in employee plans of Buyer, in Buyer\'s sole discretion, in accordance with the eligibility criteria 

  

      

  

thereof. If Buyer arranges for participation in such employee plans of Buyer,
then (i) all such participants shall receive full credit for years of service
with a Marcus Entity, Selling Joint Venture or any of its Affiliates (and
service otherwise credited by such Marcus Entity, Selling Joint Venture or
Affiliate) prior to the Closing Date for eligibility and vesting
purposes; (ii) all such participants shall participate in such employee plans
of Buyer on terms no less favorable than those offered by Buyer to similarly
situated employees of Buyer; and (iii) to the extent permitted by the
applicable employee plans of Buyer, Buyer shall cause any and all pre-existing
condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability requirements under any group plans to be waived with respect to
such participants and their eligible dependents to the same extent that such
limitations were waived under the Marcus Employee Plan/Agreement in which
such Affected Employee previously participated and shall provide each
participant with credit for any deductibles paid under an applicable Marcus
Entity or Selling Joint Venture welfare benefit plan prior to the Closing
Date for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out of pocket, or
similar requirements under any health plans in which such participants are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date. As of the Closing, the Marcus
Entities shall fully vest each Affected Employee or shall cause each Affected
Employee to be fully vested in his or her benefits or accounts under any
Marcus Employee Plan/Agreement that is a 401(k) plan (the " _Marcus 401(k)
Plan_ "). The Marcus Entities will cause the Marcus 401(k) Plan to permit
Affected Employees to receive such distributions. Furthermore, the Marcus
Entities shall cause the Marcus 401(k) Plan to be amended to the extent
necessary to permit each Affected Employee who has one or more outstanding
loans under such plan as of Closing to roll over the promissory note(s)
evidencing such loan(s) to the 401(k) plan of Buyer. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Marcus Entities shall have no obligation
to accelerate the vesting of any of the Marcus stock options held by any
Employee and all such options shall cease vesting and terminate in accordance
with their terms on the Transfer Date.

  

 6.3(b) Except as provided in _Section 6.1(c)_, in no event shall Buyer or any of its Affiliates be liable for any benefits incurred or accrued by any Affected Employee under the Employee Plan/Agreements maintained by the Marcus Entities on or prior to the relevant Transfer Date. Except as provided in _Section 6.1(c)_, the Marcus Entities, the Selling Joint Ventures and their respective Affiliates, as applicable, will remain responsible for all benefits payable to any Employees or former Employee with respect to service prior to the applicable Transfer Date and to any Employees under the Employee Plan/Agreements maintained by the Marcus Entities who do not become Affected Employees, including, in each case, the Transaction Stay/Severance Payments. The Marcus Entities, the Selling Joint Ventures and their respective Affiliates, as applicable, shall be responsible for providing any Employee or former Employee whose "qualifying event," within the meaning of Section 4980B(f) of the Code, occurs prior to the Transfer Date (and such Employee\'s or former Employee\'s "qualified beneficiaries" within the meaning of Section 4980B(f)) with continuation of group health coverage required by Section 4980B(f) under the terms of the applicable group health plan maintained by the Marcus Entities, the Selling Joint Ventures and their respective Affiliates, as applicable, and to the extent required by Law. 

   

 6.3(c) The Marcus Entities shall remain solely liable for any unused accrued vacation (except as provided in _Section 6.1(c)_ above), sick or so-called "earned" time with a Marcus Entity, a Selling Joint Venture or any Affiliate thereof, including carryover accrued vacation, sick or so-called "earned" time, salaries and wages, severance or termination payments (including, without limitation, any Transaction Stay/Severance Payments), or any bonus or incentive payments or other forms of compensation or expense reimbursement with a Marcus Entity or any Affiliate thereof with respect to each Employee, including Affected Employees. Subject to _Section 2.1(f)_, the Marcus Entities shall remain solely liable for any worker\'s compensation claims in respect of any injury or illness arising from any act or occurrence that occurs prior to the applicable Transfer Date.

 7.9 _ Adverse Diligence Discoveries._ 

  

  

 7.9(a) _ Definitions; Interpretation._ 

    

 7.9(a)(i) _ Adverse Diligence Discovery._ There shall be deemed to be an " _Adverse Diligence Discovery_ " if Buyer\'s Diligence discloses that any of the representations and warranties of the Marcus Entities (including with respect to the Marcus Entities, their Affiliates and the Selling Joint Ventures) in _Article 4_ of this Agreement is breached; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _Section 7.9(a)_ only, any knowledge qualifications or limitations contained in the representations and warranties of the Marcus Entities (i.e., the words "to the Marcus Entities\' knowledge" or "to the knowledge of the Marcus Entities" and words of similar import) shall be ignored and shall be deemed deleted from such representations and warranties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Adverse Diligence Discovery under this _Section 7.9(a)_ shall exclude the condition of the case goods (including furniture, fixtures and equipment, etc.) and soft goods (including carpeting, bedding and linens, etc.); _provided_ that, except as provided in _Section 11.2_, no other representations, 

   

      

   

warranties, covenants, conditions, rights or other obligations under this
Agreement shall be affected by this exclusion.

  

 7.9(a)(ii) _ Adverse Diligence Discovery Amount._ " _Adverse Diligence Discovery Amount_ " shall mean, with respect to any Property, the sum of (i) with respect to all Adverse Diligence Discoveries that are susceptible to reasonable cure, the aggregate amount of all reasonable costs and expenses to reasonably cure all of such Adverse Diligence Discoveries and (ii) with respect to all Adverse Diligence Discoveries that are not susceptible to reasonable cure, either (x) the aggregate adverse impact on the operational value of such Property, or (y) with respect to Adverse Diligence Discoveries relating to a breach of _Section 4.12(a)_ (but only with respect to Environmental Laws and Hazardous Substances released in violation of any Environmental Law or which release requires any so-called "response action" (which may include remediation) under any Environmental Law or other requirement of any Government Entity) or _Section 4.12(c)_, the value of such Property in each case as determined pursuant to _Section 7.9(d)_. 

   

 7.9(a)(iii) _ Excluded Diligence Amounts._ " _Excluded Diligence Amounts_ " shall mean any Adverse Diligence Discovery Amount related to an Adverse Diligence Discovery resulting from (w) a breach of the Excepted Representations and Warranties; (x) any fraud, intentional misrepresentation or a deliberate or willful breach by the Marcus Entities of any of their representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement; and (y) any failure by Marcus Entities to pay, perform and discharge when due any of the Specifically Identified Excluded Liabilities. 

   

 7.9(a)(iv) _ Reasonable Cure; Reasonably Cured._ When used herein, "reasonable" cure or "reasonably" cure will, as appropriate, allow the Marcus Entities to repair all items or conditions that constituted the Adverse Diligence Discovery and shall not require the Marcus Entities to cure an Advance Due Diligence Discovery based on a "replacement cost" standard or otherwise replace an item except if such replacement would be reasonably necessary to effect such cure. 

    

 7.9(b) _ Notice._ Buyer shall give written notice to the Marcus Entities of any Adverse Diligence Discovery promptly after obtaining knowledge thereof, and, in any event, on or before three (3) business days prior to the scheduled Closing Date. In the event of an Adverse Diligence Discovery during the three (3) business days prior to the scheduled Closing Date, such Adverse Diligence Discovery shall be addressed promptly following the Closing in accordance with this _Section 7.9_. Such written notice shall, to the extent known to Buyer, contain the information otherwise required under _Section 11.5(a)_ for an indemnification claim under _Article 11_. 

  

 7.9(c) _ Right to Cure._ To the extent that an Adverse Diligence Discovery is susceptible to reasonable cure prior to Closing, then, the Marcus Entities may (in their sole discretion) attempt to effect such reasonable cure prior to Closing, and all documented out-of-pocket third party costs incurred in connection with such reasonable cure attempt shall be (i) borne by the party that would be required to bear the impact of such Adverse Diligence Discovery pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ if such Adverse Diligence Discovery were not reasonably cured and (ii) made available to Buyer. In the event that an Adverse Diligence Discovery is not reasonably cured by any efforts of the Marcus Entities prior to Closing, the provisions of this _Section 7.9_ shall apply with respect to such Adverse Diligence Discovery. 

  

 7.9(d) _ Investigation; Dispute Resolution._ 

    

 7.9(d)(i) _ Investigation._ Upon receipt of any notice pursuant to and in compliance with _Section 7.9(b)_, the Marcus Entities shall have three (3) business days to investigate the Adverse Diligence Discovery summarized therein. Buyer shall make available to the Marcus 

   

      

   

Entities and their authorized representatives, the information relied upon by
the Buyer to substantiate all Adverse Diligence Discoveries summarized in any
such notices, as well as any other information bearing thereon reasonably
requested by the Marcus Entities and then available to Buyer.

  

 7.9(d)(ii) _ Mutual Resolution of Disputes._ If and to the extent the Marcus Entities and Buyer do not agree on (a) any Adverse Diligence Discovery Amount, (b) whether any Adverse Diligence Discovery is susceptible to reasonable cure or (c) what is required to reasonably cure an Adverse Diligence Discovery, then the Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel of each of the Marcus Entities and Buyer shall meet in person or telephonically as soon as reasonably practical in order to mutually resolve such disagreement. 

  

 7.9(d)(iii) _ Third Party Resolution of Disputes._ If and to the extent the process summarized in _Section 7.9(d)(ii)_ does not resolve the parties\' disagreement and any Adverse Diligence Discovery has not been reasonably cured on or before Closing by the Marcus Entities, then the following dispute resolution procedures shall apply: 

    

 7.9(d)(iii)(A) _ Adverse Diligence Discoveries Effect Upon Certain Properties._ If an Adverse Diligence Discovery is of a nature that prevents the transfer to Buyer of good title to a Property hereunder in accordance with this Agreement, then the applicable Property shall be excluded from this Agreement and the Purchase Price reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price allocated thereto pursuant to _Exhibit D_, subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 7.9(g) _. Such excluded Property shall either be subject to _Section 14.16_ or, if the parties mutually agree, then the Closing solely with respect to such Property shall be delayed to a mutually agreed upon date. 

  

 7.9(d)(iii)(B) _ Disputes Regarding Adverse Diligence Discoveries._ To the extent that _Section 7.9(d)(iii)(A)_ is inapplicable, either the Marcus Entities or Buyer may initiate the process set forth in this _Section 7.9(d)(iii)(B)_ at any time by giving notice (the " _Appraisal Notice_ ") to the other party. Within five (5) business days after an Appraisal Notice is given, the Marcus Entities and Buyer each shall provide to Horwath Hospitality Investment Advisors, or such other independent valuation expert mutually agreed to by the parties (the " _Valuation Expert_ "), with a copy to the other party, its opinion (each an " _Adverse Impact Opinion_ ") as to the Adverse Diligence Discovery Amount (the " _Adverse Diligence Discovery Value Impact_ "), together with such supporting documentation as they may desire to provide. If one party fails to deliver its Adverse Impact Opinion within such five (5) business day period but the other party has timely delivered its Adverse Impact Opinion, then the Adverse Diligence Discovery Value Impact shall automatically and conclusively be deemed to be the amount set forth in the Adverse Impact Opinion so delivered by such party. If both parties have timely delivered their Adverse Impact Opinions to the Valuation Expert, then the Adverse Diligence Discovery Value Impact shall be determined "baseball style" such that the Valuation Expert must choose as the Adverse Diligence Discovery Value Impact the amount set forth in either the Marcus Entities\' or Buyer\'s Adverse Impact Opinion, and shall have no right to make any other determination as to the Adverse Diligence Discovery Value Impact. The Valuation Expert shall choose the Adverse Diligence Discovery Value Impact set forth in either the Marcus Entities\' or Buyer\'s Adverse Impact Opinion within five (5) Business Days after the delivery of both of the Adverse Impact Opinions, and such determination shall be final and binding on the Marcus Entities and Buyer, without any Liability to the Valuation Expert. 

    

      

    
    

 7.9(e) _ Purchase Price Adjustment._ 

    

 7.9(e)(i) _ Non-Excluded Diligence Amounts._ If the Adverse Diligence Discovery Amount (excluding Excluded Diligence Amounts) is: 

     

 7.9(e)(i)(A) less than or equal to Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) (such amount is the " _Adverse Diligence Discovery Deductible_ "), then the Marcus Entities and Buyer shall proceed to Closing and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by (A) $0 _plus_ (B) the aggregate Excluded Diligence Amounts; 

  

 7.9(e)(i)(B) more than the Adverse Diligence Discovery Deductible but less than or equal to Forty-Four Million Dollars ($44,000,000) (the " _Adverse Diligence Discovery Cap_ "), then the Marcus Entities and Buyer shall proceed to Closing, except that the Purchase Price shall be reduced by (A) the amount by which the Adverse Diligence Discovery Amount exceeds the Adverse Diligence Discovery Deductible _plus_ (B) the aggregate Excluded Diligence Amounts; or 

  

 7.9(e)(i)(C) exceeds the Adverse Diligence Discovery Cap, then Buyer may, within five (5) days after it is determined that the Adverse Diligence Discovery Amount (excluding Excluded Diligence Amounts) exceeds the Adverse Diligence Discovery Cap pursuant to this _Section 7.9_, send to the Marcus Entities notice of its election to proceed to Closing, in which case the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of (A) Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000) _plus_  (B) the aggregate Excluded Diligence Amounts. If no such notice is sent by such deadline, or if Buyer otherwise declines to make such election, then this Agreement may be terminated by either Buyer or the Marcus Entities in its entirety, in which event the Escrow Company will return the Earnest Money Deposit to Buyer, whereupon this Agreement shall terminate and the parties shall have no further obligations or liabilities under this Agreement except those that expressly survive termination of this Agreement. 

     

 7.9(e)(ii) _ Excluded Diligence Amount Deductible and Cap._ The Marcus Entities shall be fully liable for all Excluded Diligence Amounts; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the aggregate Excluded Diligence Amounts equal or exceed the cash Purchase Price, then the Marcus Entities may terminate this Agreement, in which event the Escrow Company will return the Earnest Money Deposit to Buyer, whereupon this Agreement shall terminate and the parties shall have no further obligations or liabilities under this Agreement except those that expressly survive termination of this Agreement. 

    

 7.9(f) _ Exclusion of Properties._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but subject to the Marcus Entities\' right to reasonably cure under _Section 7.9(c)_), in addition to the foregoing rights and remedies, if the aggregate Adverse Diligence Discovery Amount with respect to any Property resulting from Adverse Diligence Discoveries with respect to the representations and warranties of the Marcus Entities in _Section 4.12(a) _ (but only with respect to Environmental Laws and Hazardous Substances released in violation of Environmental Law or which release requires any so-called "response action" (which may include remediation) under any Environmental Law or other requirement of any Government Entity is required to be remediated pursuant to any Environmental Law), _Section 4.12(c)_ or _Section 4.13_ (with respect to the first sentence only) exceeds 17.5% of the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the applicable Property pursuant to _Exhibit D_, then at Buyer\'s request such Property shall be excluded from this Agreement and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the portion of the Purchase Price allocated thereto pursuant to _Exhibit D_ subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 7.9(g)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section 7.9(f)_ only, any knowledge, materiality (including any material adverse effect) and/or similar qualifications or limitations contained in the representations 

  

      

  

and warranties of the Marcus Entities in _Sections 4.12(a)_ , _4.12(c)_ and
_4.13_ (with respect to the first sentence only) shall be ignored and shall
be deemed deleted from each such representation and warranty. All
such Excluded Properties excluded pursuant to this _Section 7.9(f)_ shall
either be subject to _Section 14.16_ or, if the parties mutually agree, then
the Closing solely with respect to such Property shall be delayed to a
mutually agreed upon date.

  

 7.9(g) _ Right to Terminate._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if more than nine (9) Properties (or such other higher number mutually agreed upon by Buyer and the Marcus Entities) are excluded from this Agreement or the Purchase Price is to be reduced by more than Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000) (excluding Purchase Price reductions due to Excluded Diligence Amounts) pursuant to this _Article 7_ and/or _Article 10_, then either the Marcus Entities or Buyer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in its entirety by giving written notice to such effect to the other party, in which event the Escrow Company will return the Earnest Money Deposit to Buyer, whereupon this Agreement shall terminate and the parties shall have no further obligations or liabilities under this Agreement except those that expressly survive termination of this Agreement. 

  

  

 7.10 _ Meeting With Franchisees._ After the parties publicly announce the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Marcus Entities will cooperate with Buyer in arranging, at Buyer\'s sole cost, regional, local and one-on-one meetings with each of the Franchisees (including the Franchisee of the Baymont Hotel located in Decatur, Illinois). The Marcus Entities shall have the right, but not the obligation, to send at least one senior executive of Baymont Franchises or Baymont Hotels to each meeting. 

  

 7.11 _ Liquor License; Other Licenses and Permits._ Subject to _Section 1.3_, as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall complete, execute and file with the applicable liquor licensing authority all necessary applications for transfer of all liquor licenses, each of which are listed on _Schedule 7.11_ (each a " _Liquor License_ ") held by any of the Marcus Entities for the service or provision of alcoholic beverages at any of the Properties or the issuance of a new Liquor License to Buyer. Buyer specifically acknowledges and agrees that the transfer of the Liquor License to Buyer on the Closing Date shall not be a condition to Buyer\'s obligation to close the transaction contemplated under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the parties are unable to cause the transfer of the existing Liquor Licenses to Buyer or its designee on the Closing Date or to cause the issuance of a new Liquor License to Buyer or its designee as of the Closing Date, then the Marcus Entities and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in good faith to implement arrangements whereby the appropriate license holding Marcus Entities shall manage the purchase, sale and service of alcoholic beverages at the Properties where liquor is currently being served on behalf of Buyer or its designee following the Closing Date pending the transfer of the existing Liquor Licenses to Buyer or its designee or the issuance of new Liquor Licenses to Buyer or its designee; _provided_ , _however_ , that such arrangements shall comply with customary practices utilized on hotel purchase and sale transactions in the jurisdictions in which the Properties are located and applicable Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, such arrangements may include entering into an Interim Beverage Services Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_, which form shall be modified as mutually and reasonably agreed by the parties to reflect custom and practice in each applicable jurisdiction. Buyer and the Marcus Entities shall use reasonable efforts to effect the transfer of all Licenses and Permits to Buyer (other than Licenses and Permits that are not transferable under applicable Law) and to enable Buyer to obtain new Licenses and Permits to replace any nontransferable License and Permits. 

  

 7.12 _ Integration and Interface Development._ From the date hereof until the Closing, the parties shall cooperate and use reasonable efforts to effect an efficient integration of the Marcus Mid-Priced Lodging Businesses into Buyer\'s operations. Such cooperation and efforts shall include, without limitation, reasonable efforts to cooperate with respect to (i) the exchange of human resources related information (including information to facilitate the extension by Buyer of offers of employment to 

        
  

certain Employees); (ii) the training of Affected Employees; (iii) the
implementation of the workplan attached hereto as _Exhibit F_, as the same
may be amended or supplemented by the mutual agreement of the parties prior to
the Closing to facilitate the integration and interface development; and (iv)
the development or modification of interfaces between the relevant
information technology systems of the Marcus Mid-Priced Lodging Businesses and
such systems of Buyer (including, without limitation, the installation of
software, communication links, hardware and other systems and source codes).
Nothing in this _Section 7.12_ shall require the Marcus Entities or other
Selling Joint Ventures to pay any of their Employees overtime or pay or agree
to pay additional unreasonable amounts of money or agree to any new or
additional unreasonably unfavorable terms or conditions.

  

 7.13 _ Letters of Credit._ To the extent that there are letters of credit supporting the obligations of other parties to any of the Assigned Contracts and subject to _Section 1.3_, the Marcus Entities shall use reasonable efforts to deliver one of the following for each such letter of credit: (i) if such letter of credit is, by its terms, assignable, such letter of credit together with a duly executed assignment of such letter of credit which cites Buyer as the beneficiary thereof or (ii), if such letter of credit is not, by its terms, assignable to Buyer, such letter of credit together with a commitment in form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer by the bank issuing such letter of credit to reissue such letter of credit with Buyer as the beneficiary thereof upon surrender of the outstanding letter of credit, in which case the Marcus Entities agree to surrender such letter of credit at Closing. Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to assist the Marcus Entities in obtaining any such replacement letters of credit including, without limitation, exercising Buyer\'s rights and remedies under the applicable Assigned Contract in order to cause the Assigned Contract counterparty to obtain any replacement letter of credit. 

  

 7.14 _ Subdivision Properties._ Buyer and the Marcus Entities hereby acknowledge that the Baymont Hotels and Woodfield Hotels located on the Real Property described in _Schedule 7.14_ hereto (individually, a " _Subdivision Property_ ," and collectively, the " _Subdivision Properties_ ") are not legally divided parcels of land such that the Baymont Hotel facility or Woodfield Hotel facility, as applicable, is legally separate from the immediately adjacent land and/or land and improvements. 

  

  

 7.14(a) _ Boundaries of Parcels._ Prior to Closing, Buyer and the Marcus Entities shall mutually agree upon the boundaries of the portion of each Subdivision Property (including the land and improvements thereon) to be conveyed to Buyer (individually, a " _Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel_ ", and collectively, the " _Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcels_ "), and that portion (including the land and improvements thereon) to be retained by the applicable Marcus Entity (individually, a " _Retained Subdivision Parcel_ ", and collectively, the " _Retained Subdivision Parcels_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that all improvements comprising each Baymont Hotel facility or Woodfield Hotel facility, as applicable, and all related parking spaces required by local zoning ordinances and otherwise used in the operation of the Baymont Hotel facility or Woodfield Hotel facility, as appropriate, consistent with past practice, shall be included within the boundaries of each Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel, and each Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel shall comply with all zoning Laws, subdivision Laws and other Laws applicable thereto. In addition, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree that each Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel shall abut directly on a public way, with curb cuts that comply with all Laws, or shall have direct access to a public way pursuant to a valid easement of record reasonably acceptable to Buyer, which easement shall be included as an insured parcel in the title insurance policy issued pursuant to _Section 8.10_ hereof. The boundaries of each Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel shall also be sufficient: (i) to permit the Escrow Company to issue to Buyer the title insurance policy required under _Section 8.10_ hereof including, to the extent available in such jurisdiction under applicable Laws, a zoning 3.1 endorsement with parking, and an access endorsement insuring access, either directly or through an insured easement, to a public way, or to the extent such endorsements are not available in such jurisdictions, written confirmation from the applicable municipal zoning administrator/land use planning department confirming that such Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel complies with all applicable 

  

      

  

zoning and land division ordinances; and (ii) for the surveyor to issue an
updated ALTA/ACSM survey of the Subdivision Property showing such subdivision.
Any reciprocal easement agreements, shared parking agreements or similar
easements or agreements affecting any Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel and entered
into in connection with such land division shall be subject to the reasonable
mutual approval of the Marcus Entities and Buyer.

  

 7.14(b) _ Land Division Process._ The Marcus Entities shall commence, and shall use reasonable best efforts to pursue to completion at their sole cost and expense, the land division of each Subdivision Property in accordance with the mutually agreed-upon plans and boundaries, and otherwise in accordance with all Laws applicable to each Subdivision Property. Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate, at no cost to Buyer, with the Marcus Entities in obtaining all necessary approvals of the land division and conveyance of the Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcels to Buyer. 

   

 7.14(c) _ Treatment of Subdivision Properties at Closing._ At Closing, to the extent any Subdivision Properties have not then been legally divided in accordance with the requirements of this _Section 7.14_, Buyer or an Affiliate, as tenant, and the applicable Marcus Entity, as landlord, shall enter into a lease agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_, providing for annual rent of One Dollar ($1.00), pursuant to which Buyer or an Affiliate shall lease from the applicable Marcus Entity, and the applicable Marcus Entity shall lease to Buyer, Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel including all improvements thereon, and all Owned Personal Property, Inventory and Computer Software, and the Marcus Entities shall deliver to Buyer the applicable documents set forth in _Section 12.1_ and all related Contracts, Personal Property Leases, Records and Files, Licenses and Permits, Warranties and future Bookings and other intangible rights and assets, each to the extent the same would be transferred to Buyer if such Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel would be a Property conveyed to Buyer on the Closing Date, located at or used in connection with the operation of the applicable Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel until such time as the land division is approved by all applicable Government Entities and otherwise meets the requirements of this _Section 7.14_, and Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel may be legally conveyed to Buyer, or such lease is terminated as provided in _Section 7.14(e)_. To the extent such items cannot be leased or conveyed to Buyer, as applicable, the Marcus Entities shall also take such efforts as would be required by _Section 1.3_ as if such Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel were a Property. At Closing, Buyer shall deposit into escrow with the Escrow Company the portion of the Purchase Price (net of all prorations required hereunder) allocated to each Subdivision Property pursuant to _Exhibit D_, that has not then been legally divided and approved by all applicable Government Entities and otherwise satisfies the requirements of this _Section 7.14_, which portion of the Purchase Price shall be held by the Escrow Company, in escrow, pending final approval of the land division and the satisfaction of the other requirements of this _Section 7.14_ with respect to such Subdivision Property, and conveyance of such Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel to Buyer, or the return of such funds to Buyer as provided in _Section 7.14(e)_. 

  

 7.14(d) _ Conveyance Upon Receipt of Approvals._ Promptly after receiving all necessary approvals from all applicable Government Entities, and the satisfaction of the other requirements in this _Section 7.14_, relative to each Subdivision Property: (i) Buyer and the Marcus Entities shall jointly instruct the Escrow Company to release to the Marcus Entities such portion of the Purchase Price, along with all interest thereon (which shall be reported as income of the Marcus Entities), allocated to the Subdivision Property for which all necessary approvals have been obtained, and (ii) the Marcus Entities shall deliver to Buyer a deed and a bill of sale, in the forms required under this Agreement, together with such tax declaration forms as may be required by applicable Laws, conveying or assigning, as appropriate, to Buyer Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel and the other property leased by Buyer or an Affiliate relative to such Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel pursuant to _Section 7.14(c)_, as well as the title company affidavits required under _Section 12.1(x)_ and other ancillary documents provided for in _Section 12.1_ to the extent applicable. 

  

      

  

  

 7.14(e) _ Failure to Obtain Approvals._ At any time upon the written agreement of Buyer and the Marcus Entities, or in the event the Marcus Entities are unable to obtain, on or before the Termination Date (as defined in _Exhibit G_), approval of all applicable Government Entities of the land division of any Subdivision Property in accordance with the terms and requirements of this _Section 7.14_ relative to such Subdivision Property, then at Buyer\'s election, either: 

     

 7.14(e)(i) the applicable Subdivision Property shall be excluded from this Agreement, and the Marcus Entities and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Company to release to Buyer such portion of the Purchase Price allocated to such Subdivision Property, including all interest thereon (but minus any outstanding amounts due to the applicable Marcus Entity under the terms of the lease between the applicable Marcus Entity and Buyer (or its Affiliate)), and adjusted for the reproration of the items provided in _Section 12.3_ hereof as of the time of the termination of the applicable lease and the transfer of possession back to the applicable Marcus Entity), and such excluded Subdivision Property shall be an Excluded Property subject to _Section 14.16_, the lease with respect thereto shall be automatically terminated, and all related Contracts, Personal Property Leases, Records and Files, Licenses and Permits, Warranties and future Bookings and other intangible rights and assets shall be assigned back to and be assumed by the Marcus Entities; or 

  

 7.14(e)(ii) the Marcus Entities shall: (a) sell the building and other real property improvements located on the applicable Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel and the associated Owned Personal Property, Inventory, and Computer Software and, to the extent not previously assigned to Buyer, shall assign to Buyer all Contracts, Personal Property Leases, Records and Files, Licenses and Permits, Warranties, Bookings and other general intangible rights and assets used in connection with the ownership or operation of the applicable Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel, in each case pursuant to the documents and procedures set forth in _Sections 12.1_ and _12.2_ , for an aggregate purchase price equal to the component of the Purchase Price allocated to such Subdivision Property in _Exhibit D_ times a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount allocated to such building and other real property improvements, and to the associated Owned Personal Property and the other aforementioned items, each to the extent not previously conveyed to Buyer pursuant to _Section 3.5_, and the denominator of which is the total amount ( _i.e._ , land, improvements and associated Owned Personal Property) allocated to such Subdivision Property pursuant to Section 3.5, and (b) enter into a ninety-nine (99) year "financeable" ground lease with Buyer for Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel upon the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section 7.14(e)(ii)_, and upon such other terms and conditions as may be mutually and reasonably agreed upon by the applicable Marcus Entity and Buyer. In no event would the Marcus Entities be required to subordinate their fee interest in Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel subject to such ground lease to any mortgage or deed of trust financing of Buyer. Any such ground lease shall be sufficient for Buyer to obtain a leasehold title insurance policy insuring such leasehold interest consistent with the provisions of _Section 8.10_ hereof, and otherwise reasonably satisfactory to both parties thereto, and shall provide for rent which, if paid over the term of such ground lease, would provide the Marcus Entities with total rent, discounted to present value using a discount rate of 6.5%, equal to the component of the Purchase Price allocated to such Subdivision Property in _Exhibit D_ times a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount allocated to the land portion of such Subdivision Property pursuant to _Section 3.5_ and the denominator of which is the total amount ( _i.e_ land, improvements and associated Owned Personal Property) allocated to such Subdivision Property pursuant to _Section 3.5_. If the parties cannot agree on any of the terms of such "financeable" ground lease, then, at

 7.14(f) _ Marcus Entities Representations and Warranties._ Notwithstanding that Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcels may be leased to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 7.14_, Buyer shall have the right to bring claims for breaches of the representations and warranties and covenants of the Marcus Entities pursuant to _Article 11_ hereof as if Buyer had purchased Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcels at Closing, and such claims shall be subject to all of the provisions of _Article 11_ of this Agreement as if Buyer had purchased Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcels; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that with respect to any claims for breaches of any representations and warranties and covenants of the Marcus Entities contained herein that apply solely to the physical condition of or compliance with laws of a specific Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel, the Marcus Entities shall have no obligation to make any indemnification for any Losses relating thereto, and such claims shall be ignored for purposes of determining whether the Deductible and Indemnification Cap have been met, unless Buyer shall have, prior to undertaking any work or incurring any cost to effectuate a cure of such breach, notified the Marcus Entities in writing of such breach and provided the Marcus Entities with the opportunity to cure the same, and the Marcus Entities fail to cure the same as provided in this Section. Upon receipt of Buyer\'s written notice of such breach, the Marcus Entities shall have the option to undertake and perform such work or take such actions, at the sole expense of the Marcus Entities, as may be necessary to effect a reasonable cure; provided that: (i) Buyer shall have the right to approve, in its reasonable discretion, the scope of work proposed by the Marcus Entities, and (ii) the Marcus Entities shall promptly commence, and diligently prosecute to completion, the work set forth in the scope of work approved by Buyer. In the event the Marcus Entities take no action to propose a scope of work or commence action to cure the breach within thirty (30) days after Buyer delivers to the Marcus Entities written notice of the same, Buyer may undertake such work, and/or incur such costs, as deemed reasonably necessary by Buyer to cure the same. In such case, Buyer shall have the right to bring a claim for the breach of the representations and warranties and covenants of the Marcus Entities pursuant to _Article 11_ hereof as if Buyer had purchased the applicable Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel at Closing, and such claim shall be subject to all of the provisions of _Article 11_ of this Agreement as if Buyer had purchased the applicable Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel at Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, to the extent that any claim by Buyer for breaches of any representations and warranties or covenants of the Marcus Entities apply solely to defects in the physical condition of or the noncompliance with Laws of the improvements on a specific Buyer\'s Subdivision Parcel, and the consequence of such breach results in an emergency situation that requires immediate repairs to the applicable building or other improvements in order to avoid imminent injury to persons or further damage to property, then Buyer shall have the right to institute such emergency repairs immediately as long as it promptly provides notice to the Marcus Entities thereof.

Such limitations on use of the Use Restricted Properties shall automatically terminate as of the fifteenth (15th) anniversary of the Closing Date. Buyer also acknowledges and agrees that the Marcus Entities shall execute and deliver to Buyer, at Closing, a recordable restrictive covenant to such effect in form reasonably acceptable to Buyer. Buyer from time to time after the Closing Date, at the request of the Marcus Entities shall execute and deliver further instruments, and take such other actions, consistent with this provision to evidence Buyer\'s agreement hereunder.

Closing shall be postponed until the date which is five (5) Business Days
after the expiration of such ten (10) day election period. If the Marcus
Entities and the Buyer are unable to agree on the loss in value (if
applicable) as provided herein within ten (10) Business Days after Buyer\'s
receipt of the Marcus Entities\' written notice of such Condemnation, the
determination of such loss in value shall be made pursuant to the dispute
resolution process described in _Section 7.9(d)(ii)_ and _7.9(d)(iii)_.

  

 10.2(b) _ Non-Material Condemnation._ In the event of any Condemnation other than a Material Condemnation, Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement, but shall proceed to Closing, in which case the Marcus Entities shall assign to Buyer all of the Marcus Entities\' right, title and interest in all claims, proceeds and awards from such Condemnation.

third party, the Indemnified Party reasonably expects to incur Liabilities,
including those as a result of claims, as a result of a breach of such
representation or warranty (an " _Expected Claim Notice_ ") that includes the
information required by, and otherwise complies with, _Section 11.5(a)_,
then such representation or warranty shall survive until, but only for

The Marcus Entities\' indemnification obligations under _Section 11.2_. shall be limited to the amount (the " _Indemnification Cap_ "), if any, equal to (a) Forty Million Dollars ($40,000,000) less (b) any Adverse Diligence Discovery Amount actually borne by the Marcus Entities (either due to a Purchase Price adjustment on account of Adverse Diligence Discoveries except for a purchase price adjustment as a result of a Property becoming an Excluded Property or because the Marcus Entities bear the cost of any reasonable cure) pursuant to the provisions of _Section 7.9_ (excluding Excluded Diligence Amounts).

All claims for indemnification hereunder against any Indemnifying Party shall be reduced to take into account any net cash Tax benefits receivable by the Indemnified Party as a result of such claim or the underlying reasons therefor. 

  

  

 11.7 _ Exclusivity of Indemnification._ Except with respect to breaches of representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement involving fraud, intentional misrepresentation or a deliberate or willful breach, indemnification under this _Article 11_ shall be the exclusive means of recovery (except with respect to any equitable remedy sought by any party) by either party against the other for any breach or violation, or alleged breach or violation, of the representations, warranties and covenants under this Agreement after the Closing Date and shall be in lieu of any other common law or statutory rights or remedies.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Marcus Entities may sell any or all of the Excluded Properties at any time either before or after Closing and nothing herein shall prohibit the Marcus Entities to take the actions that they believe are 

        
  

necessary and appropriate to sell such Excluded Properties provided that (i)
such actions and sales do not prevent the Marcus Entities from transferring to
Buyer good title to the Properties hereunder in accordance with this
Agreement and (ii) if the transferee will be a franchisee of Buyer, the
transferee must enter into a new franchise agreement with Buyer and shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of Buyer as a franchisee. If an Excluded
Property will not be subject to a franchise agreement with Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer, then the Marcus Entities shall, in the case of an
Excluded Property owned by a Marcus Entity, cause the removal of all signage
and other property bearing any of the Marcus Trade Rights and otherwise to
decommission such Excluded Property as a Baymont Hotel or Woodfield Hotel, as
applicable, and, in the case of an Excluded Property owned by a non-Selling
Joint Venture, shall exercise its rights under any management agreement
or franchise agreement and otherwise use reasonable efforts to cause such
decommissioning, in each case at no cost to Buyer.

statements were made or other financial projections or estimates furnished
to it by or on behalf of Marcus or the Marcus Entities as to future
profitability of the Marcus Mid-Priced Lodging Businesses that have been
relied upon by, or represented in that Agreement to, the Buyer.
