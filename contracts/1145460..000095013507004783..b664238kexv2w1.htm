filed by Parent with the SEC and (if and to the extent such forms, reports and documents are not
available on EDGAR) has made available to the Company such forms, reports and documents in the form
filed with the SEC. All such required forms, reports and documents (including those that Parent
may file subsequent to the date hereof) are referred to herein as the &#147;<B><I>Parent SEC Reports</I></B>.&#148; As of
their respective dates, the Parent SEC Reports (i)&nbsp;were prepared in accordance with the

regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent SEC Reports, and
(ii)&nbsp;did not at the time they were filed (or if subsequently amended or superseded by a filing
prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such subsequent filing) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. None of Parent&#146;s subsidiaries is required to file any forms,

does not expect to be material, individually or in the aggregate. The balance sheet of Parent
contained in Parent SEC Reports as of March&nbsp;31, 2007 is hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<B><I>Parent
