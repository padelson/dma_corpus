and all applicable Laws. KML agrees to promptly correct any information (other
than the Pembina Information) in the KML Proxy Circular which shall have
become false or misleading at any time prior to the KML Shareholders Meeting.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, KML shall ensure that the
KML Proxy Circular provides KML Shareholders with information in sufficient
detail to permit them to form a reasoned judgment concerning the matters to

 



     

 

 



 

be placed before them at the KML Shareholders Meeting, including (a) the
unanimous recommendation of the KML Board that the KML Shareholders vote in
favour of the Arrangement Resolution, and (b) a copy of the BMO Nesbitt Burns
Opinion.

 



 

 **2.4** **_Interim Order_**

 



 

The application referred to in Section 2.3(a) shall request that the Interim

the Arrangement and the KML Shareholders Meeting and for the manner in which
such notice is to be provided;

 



 

(b) that the requisite approval for the Arrangement Resolution to be placed
before the KML Shareholders shall be (i) 66 2/3% of the votes cast on the

one vote for each KML Voting Share held and all KML Shareholders shall vote
together as a single class), and (ii) a majority of the votes cast on the
Arrangement Resolution by holders of KML Restricted Voting Shares present in
person or by proxy at the KML Shareholders Meeting after excluding the votes
of those Persons whose votes are required to be excluded under MI 61-101;

 



 

(c) that, in all other material respects, the terms, restrictions and

application to the Court for the Final Order;

 



 

(h) in the application referred to in Section 2.3(a), KML shall inform the
Court that the Parties intend to rely on the exemption provided by Section
3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act for the issuance of the Pembina Common
Shares pursuant to the Arrangement and that, in connection therewith, the
Court will be required to approve the substantive and procedural fairness of
the terms and conditions of the Arrangement to each Person to whom Pembina
Common Shares will be issued. Each Person to whom Pembina Common Shares will
be issued on completion of the Arrangement will be given adequate notice
advising them of their right to attend and appear before the Court at the
hearing of the Court for the Final Order and providing them with adequate
information to enable such Person to exercise such right; and

 



 

(i) for such other matters as the Parties may agree in writing, each acting
reasonably.

 



 

 **2.5** **_Conduct of KML Shareholders  Meeting_**

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Interim Order, KML agrees
to convene and conduct the KML Shareholders Meeting in accordance with its
constating

 



     

 

 



 

documents and applicable Laws and the Interim Order, and agrees not to propose
to adjourn or postpone the meeting without the prior consent of Pembina,
acting reasonably:

 



 

(i) except as required for quorum purposes (in which case the meeting shall be
adjourned and not cancelled) or by applicable Law or by a Governmental Entity;

 



 

(ii) except as permitted under Section 6.4 or Section 7.1(c); or

(b) Notwithstanding the receipt by KML of a Superior Proposal in accordance
with Section 7.1, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Pembina or this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms or except as required by
applicable Law or by a Governmental Entity, KML shall continue to take all
steps reasonably necessary to hold the KML Shareholders Meeting and to cause
the Arrangement Resolution to be voted on at the KML Shareholders Meeting and
shall not propose to adjourn or postpone the KML Shareholders Meeting other
than as contemplated by Section 2.5(a).

 



 

(c) KML shall advise Pembina as reasonably requested, and on a daily basis on
each of the last seven business days prior to the date of the KML
Shareholders Meeting, as to the aggregate tally of the proxies and votes
received in respect of such meeting and all matters to be considered at such
meeting.

 



 

(d) KML shall advise Pembina of any written communication received after the
date of this Agreement from any securityholder of KML or other Person in
opposition to the Arrangement Resolution or any written notice of dissent,
purported dissent exercise or withdrawal of Dissent Rights by a holder of KML

KML to any such holder exercising or purporting to exercise Dissent Rights.

 



 

(e) KML shall not make any payment or settlement offer, or agree to any
payment or settlement prior to the Effective Time with respect to the Dissent
Rights without the prior written consent of Pembina, acting reasonably.

 



 

 **2.6** **_Court Proceedings_**

 



 

KML will provide Pembina and its legal counsel with reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon drafts of all material to be filed with the Court in
connection with the Arrangement, including by providing on a timely basis a
description of any information required to be supplied by Pembina for
inclusion in such material, prior to the service and filing of that material,
and will accept the reasonable comments of Pembina and its legal counsel with
respect to any such information required to be supplied by Pembina and
included in such material and any other matters contained therein. KML will
ensure that all material filed with the Court in connection with the
Arrangement is consistent in all material respects with the terms of this
Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement. In addition, KML will not object to
legal counsel to Pembina making submissions on the application for the Interim
Order and the application for the Final Order as such counsel considers
appropriate, provided such submissions are consistent with this Agreement and
the Plan of Arrangement. KML will also provide legal counsel to Pembina on a
timely basis with copies of any notice and evidence served on KML or its legal
counsel in respect of the application for the Interim Order or Final Order or
any appeal therefrom. Subject to applicable Laws, KML will not file any
material with, or make any submissions to, the Court in connection with the
Arrangement or serve any such material, and will not agree to modify or amend
materials so filed or served, except as contemplated hereby or with Pembinas
prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; provided that nothing herein shall require Pembina to agree or
consent to any increased purchase price or other consideration or other
modification or amendment to such filed or served materials that expands or
increases Pembinas

 



      

 

 



 

obligations set forth in any such filed or served materials or under this
Agreement. KML shall oppose any proposal from any Person that would result in
the Interim Order or Final Order containing any provision that is inconsistent
with this Agreement. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Pembina shall use
commercially reasonable efforts cooperate with and assist KML in seeking the
Interim Order and the Final Order, including by providing to KML, on a timely
basis, any information reasonably required to be supplied by Pembina in
connection therewith.

 



 

 **2.7** **_KML Awards_**

 



 

The Parties acknowledge that the Arrangement will result in a "change in
control" under the KML RSU Plans and, other than in respect of payments to be
made in respect of KML Awards as set forth in the KML Disclosure Letter or as
otherwise set forth in the KML Disclosure Letter, there is no accelerated
vesting or payout of any awards or any other securities of KML nor are there
any change of control, severance, separation or similar payments triggered
under any executive employment or change of control agreements applicable to
any officers, employees, consultants or directors of KML or any of its
Subsidiaries as a result of the completion of the Arrangement. KML confirms
that, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the KML RSU Plans, the KML
Board has approved accelerated vesting of all KML Awards, and all outstanding
KML Awards shall be settled in cash or KML Restricted Voting Shares, as
determined by the KML Board in accordance with the KML RSU Plans prior to the
Effective Time in the manner set forth in the KML Disclosure Letter.

 



 

KML shall be exclusively responsible for any withholding obligations of Taxes
pursuant to the Tax Act or other applicable Laws from any amounts paid in
connection with the settlement of any KML Awards (whether pursuant to this
Section 2.7 or otherwise) or otherwise paid in respect of obligations to KML
Employees, and KML shall deliver the consideration for the foregoing net of
such amounts to KML Employees and holders of KML Awards, as applicable. Any
such amounts deducted, withheld and remitted by KML will be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the KML Employees and
holders of KML Awards, as applicable, in respect of which such deduction,
withholding and remittance was made; provided that such deducted and withheld
amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate Tax authority.

 



 

 **2.8** **_Effective Date_**

 



 

The Arrangement shall become effective at the Effective Time. Upon issuance of
the Final Order and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
precedent in Article 6, each of the Parties shall, as soon as practicable,
execute and deliver such closing documents and instruments and KML shall
proceed to file the Articles of Arrangement, the Final Order and such other
documents as may be required to give effect to the Arrangement with the
Registrar pursuant to Section 193 of the ABCA no later than the fourth
business day following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions precedent
(other than the conditions precedent that by their terms are to be satisfied
as of the Effective Date) or such other date as agreed to in writing by
Pembina and KML, whereupon the transactions comprising the Arrangement shall
occur and shall be deemed to have occurred in the order set out therein
without any further act or formality.

 



 

 **2.9** **_Tax Matters_**

 



 

Pembina and KML shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount
otherwise payable to any KML Shareholder and, for greater certainty, from any
amount payable to a KML Shareholder who has validly exercised, and not
withdrawn, Dissent Rights, as the case may be, under the Plan of Arrangement
such amounts as Pembina or KML, as the case may be, is required or reasonably
believes is required to deduct and withhold from such consideration in
accordance with applicable Laws. Any such amounts will be deducted, withheld
and remitted from the consideration payable pursuant to the Plan of
Arrangement and shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the
KML Shareholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made,
provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity.

 



     

 

 



 

 **2.10** **_Shareholder Communications_**

 



 

Each Party agrees to co-operate with the other Party and, if requested by the
other Party, participate in presentations to securityholders of KML or other
stakeholders of KML, as applicable, regarding the Arrangement. Each Party
shall seek prior consent of the other Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, prior to the making of any presentations
regarding the Arrangement and shall promptly advise, consult and co-operate
with the other Party in issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
statements with respect to this Agreement or the Arrangement and in making any
filing with any Governmental Entity or with any stock exchange, including the
Exchanges, with respect thereto. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to enable the other Party to review and comment on all such press
releases and filings prior to the release or filing thereof; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall be subject to such Partys overriding
obligation to make disclosure in accordance with applicable Laws, and if such
disclosure is required and the other Party has not reviewed or commented on
the disclosure, such Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give
prior oral or written notice to the other Party, and if such prior notice is
not possible, to give such notice immediately following the making of such
disclosure or filing. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 2.10
shall require a notice by KML or its affiliates to Pembina or Pembinas prior
consent in connection with, or prevent KML or any of its affiliates from, (a)
issuing any press releases or otherwise making public statements with respect
to this Agreement or the Arrangement, or (b) making internal announcements or
presentations to employees and having discussions with their respective
securityholders, financial analysts or other stakeholders, in each case so
long as such statements and announcements are consistent with the press
releases, public disclosures or public statements previously made by the
Parties.

 



 

 **2.11** **_U.S. Securities Laws_**

 



 

The Parties agree that the Arrangement will be carried out with the intention
that, and will use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that, the issuance
of Pembina Common Shares to holders of KML Restricted Voting Shares and
holders of Class B Units under the Arrangement will qualify for the exemption
from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act provided by
Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act. Therefore, each Party agrees to
act in good faith, consistent with the intent of the Parties and the intended
treatment of the Arrangement as set forth in this Section 2.11. In order to
ensure the availability of the exemption under Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S.
Securities Act and to facilitate Pembinas compliance with other U.S.
Securities Laws, the Parties agree that the Arrangement will be carried out on
the following basis: (a) the Court will be asked to approve the procedural and
substantive fairness of the terms and conditions of the Arrangement; (b) prior
to the issuance of the Interim Order, the Court will be advised of the
intention of the Parties to rely on the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(10)
of the U.S. Securities Act with respect to the issuance of Pembina Common
Shares to holders of KML Restricted Voting Shares and holders of Class B Units
pursuant to the Arrangement, based on the Courts approval of the Arrangement;
and (c) the Court will be advised prior to the hearing that its approval of
the Arrangement will be relied upon as a determination that the Court has
satisfied itself as to the procedural and substantive fairness of the terms
and conditions of the Arrangement to all Persons who are entitled to receive
Pembina Common Shares pursuant to the Arrangement.

 



 

 **2.12** **_Adjustment to Exchange Ratio_**

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding
Pembina Common Shares shall have been changed into a different number of
shares by reason of any split or consolidation of the issued and outstanding
Pembina Common Shares, then the Exchange Ratio to be paid per KML Restricted
Voting Share and each Class B Unit shall be appropriately adjusted to provide
to holders of KML Restricted Voting Shares and holders of Class B Units the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement
prior to such action and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such
event, be the Exchange Ratio.

from a Governmental Entity in relation to the Arrangement;

 



 

(f) subject to Section 5.4(d), it shall not wilfully or intentionally take any
action, refrain from taking any action or permit any action to be taken or not
taken, which is inconsistent with this Agreement or which would or would

obligations owed by KML to a third party or in respect to customer-specific or
competitively sensitive information and in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement and any other subsequent written agreement that addresses

of Pembina reasonable access at all reasonable times to their officers,
employees, agents, properties, books, records and contracts (but which shall
not include any right of Pembinas Representatives to attend KMLs regular
operations meetings), and shall furnish Pembina with all data and information
as Pembina may reasonably request, subject to any confidentiality obligations
owed by KML to a third party, in respect to customer-specific or competitively
sensitive information, the conditions contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and any other subsequent written agreement that addresses
confidentiality between the Parties, in order to permit Pembina to be in a
position to expeditiously and efficiently continue the businesses and
operations of Pembina and its Subsidiaries and KML and its Subsidiaries
immediately upon, but not prior to, the Effective Date.

 



 

 **5.6** **_Insurance and Indemnification_**

 



 

(a) Pembina agrees that it will maintain in effect, or will cause KML or its
successors to maintain in effect, without any reduction in scope or coverage

are in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and providing coverage
on a "trailing" or "run-off" basis for all present and former directors and
officers of KML with respect to claims arising from facts or events which
occurred prior to the Effective Time. Furthermore, prior to the Effective
Time, KML may, in the alternative, with the consent of Pembina, not to be
unreasonably withheld, purchase run-off directors and officers liability

event none of Pembina, KML or any successor of KML will have any further
obligation under this Section 5.6(a).

existing in favour of present and former officers and directors of KML shall
survive completion of the Arrangement and shall continue in full force and

right to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights of such present and former officers and directors of KML as
provided herein.

individual of such additional purpose, and where required by applicable law,

(a) The Parties acknowledge that some of the assets, rights, interests and
property of the KML Operating Entities are subject to rights of first refusal,
rights of first offer, or other pre-emptive rights of purchase (any such
rights, the " **Rights of First Refusal** ") and that the KML Disclosure
Letter sets out a complete and accurate list of such assets, rights, interests
and property (collectively, the " **ROFR Assets** ") which are triggered by
the Arrangement or any of the transactions contemplated herein. The Parties
acknowledge and agree as to the value allocated to each of the ROFR Assets (a
" **ROFR Value** ") as set forth in the KML Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(b) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, KML shall cause the
applicable KML Operating Entities to prepare and to send notices, in the form
acceptable to Pembina acting reasonably, and using the applicable ROFR Values
set forth in the KML Disclosure Letter, to the Persons holding Rights of First
Refusal and shall provide Pembina a copy of all such notices. KML shall
promptly notify Pembina upon each Person exercising or waiving a Right of
First Refusal or any Right of First Refusal being extinguished.

 



 

(c) In the event a holder of a Right of First Refusal in respect of any ROFR
Assets validly exercises such rights but the purchase of such ROFR Assets is
not completed on the Effective Date or the holder of the Right of First
Refusal has not exercised or waived its Right of First Refusal and the
applicable waiting period thereunder has not yet expired prior to the
Effective Date, provided that this Agreement is not terminated in accordance
with the terms hereof, Pembina shall cause the applicable KML Operating Entity
to comply with the terms of the applicable Right of First Refusal from and
after the Effective Date and the applicable KML Operating Entity shall be
entitled to any proceeds payable in respect of the disposition of such ROFR
Asset.

 



     

 

 



 

(d) The entering into of any agreement, or amendment or waiver of an existing
agreement, between KML or its Subsidiaries and a counterparty to a Right of
First Refusal shall require the prior written approval of Pembina, in its sole
and unfettered discretion.

 



 

 **5.9** **_Replacement of KMI Credit Support_**

certainty, shall include the return, cancellation or release of the Existing
Credit Support).

 



 

 **5.10** **_Cochin Financial Resources Plan_**

 



 

(a) Each of KML and Pembina shall (or shall cause their respective affiliates
to) complete and file with the NEB a Notification of Change in Financial
Resources in respect of the Cochin Financial Resources Plan within 20 business
days following the execution of this Agreement, unless otherwise mutually
agreed to in writing by the Parties. The filing will request that Pembina (or
its applicable affiliate) wishes to assume all obligations in connection with
the Cochin Financial Resources Plan for events arising after the Effective
Date and will provide a replacement plan with respect to financial assurances
acceptable to the NEB to permit the cancellation of the existing insurance
program of KMI which covers $225.0 million of the Cochin Financial Resources
Plan and, at Pembinas option, to permit the cancellation of the KML Credit
Facilities which along with cash on hand and cash flow from operations covers
$75.0 million of the Cochin Financial Resources Plan.

 



 

(b) Each of KML and Pembina shall (or shall cause their respective affiliates
to) promptly file or cause to be filed, no later than 20 business day from the
date hereof, all required filings under the _National Energy Board Act_ for a
Notification of Change in Financial Resources, shall consult and cooperate
with each other in the preparation of such filings, and shall promptly inform
the other Party of any material communication received by such Party from the
NEB regarding the filings.

 



 

(c) Each of KML and Pembina shall provide to the other Party, in advance of
submission to the NEB regarding a Notification of Change in Financial
Resources, a reasonable opportunity to comment on any draft filing,
application or submission by them, and the Party receiving such comments shall
give reasonable consideration to the comments it receives from the other Party
when preparing subsequent drafts and the final version of any filing,
application or submission.

 



 

(d) In the event that a Party deems any of the information that it must
provide to the other Party under Section 5.10(c) to be confidential and
competitively sensitive, the supplying Party may redact such information so
that the receiving Party does not receive such confidential and competitively
sensitive information, except that a non-redacted version shall be provided to
such receiving Partys external legal counsel.

 



 

(e) Pembina shall use commercially reasonable efforts, with the cooperation of
KML, to obtain NEB approval of the Notification of Change in Financial
Resources as soon as is reasonably practicable and in any event prior to the
Effective Date. The provisions of this Section 5.10(e) shall require Pembina
to provide assurances to the NEB that, after the Effective Date, Pembina
(directly and/or through Cochin ULC, as required) will maintain at least
$300.0 million in financial resources, or such other amount as the NEB may
require, including readily accessible resources, in form and substance
acceptable to the NEB, to satisfy the $300.0 million financial resource
requirement, in accordance with subsection 48.13(2) of the _National Energy
Board Act,_ section 2 _of the Pipeline Financial Requirements Regulation_ ,
and in compliance with any NEB direction.

 ** _6.2_** **_Pembina_** ** _Conditions_**

Schedule D shall be true and correct (other than _de minimis_ inaccuracies) as
of the Effective Date as if made on such date (except to the extent such
representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date and except it being
understood that the number of KML Restricted Voting Shares outstanding as
described in paragraph (j) of Schedule D may increase from the number
outstanding on the date of this Agreement solely as a result of vesting of KML
Awards and that the number of KML Awards may change due to their vesting,
expiry or termination in accordance with their terms);

 



 

(ii) in paragraphs (e), (g), (h) and (ii) of Schedule D shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of the Effective Date as if made on such
date; and

 



 

(iii) in the remainder of Schedule D shall be true and correct as of the
Effective Date as if made on such date (except to the extent such
representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date or except as
affected by transactions contemplated or permitted by this Agreement), except
where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material
Adverse Change in respect of KML and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (and
for this purpose, any reference to "material", "Material Adverse Effect" or
other concepts of materiality in such representations and warranties shall be
ignored);

 



 

and KML shall have provided to Pembina a certificate of two executive officers
of KML (on KMLs behalf and without personal liability) certifying the
foregoing on the Effective Date;

 



 

(b) KML shall have complied in all material respects with its covenants herein
to be complied with by it on or prior to the Effective Time, and KML shall
have provided to Pembina a certificate of two executive officers of KML (on
behalf of KML and without personal liability) certifying compliance with such

shall have validly exercised Dissent Rights in respect of the Arrangement that
have not been withdrawn as of the Effective Date; and

 



 

(e) KML and KMI shall have entered into the Transition Services Agreement.

 



 

The conditions set forth in this Section 6.2 are for the exclusive benefit of
Pembina and may be asserted by Pembina regardless of the circumstances or may
be waived in writing by Pembina in its sole discretion, in whole or in part,
at any time and from time to time without prejudice to any other rights which
Pembina may have.

 



 

 **6.3** **_KML Conditions_**

 



 

The obligation of KML to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and
in particular the Arrangement, is subject to the satisfaction, on or before
the Effective Date or such other time specified, of the following conditions:

 



 

(a) the representations and warranties made by Pembina:

 



 

(i) in paragraph (l)(i) of Schedule C shall be true and correct as of the
Effective Date as if made on such date;

 



 

(ii) in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Schedule C shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of the Effective Date as if made on such

Agreement);

 



 

(iii) in paragraph (h) of Schedule C shall be true and correct as of the date
of this Agreement; and

 



 

(iv) in the remainder of Schedule C shall be true and correct as of the
Effective Date as if made on such date (except to the extent such
representations and warranties speak as of an earlier date or except as
affected by transactions contemplated or permitted by this Agreement), except
where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and
correct, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a Material
Adverse Change in respect of Pembina and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole
(and for this purpose, any reference to "material", "Material Adverse Effect"
or other concepts of materiality in such representations and warranties shall
be ignored);

 



 

and Pembina shall have provided to KML a certificate of two executive officers
of Pembina (on Pembinas behalf and without personal liability) certifying the
foregoing on the Effective Date;

 



 

(b) Pembina shall have complied in all material respects with its covenants
herein to be complied with by it on or prior to the Effective Time, and
Pembina shall have provided to KML a certificate of two executive officers of
Pembina (on behalf of Pembina and without personal liability) certifying
compliance with such covenants on the Effective Date; and

 



 

(c) no Material Adverse Change in respect of Pembina and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, shall have occurred after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Date.

 



 

The conditions set forth in this Section 6.3 are for the exclusive benefit of
KML and may be asserted by KML regardless of the circumstances or may be
waived by KML, in its sole discretion, in whole or in part, at any time and
from time to time without prejudice to any other rights which KML may have.

 



     

 

 



 

 **6.4** **_Notice and Cure Provisions_**

 



 

Each Party will give prompt notice to the other Party of the occurrence, or
failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the Effective Date,
of any event, state of facts, circumstance or change in circumstances (actual,
anticipated, contemplated, or to the knowledge of such Party, threatened)
which would, or would reasonably be expected to:

 



 

(a) cause any of the representations or warranties of such Party contained
herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect (or, in the case of
any representations or warranties that are not subject to materiality
qualifications in respect of the conditions contained in Section 6.2(a)(i) or
Section 6.3(a)(i), cause any of such representations or warranties of such
Party to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect); or

 



 

(b) result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such Party,

 



 

and it shall in good faith discuss with the other Party any event, state of
facts, circumstance or change in circumstances (actual, anticipated,
contemplated, or to the knowledge of such Party, threatened) which is of such
a nature that there may be a reasonable question as to whether notice need to
be given to the other Party pursuant to this Section 6.4. The delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
representations, warranties, covenants, conditions or agreements of the
Parties under this Agreement or any remedies available pursuant to this
Agreement with respect thereto to the Party receiving that notice.

 



 

Neither Party may elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(iii) _[Failure to Satisfy Mutual Conditions]_ , Section 8.1(c)(i) _[_
_KML_ _Reps and Warranties and Covenants Condition]_ or Section 8.1(d)(i) _[_
_Pembina_ _Reps and Warranties and Covenants Condition]_ , as applicable,
unless promptly, and in any event prior to the issuance of the Certificate by
the Registrar, the Party intending to terminate this Agreement (the "
**Terminating Party** ") has delivered a written notice (a " **Termination
Notice** ") to the other Party (the " **Receiving Party** ") specifying in
reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, inaccuracies of representations
and warranties, inability to satisfy conditions or other matters which the
Terminating Party is asserting as the basis for termination. If any
Termination Notice is delivered: (a) if such matter is capable of being cured
prior to the Outside Date, the Terminating Party may not exercise such
termination until the earlier of (i) the expiration of a period of 15 business
days from the date of receipt of the Termination Notice by the Receiving
Party, and (ii) the Outside Date, if such matter has not been cured by such
date; provided _however_ that, if the Receiving Party is proceeding diligently
to cure any such matter, the Terminating Party may not exercise such
termination until the Outside Date; and (b) if such matter is incapable of
being cured prior to the Outside Date, the Terminating Party must exercise
such termination not later than the end of the 10th business day from the date
of receipt of the Termination Notice by the Receiving Party, following which
such Terminating Party shall be deemed to have waived its termination right
under Section 8.1(b)(iii) _[Failure to Satisfy Mutual Conditions]_ , Section
8.1(c)(i) _[_ _KML_ _Reps and Warranties and Covenants Condition]_ or Section
8.1(d)(i) _[_ _Pembina_ _Reps and Warranties and Covenants Condition]_ , as
applicable, in respect of the breach or failure of condition to which such
Termination Notice relates. If a Termination Notice has been delivered to KML
within 10 business days prior to the date of the KML Shareholders Meeting,
KML may elect to postpone the KML Shareholders Meeting until the expiry of
such period.

 



 

 **6.5** **_Frustration of Conditions_**

 



 

Neither Pembina nor KML may rely, either as a basis for not consummating the
conditions contemplated by this Agreement or terminating this Agreement and
abandoning the Arrangement, on the failure of any condition set forth in
Sections 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure
was primarily caused by, or primarily resulted from, such Partys failure to
perform any of its covenants or agreements under this Agreement.

 



      

 

 



 

 **6.6** **_Merger of Conditions_**

 



 

Subject to applicable Law, the conditions set out in Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3
shall be conclusively deemed to have been satisfied, waived or released upon
the issuance of a Certificate in respect of the Arrangement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 7 
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS REGARDING NON-SOLICITATION**

 



 

 **7.1** **_KML Covenant Regarding Non-Solicitation_**

 



 

(a) KML shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
solicitations, discussions or negotiations (including through any
Representatives on its behalf), if any, with any Person (other than Pembina
and its Representatives) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and, in
connection therewith, KML shall discontinue access to any of its confidential
information (including any data room), and shall promptly request the return
or destruction of all information respecting KML or any of its Subsidiaries
provided to any Person (other than Pembina or its Representatives) who has
entered into a confidentiality agreement with KML or any of its Subsidiaries
relating to an Acquisition Proposal in the last twelve months and shall use
commercial reasonable efforts to ensure that such requests are honoured. KML
and its Subsidiaries shall take commercially reasonable actions to enforce all
standstill, non-disclosure, non-disturbance, non-solicitation and similar
agreements or covenants that KML or any of its Subsidiaries has entered into
and that KML enters into after the date of this Agreement in accordance with
and subject to the terms of this Agreement (it being acknowledged by Pembina
that KML shall not be obligated to enforce any standstill, non-disclosure,
non-disturbance, non-solicitation and similar agreements or covenants that are
automatically terminated or released as a result of entering into and
announcing this Agreement).

 



 

(b) Except as provided in this Article 7, KML shall not, directly or
indirectly, do or authorize or permit any of its Representatives to do, any of
the following:

 



 

(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate
(including by way of furnishing information) any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiries, proposals or offers relating to any Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding
any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish to any other Person any information with
respect to its businesses, properties, operations, prospects or conditions
(financial or otherwise) in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or any
proposal that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or
participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt of any other
Person to do or seek to do any of the foregoing; provided that KML may (A)
communicate with any Person for the purposes of clarifying the terms of any
inquiry, proposal or offer made by such Person that constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to constitute or lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (B)
advise any Person of the restrictions of this Agreement, and (C) advise any
Person making an Acquisition Proposal that the KML Board has determined that
such Acquisition Proposal does not constitute a Superior Proposal;

 



 

(iii) waive, terminate, amend, modify or release any third party or enter into
or participate in any discussions, negotiations or agreements to waive,
terminate, amend, modify or release any third party from any rights or other
benefits under confidentiality and/or standstill agreements relating to an
Acquisition Proposal (which, for greater certainty, does not prohibit the
automatic release of a party or

 



     

 

 



 

termination of such provisions in accordance with the pre-existing and express
terms of any standstill provision);

 



 

(iv) accept, approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to accept,
approve, endorse or recommend, or take no position or remain neutral with
respect to, any Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that publicly taking
no position or a neutral position with respect to a publicly announced, or
otherwise publicly disclosed, Acquisition Proposal for a period of no more
than five business days will not be considered to be in violation of this
Section 7.1(b)(iv)); or

 



 

(v) accept or enter into, or publicly propose to accept or enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, agreement, arrangement or
undertaking related to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement contemplated under Section 7.1(b)(vi));

 



 

provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision hereof, KML and
its Representatives may, prior to the approval of the Arrangement Resolution
at the KML Shareholders Meeting:

 



 

(vi) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with a third
party that is not in breach of any confidentiality or standstill agreement and
that, without any solicitation, initiation or knowing encouragement or
facilitation, directly or indirectly, after the date of this Agreement, by KML
or any of its Representatives, seeks to initiate such discussions or
negotiations and, subject to execution of a confidentiality agreement in
favour of KML that is on terms that KML determines in good faith are no less
favourable to KML than those found in the Confidentiality Agreement (provided
that such confidentiality agreement shall (A) allow for disclosure thereof,
along with all information provided thereunder, to Pembina as set out below,
(B) allow disclosure to Pembina of the making and terms of any Acquisition
Proposal made by the third party as contemplated herein, and (C) not contain
any provision restricting KML from complying with this Section 7.1) may
furnish to such third party any information concerning KML and its
Subsidiaries and their businesses, properties and assets, in each case if, and
only to the extent that:

 



 

(A) the third party has first made a written _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal,
which did not result from a breach of this Section 7.1, and in respect of
which the KML Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal and financial advisors, constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (disregarding, for the purposes of
such determination, any due diligence or access condition to which such
Acquisition Proposal is subject); and

 



 

(B) prior to furnishing such information to or entering into or participating
in any such discussions or negotiations with such third party regarding the
Acquisition Proposal, KML shall:

 



 

(1) provide prompt notice to Pembina to the effect that it is furnishing
information to or entering into or participating in discussions or
negotiations with such third party, together with a copy of the
confidentiality agreement referenced above and, if not previously provided to
Pembina, copies of all information provided to such third party concurrently
with the provision of such information to such third party;

 



 

(2) notify Pembina orally and in writing of any inquiries, offers or proposals
with respect to an actual or contemplated Superior

 



     

 

 



 

Proposal (which written notice shall include a summary of the material terms
of such proposal (and any amendments or supplements thereto)) and, if the
proposal includes equity consideration, the identity of the Person making it,
and shall include copies of any such inquiries, offers or proposals made in
writing and any amendments to any of the foregoing within 24 hours of the
receipt thereof; and

 



 

(3) keep Pembina promptly informed of the status and reasonable details of any
such inquiry, offer or proposal and answer Pembinas reasonable questions with
respect thereto; and

 



 

(vii) accept, recommend, approve or enter into an agreement to implement a
Superior Proposal from a third party or make a Change in Recommendation, but
only if prior to such acceptance, recommendation, approval or implementation
or making such Change in Recommendation, the KML Board concludes in good
faith, after considering all proposals to adjust the terms and conditions of
this Agreement as contemplated by Section 7.1(c) and after receiving the
advice of outside legal counsel that the failure by the KML Board to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws,
and KML (A) complies with its obligations set forth in this Section 7.1, (B)
terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(d)(ii), and (C)
concurrently therewith pays the amount required by Section 8.3(b)(ii) to
Pembina.

 



 

(c) Following determination by the KML Board that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, KML shall give Pembina, orally and in
writing, at least five complete business days advance notice of any decision
by the KML Board to accept, recommend, approve or enter into an agreement to
implement a Superior Proposal or to make a Change in Recommendation, which
notice shall confirm that the KML Board has determined that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and shall identify the third party
making the Superior Proposal and KML shall provide Pembina with a true and
complete copy thereof and the agreement to implement the Superior Proposal and
any amendments thereto. During such five business day period, KML agrees not
to accept, recommend, approve or enter into any agreement to implement such
Superior Proposal and not to release the party making the Superior Proposal
from any standstill provisions and shall not make a Change in Recommendation.
In addition, during such five business day period KML shall, and shall cause
its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with Pembina and
its financial and legal advisors to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Arrangement as would enable KML to
proceed with the Arrangement as amended rather than the Superior Proposal. In
the event Pembina proposes to amend this Agreement and the Arrangement on a
basis such that the KML Board determines that the alternative proposed
transaction is no longer a Superior Proposal and so advises the board of
directors of Pembina prior to the expiry of such five business day period, the
KML Board shall not accept, recommend, approve or enter into any agreement to
implement such Acquisition Proposal and shall not release the party making the
Acquisition Proposal from any standstill provisions and shall not make a
Change in Recommendation. In the event that KML provides the notice
contemplated by this Section 7.1(c) on a date which is less than five business
days prior to the KML Shareholders Meeting, KML may, and Pembina shall be
entitled to require KML to adjourn or postpone the KML Shareholders Meeting
to a date that is not more than 10 business days after the date of such
notice.

 



 

(d) Each successive amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that results in an
increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or value of such
consideration) to be received by KML Shareholders or other material terms or
condition thereof, shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the
purposes of Section 7.1(c), and Pembina shall be afforded

 



     

 

 



 

a new five business day period from the date on which Pembina received all of
the materials set forth in Section 7.1(c) with respect to the new Superior
Proposal from KML.

 



 

(e) The KML Board shall promptly reaffirm the recommendation and determination
outlined in Section 2.2(a) by press release after (i) any Acquisition Proposal
which is publicly announced is determined not to be a Superior Proposal, or
(ii) the Parties have entered into an amended agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(c) which results in any Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior
Proposal.

 



 

(f) KML shall ensure that its affiliates and Representatives are aware of the
provisions of this Section 7.1. KML shall be responsible for any breach of
this Section 7.1 by KMLs affiliates or KMLs Representatives.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit KML, the KML Board or the KML
Independent Committee from complying with Part 2  Division 3 of NI 62-104 and
similar provisions in respect of U.S. Securities Laws relating to the
provision of directors circulars and making appropriate disclosure with
respect thereto to KMLs securityholders.

(i) the termination of this Agreement:

 



 

(A) by Pembina pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) _[Failure to Satisfy Mutual

directive (whether or not having the force of Law), is related to the
Competition Act Approval; or

 



 

(B) by Pembina or KML pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) _[Occurrence of Outside

Section 5.4(a);

 



 

(ii) the termination of the Cochin Purchase Agreement by Seller (as defined

(a) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 8.3 are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that
without these agreements the Parties would not enter into this Agreement, and
that the amounts set out in Section 8.3 represent liquidated damages which are
a genuine pre-estimate of the damages, including opportunity costs, which
Pembina or KML, as applicable, will suffer or incur as a result of the event
giving rise to such damages and resultant termination of this Agreement, and
are not penalties. Each Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to
raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are excessive or punitive.

 



 

(b) Each Party agrees that the payment of the KML Termination Fee or the
Reverse Termination Fee in the manner provided in Section 8.3 is the sole
monetary remedy of the Party receiving such payment in respect of the event
giving rise to such payment; provided that this limitation shall not (a) apply
in the event of fraud or willful or intentional breach of this Agreement by
the Party making such payment as set forth in Section 8.2, and (b) prior to
any termination of this Agreement, preclude a Party from seeking injunctive
relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach by the other Party of its
covenants in this Agreement, or otherwise obtain specific performance of any
of such covenants in accordance with Section 9.8.

 



 

 **8.5** **_Fees and Expenses_**

 



 

Each Party shall pay all fees, costs and expenses incurred by such Party in
connection with this Agreement and the Arrangement. Pembina and KML shall
share equally any filing fees and applicable Taxes payable for or in respect
of any application, notification or other filing made in respect of any
regulatory process in respect of the transactions contemplated by the
Arrangement, including under the Competition Act and the CTA.

of the holders KML Restricted Voting Shares. A Dissenting KML Shareholder who
is entitled to be paid by Pembina the fair value of the holders KML
Restricted Voting Shares shall, pursuant to Section 3.1(a), be deemed to have

Encumbrances) to Pembina for cancellation without any further act or formality
notwithstanding the provisions of section 191 of the ABCA.

 



 

4.3 A Dissenting KML Shareholder who for any reason is not ultimately entitled
to be paid the fair value of the holders KML Restricted Voting Shares shall

dissenting holder of KML Restricted Voting Shares notwithstanding the

4.6 For greater certainty, in addition to any other restrictions in section
191 of the ABCA, any person who has voted in favour of the Arrangement
Resolution shall not be entitled to dissent with respect to such persons KML
Restricted Voting Shares for the Arrangement. In addition, a Dissenting KML
Shareholder may only exercise Dissent Rights in respect of all, and not less
than all, of its KML Restricted Voting Shares.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5 
OUTSTANDING CERTIFICATES AND FRACTIONAL SHARES**

 



 

5.1 Forthwith following the Effective Time, Pembina and KML shall, subject to

Shareholders, the number of Pembina Common Shares issuable in respect of the
KML Restricted Voting Shares required by Section 3.1(e), and (ii) to the
holders of Class B Units, the number of Pembina Common Shares issuable in
respect of the Class B Units required by Section 3.1(g), and (b) cause to be
paid to the KML Special Voting Shareholders, the aggregate KML Special Voting
Share Consideration in respect of the KML Special Voting Shares required by
Section 3.1(f).

 



 

5.2 Upon surrender to the Depositary (in respect of the KML Restricted Voting
Shares) or Pembina (in respect of the KML Special Voting Shares and the Class
B Units), as applicable, for cancellation of a certificate or certificates (as
applicable) which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
outstanding KML Voting Shares or Class B Units, as the case may be, together
with a duly completed and executed applicable Letter of Transmittal and such
additional documents and instruments as the Depositary or Pembina, as
applicable, may reasonably require, each KML Shareholder represented by such
surrendered certificate(s) shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
and the Depositary or Pembina, as applicable shall deliver to such holder, the
consideration which such holder has the right to receive under this Plan of
Arrangement for such KML Voting Shares or Class B Units, as the case may be,
less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 3.2, and any certificate(s) so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

 



 

5.3 Until deposited as contemplated by Section 5.2, each certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented KML Voting Shares and
Class B Units shall be deemed after the

 



      

 

 



 

Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such deposit the
consideration and other property to which the holders of such KML Voting
Shares or Class B Units are entitled under the Arrangement, or as to those
held by Dissenting KML Shareholders, other than those Dissenting KML
Shareholders deemed to have participated in the Arrangement pursuant to
Section 4.3, to receive the fair value of the KML Voting Shares or Class B
Units, as applicable, represented by such certificates. Any such certificate
formerly representing KML Voting Shares or Class B Units not duly surrendered
on or before the last Business Day prior to the third anniversary of the
Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim by or interest of any former
KML Shareholder of any kind or nature against KML or Pembina. On such date,
all consideration and other property to which such former holder was entitled
shall be deemed to have been surrendered to KML or Pembina, as applicable.

 



 

5.4 No KML Shareholder shall be entitled to receive any consideration with
respect to such KML Voting Shares or Class B Units, other than the
consideration and other property to which such holder is entitled to receive
under the Arrangement and, for greater certainty, no such holder will be
entitled to receive any interest, dividend, premium or other payment in
connection therewith.

 



 

5.5 If any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented an interest in outstanding KML Voting Shares or Class B Units, as
applicable, that were exchanged pursuant to Section 3.1 has been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such certificate to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Depositary (in respect of the KML Restricted Voting Shares) or Pembina (in
respect of the KML Special Voting Shares and the Class B Units), as
applicable, will issue and deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate the consideration and other property to which the holder
is entitled pursuant to the Arrangement as determined in accordance with the
Arrangement. The person who is entitled to receive such consideration and
other property shall, as a condition precedent to the receipt thereof, give a
bond satisfactory to Pembina and its transfer agent in such form as is
satisfactory to Pembina and such transfer agent, or otherwise indemnify KML,
Pembina and the transfer agent, to the reasonable satisfaction of such
persons, against any claim that may be made against any of them with respect
to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

5.6 No certificates representing fractional Pembina Common Shares shall be
issued under the Arrangement. In lieu of any fractional Pembina Common Shares,
each registered KML Restricted Voting Shareholder or holder of Class B Units
otherwise entitled to a fractional interest in Pembina Common Shares will
receive the nearest whole number of Pembina Common Shares. For greater
certainty, where such fractional interest is greater than or equal to 0.5, the
number of Pembina Common Shares to be issued will be rounded up to the nearest
whole number and where such fractional interest is less than 0.5, the number
of Pembina Common Shares to be issued will be rounded down to the nearest
whole number. In calculating such fractional interests, all KML Restricted
Voting Shares or Class B Units registered in the name of or beneficially held
by such holders thereof or their nominee shall be aggregated.
