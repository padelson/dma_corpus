contrary, no deduction or withholding shall be made under any provision of
Tax Law, including under Section 1445 of the Code, from any payments made to
a Seller or any Subsidiary thereof unless (i) in the case of any deduction or
withholding other than under Section 1445 of the Code, Horizon OP shall have
furnished Sun, no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the
applicable payment date, with a written notice referring to this _Section
1.9(c)_ and describing the approximate amount of the deduction or withholding
to be made (it being agreed that, in the event of any such written notice and
with respect to such deduction or withholding, (x) Sun and Horizon OP shall
promptly enter into discussions in good faith to determine if applicable
circumstances permit the lack of such deduction or withholding and (y) to the
extent Horizon OP determines in good faith that such deduction or withholding
is required, and Sun determines in good faith that such deduction or
withholding is not required, there shall be no such deduction or withholding
upon an agreement by Sun in writing to indemnify Horizon OP against any such
deduction, withholding, interest, penalties and expenses that subsequently

Horizon OP or its Affiliates) or (ii) in the case of any deduction
or withholding under Section 1445 of the Code, such Seller fails to furnish

Dividends or other distributions with respect to Horizon Common Stock or Sun Common Stock with a record date after the REIT Merger Effective Time shall be paid by Horizon or Sun, as applicable, to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the Horizon Common Stock or Sun Common Stock, as applicable, represented thereby and shall only be paid to a holder of any unsurrendered Certificate once such holder surrenders the Certificate in accordance with this _Section 1.9_. No cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 1.9(g)_, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this _Section 1.9_. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of such Certificate, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, (x) the amount of any cash in lieu of any fractional Horizon Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 1.9(g)_ and (y) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the REIT Merger Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole share of Horizon Common Stock or Sun Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the REIT Merger Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole share of Horizon Common Stock or Sun Common Stock.

distributions with a record date prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time
which may have been declared or made by Trust on such Trust Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the REIT Merger Effective Time. At the
REIT Merger Effective Time, the share transfer books of Trust shall be closed
and thereafter, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
share transfer books of Trust of the Trust Shares which were outstanding
prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, nor shall there be any further
issuances of Trust Shares or any Trust Share Rights. If, after the REIT
Merger Effective Time, Certificates are presented to Horizon OP or Sun for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Section
1.9_. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. None of Sun, Trust, Horizon OP or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any REIT Merger Consideration, the Sun Common Share Amount, cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 1.9(g)_ or dividends or other distributions delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (other than dividends or distributions paid to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 1.9(d)_, which the Exchange Agent shall retain in the Exchange Fund, subject to applicable escheat and other similar Laws) delivered to the Exchange Agent by Horizon OP pursuant to this Agreement that remains unclaimed for twelve (12) months after the REIT Merger Effective Time shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Horizon OP, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with _Section 1.9(c)_ shall thereafter, subject to the immediately preceding sentence, look only to Horizon OP for delivery of the REIT Merger Consideration (other than the Class A EPS Sun Cash Amount) and any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Horizon Common Stock pursuant to _Section 1.9(g)_, subject to applicable escheat and other similar Laws, but not the dividends or distributions paid to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 1.9(d)_.

At any time, Horizon OP shall be entitled, in its reasonable discretion, to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the REIT Merger Consideration such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the payment of such REIT Merger Consideration under the Code or under any provision of Tax Law; _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything in this _Section 1.9(f)_ to the contrary, no deduction or withholding shall be made under any provision of Tax Law, including under Section 1445 of the Code, from any payments made to a Seller or any Subsidiary thereof unless (i) in the case of any deduction or withholding other than under Section 1445 of the Code, Horizon OP shall have furnished Sun, no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the applicable payment date, with a written notice referring to this _Section 1.9(f)_ and describing the approximate amount of the deduction or withholding to be made (it being agreed that, in the event of any such written notice and with 

    ##### 

  

 

respect to such deduction or withholding, (x) Sun and Horizon OP shall
promptly enter into discussions in good faith to determine if applicable
circumstances permit the lack of such deduction or withholding and (y) to the
extent Horizon OP determines in good faith that such deduction or withholding

Exchange Agent shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid or issued to the holder of the Certificates in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent. 

   

 (g) _No Fractional Shares_. 

    

 (i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional Horizon Common Stock or Sun Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same, shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or otherwise, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote, to receive dividends or to any other rights of a stockholder of Horizon or Sun, respectively. 

   

 (ii) In lieu of the issuance of any fractional Horizon Common Stock, pursuant to this Agreement, each holder of one or more Certificates shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest cent (with .5 of a cent rounded up), determined by multiplying (A) the average closing price of one (1) share of Horizon Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") on the twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date by (B) the fraction of a share of Horizon Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive under this _Section 1.9_.

 Section 1.11 _Tax Treatment_. The parties hereto (i) intend that for federal, and applicable state and local, income tax purposes, the REIT Merger will be treated as a taxable purchase by Horizon OP of all of Trusts outstanding shares of beneficial interest and (ii) shall prepare and file their applicable Tax Returns based on such treatment. The parties hereto intend that for federal, and applicable state and local, income Tax purposes, the SLT Merger will be treated as an acquisition by Horizon OP of SLT Units in exchange for the SLT Merger Consideration. Each SLT Unitholder who participates in the SLT Merger shall be deemed, by such SLT Unitholders act of receiving and accepting its share of the SLT Merger Consideration, to have agreed to the characterization of the receipt of cash (including any cash deemed to be received pursuant to Section 752 of the Code) as a taxable sale of all or a portion of its SLT Units, to the extent of such cash received or deemed received, to Horizon OP.

Acquired Hotel) or (y) require a consent, approval or authorization that would
not be required if such 1031 Hotel was not a Replacement Hotel (but was
otherwise an Acquired Hotel) and such consent, approval or authorization
would result in material Consent Costs or has not been obtained after the

Impairment. 

   

 Section 3.13 _Intellectual Property_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.13_ of the Sun Disclosure Letter or as, individually and in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Sun Material Adverse Effect, (i) Sun and the Sun Subsidiaries own or have a valid right to use all Sun Intellectual Property that is used in the operation of the Acquired Business in the manner in which it is currently used, (ii) no Acquired Entity or, with respect to the Acquired Business, Seller has misappropriated or is infringing upon the Intellectual Property of others, (iii) Sun and the Sun Subsidiaries have taken reasonable actions to protect and maintain the Sun Intellectual Property that is used in the Acquired Business and (iv) there are no claims, suits or other actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Sun, threatened that seek to limit or challenge the validity, enforceability, ownership, or right to use, sell or license the Sun Intellectual Property owned by Sun or any of its Affiliates, or the right to use or license any Sun Intellectual Property that Sun or any of its Affiliates use or holds for use but does not own, that is used in the Acquired Business, nor, to the Knowledge of Sun, is there any valid basis therefor. 

  

 Section 3.14 _Taxes_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Sun Parties, the Acquired Entities and each member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any Sun Party or any Sun Subsidiary is (or, during any taxable year either beginning on or after January 1, 1998 or for which the statute of limitations has not expired, was) a member (each such entity, a " _Sun Taxpayer_ ") (A) has filed (or has had filed on its behalf) all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to do so) and all such Tax Returns are accurate and complete in all material respects, (B) has paid (or Sun or Trust has paid on its behalf) all material Taxes of it (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) that are due and payable and (C) has complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 3121, and 3402 of the Code 

   ##### 

  

    

or any similar provision of Law) and has, within the time period prescribed
by Law, withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental Entities all
material amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable
Laws. The most recent audited financial statements of Sun and Trust contained
in the Filed Trust SEC Documents, the Unaudited Combined Interim Financial
Statements and the Unaudited Stub Period Financial Statements reflect or
(when delivered) will reflect, as applicable, an adequate reserve (excluding
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) for all material unpaid Taxes of the Sun
Taxpayers for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of
such financial statements. From the Sun Financial Statement Date through the
date of this Agreement, no Sun Taxpayer has incurred any material liability
for Taxes other than in the Ordinary Course. From the date of this Agreement
through Closing, no Acquired Entity will have incurred any material liability
for Taxes other than (i) in the Ordinary Course or (ii) pursuant to the
Baseline Restructuring Steps (as modified in accordance with  _Exhibit A_).
Since January 1, 1995 or, if later, the acquisition by Trust of a direct
or indirect interest therein, none of Trust, WandS Denver Corp., WandS Lauderdale
Corp. or WandS Seattle Corp. (each such entity, a " _REIT Entity_ ") has
incurred any material liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or
4981 of the Code, including any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction
described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code. No Acquired Entity is the subject
of any audit, examination, or other proceeding in respect of material Taxes,
and to the Knowledge of Sun, no audit, examination or other proceeding in
respect of material Taxes involving any Acquired Entity is being considered
by any Tax authority. No deficiencies for any material Taxes have been
proposed, asserted or assessed against any Acquired Entity, Sun (to the
extent that any Acquired Entity could be held liable for such Taxes) or any
Sun Affiliate (to the extent that any Acquired Entity could be held liable
for such Taxes) that will not have prior to the Closing Date been fully paid
(including any applicable interest charges, penalties or other additions to
Taxes), and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are
pending. No Acquired Entity has received written notice from any Governmental
Entity in a jurisdiction in which such entity does not file a Tax Return
stating that such entity is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction. As of the completion of the Closing, (i) no Acquired Entity
(other than Trust) that is domestic and is treated as a corporation for
United States federal income tax purposes will have any C Corporation Earnings
and Profits and (ii) the aggregate amount of C Corporation Earnings and
Profits of the Acquired Entities that are foreign and are treated as
corporations for United States federal income tax purposes will not exceed
$50,000,000 (taking into account only the earnings and profits of
such entities that have positive earnings and profits). As used in this
Agreement: (i) " _Taxes_ " means (A) all taxes, charges, fees, levies and
other assessments, including income, gross receipts, excise, real or personal
property, sales, withholding (including dividend withholding and withholding
required pursuant to Sections 1445 and 1446 of the Code), social security,
occupation, use, service, license, payroll, franchise, transfer and recording
taxes, fees and charges, including estimated taxes, imposed by the United
States or any taxing authority (domestic or foreign), whether computed on a
separate, consolidated, unitary, combined or any other basis, and any
interest, fines, penalties or additional amounts attributable to, or imposed
upon, or with respect to any such taxes, charges, fees, levies or other
assessments and (B) any liability for amounts described in _clause (A)_ of
another Person under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of Law), as a result of transferee liability, by Law, by Contract
or otherwise and (ii) " _Tax Return_ " means any report, return, document,
declaration or other information or filing required to be supplied to any
taxing authority or jurisdiction (foreign 

   ##### 

  

    

or domestic) with respect to Taxes, including any schedule or attachment
thereto and any amendment thereof, any information returns, any documents
with respect to or accompanying payments of estimated Taxes, or with respect
to or accompanying requests for the extension of time in which to file any
such report, return, document, declaration or other information.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 3.14_ to the contrary, any
references to "Taxes" for purposes of this _Section 3.14(a)_ shall exclude
any Taxes (within the meaning of _clause (A)_ of the definition of " _Taxes_
") of Sun or any Retained Subsidiary, other than Taxes for which any Acquired
Entity or Horizon Party could be held liable post-Closing or the non-payment
of which could result in the Acquired Assets being subject to a material
Encumbrance. 

  

 (b) Since January 1, 1995 or, if later, the acquisition by Trust of a direct or indirect interest therein, Trust and each other REIT Entity (i) has elected to be subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code (and any similar provision of state Tax Law) and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for all taxable years since and including 1995 or, if later, the acquisition by Trust of a direct or indirect interest therein, (ii) has operated since and including January 1, 2005 to the date of this representation, and intends to continue to operate through and including the Closing Date, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT and (iii) has received no written notice that a challenge to its status as a REIT is pending or threatened. Each Acquired Entity that is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company has been treated since its formation and continues to be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as a partnership or as an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes and not as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. In addition, each Subsidiary of Trust or any other REIT Entity that is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company has not, since the latest of January 1, 1995, its formation or the acquisition by Trust or such other REIT Entity, as applicable, of a direct or indirect interest therein, owned any Assets (including securities) that would cause Trust or such other REIT Entity to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. SLT is not a publicly traded partnership within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is taxable as a corporation pursuant to Section 7704(a) of the Code. For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1995 (in the case of Trust) or January 1, 1998 (in the case of other REIT Entities) and ending on or before December 31, 2000, each Subsidiary of Trust or any other REIT Entity which is a corporation (for federal income tax purposes) has been on the last day of each calendar quarter during which Trust or such other REIT Entity has owned an interest in such corporation representing more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such corporation, a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code or a REIT. For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, each Subsidiary of Trust or any other REIT Entity which is a corporation (for federal income tax purposes) has been, on the last day of each calendar quarter during which Trust or such other REIT Entity has owned an interest in such corporation representing more than 10% of the value of the outstanding securities of such corporation or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such corporation, a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code, a taxable REIT subsidiary of Trust or such REIT Entity under Section 856(l) of the Code, a REIT, or a corporation which qualifies under the transitional rules set forth in Section 546(b) of the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999. Each Subsidiary of Trust that is a "qualified REIT subsidiary" under Section 856(i) of the Code is set forth in _Section 3.14(b)_ of the Sun Disclosure Letter. No Acquired Entity that is either a REIT Entity or a Subsidiary of a REIT Entity will hold, as of the Closing, any Asset (x) the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code as a result of an election 

   ##### 

  

    

under IRS Notice 88-19, Temporary Treas. Reg. §1.337(c)-5T, Treas. Reg.
§1.337(d)-5, Treas. Reg. §1.337(d)-6 or not making an election under Treas.
Reg. §1.337(d)-7 or (y) which is subject to a consent filed pursuant to
Section 341(f) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. 

  

 (c) To the Knowledge of Sun, as of the date hereof, each of the REIT Entities is a "domestically-controlled" REIT within the meaning of Section 897(h) of the Code. 

  

 (d) There are no Encumbrances for material Taxes (other than for current Taxes not yet due and payable) on any Acquired Assets. 

  

 (e) _Section 3.14(e)_ of the Sun Disclosure Letter contains a list of each tax-indemnity, tax-sharing or tax-allocation agreement that any Acquired Entity is a party to or bound by (or, except for the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement, will become a party to or bound by). _Section 3.14(e)_ of the Sun Disclosure Letter contains a list of all Contribution Agreements that any Acquired Entity has entered into, is a party to, or is subject to. As used herein, a " _Contribution Agreement_ " means an agreement, oral or written, (A) that has one of its purposes to permit a Person to take the position that such Person could defer federal taxable income that otherwise might have been recognized upon a transfer of property or contribution to any Acquired Entity that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and that (i) prohibits or restricts in any manner the disposition of any Assets of any Acquired Entity, (ii) requires that any Acquired Entity maintain, put in place, or replace, indebtedness, whether or not secured by one or more Acquired Properties or (iii) requires that any Acquired Entity offer to any Person at any time the opportunity to guarantee or otherwise assume, directly or indirectly (including through a "deficit restoration obligation," guarantee (including a "bottom" guarantee), indemnification agreement or other similar arrangement), the risk of loss for federal income Tax purposes for indebtedness or other liabilities of any Acquired Entity, (B) that specifies or relates to a method of taking into account book-tax disparities under Section 704(c) of the Code with respect to one or more Assets of an Acquired Entity or (C) that requires a particular method for allocating one or more liabilities of any Acquired Entity under Section 752 of the Code. As of the date hereof, no person has raised, or to the Knowledge of Sun threatened to raise, a material claim against an Acquired Entity for any breach of any Contribution Agreement. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Horizon Transactions will not result in a breach of any Contribution Agreement other than as set forth in _Section 3.14(e)_ of the Sun Disclosure Letter. The copies of the Contribution Agreements provided to Horizon are complete and correct, and no such Contribution Agreement has been amended or modified. Other than the Contribution Agreements identified in _Section 3.14(e)_ of the Sun Disclosure Letter, there are no written or oral Contracts or similar arrangements in effect which impose material obligations or restrictions on any Acquired Entity or their affiliates with respect to the sale of properties or the maintenance of indebtedness or a particular method for allocating one or more liabilities of any Acquired Entity under Section 752 of the Code or otherwise. For purposes of this _Section 3.14(e)_, Contribution Agreements shall exclude any agreements that otherwise meet the definition of such term, but that will expire pursuant to their respective terms immediately upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than any Contribution Agreement that will expire as a result of a breach of such Contribution Agreement. 

  

 (f) None of the Acquired Assets is property required to be treated as being owned by any other person pursuant to the "safe harbor lease" provisions of former 

   ##### 

  

    

Section 168(f)(8) of the Code. None of the Acquired Assets directly or
indirectly secures any debt the interest on which is tax-exempt under Section
103(a) of the Code. None of the Acquired Assets is "tax-exempt use property"
within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code. 

  

 (g) None of the Acquired Entities nor any predecessors of such entities by merger or consolidation has within the past three years been a party to a transaction intended to qualify under Section 355 of the Code or under so much of Section 356 of the Code as it relates to Section 355 of the Code. 

  

 (h) Sun acquired SHC in a transaction constituting a reverse acquisition within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-75(d)(3), with the consolidated group of SHC being considered to have continued for federal income tax purposes and with Sun and the members of its consolidated group at the time of such acquisition being considered to have become members of the consolidated group of SHC. 

  

 (i) To the Knowledge of Sun, no gaming, wagering or other similar activities are conducted at or in connection with any Acquired Hotel by any Person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who is legally authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such Acquired Hotel. 

  

 Section 3.15 _No Brokers_. Except for Bear, Stearns and Co. Inc. (" _Bear, Stearns_ ") and Deutsche Bank AG, in each case whose fees are solely payable by Sun or any Retained Subsidiary, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission, or the reimbursement of expenses, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Horizon Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Sun or any Sun Subsidiary. 

  

 Section 3.16 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.16_ of the Sun Disclosure Letter, since January 1, 2001, neither Sun nor any Sun Subsidiary has violated or failed to comply with any Law (including Privacy Laws) applicable to the Acquired Business, Acquired Hotels or Acquired Entities, except in each case to the extent that such violation or failure, individually and in the aggregate, has not resulted in and would not reasonably be expected to result in a Sun Material Impairment. Each of Sun, each Seller (with respect to the Acquired Business), each Acquired Entity and each Sun Subsidiary that is a management company of an Acquired Property owns and/or possesses all permits, licenses, variances, authorizations, exemptions, orders, registrations and approvals of all Governmental Entities (the " _Permits_ ") which are required for the businesses, activities and operations of the Acquired Business, except where the absence of such Permits, individually and in the aggregate, has not resulted in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Sun Material Impairment. Each of Sun, each Seller (with respect to the Acquired Business), each Acquired Entity and each Sun Subsidiary that is a management company of an Acquired Property has been in compliance in all respects with the terms of its Permits, except for such instances of non-compliance which have been cured or which, individually and in the aggregate, have not resulted in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a Sun Material Impairment. All such Permits are in full force and effect and neither Sun nor any Sun Subsidiary has received notice that any suspension, modification or revocation of any of them is pending or, to the Knowledge of Sun, threatened nor, to the Knowledge of Sun, do any grounds exist for any such action, except for such 

   ##### 

  

    

suspensions, modifications or revocations that, individually and in the
aggregate, have not resulted in and would not reasonably be expected to
result in a Sun Material Impairment.

of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, as applicable, and has
all requisite corporate or other power and authority to own, operate, lease
and encumber its properties and carry on its business as now being conducted.
Each Horizon Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign corporation or other limited liability entity and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed, individually and in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to (i) have a Horizon Material Adverse Effect or
(ii) prevent or delay in any material respect the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or
the Horizon Transactions or otherwise prevent any Horizon Subsidiary
from performing its obligations under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements in any material respect. Complete and correct copies of the
Organizational Documents of Horizon OP and REIT Merger Sub, in each case as
amended, restated or supplemented to the date of this Agreement, have
been previously made available to Sun. The Organizational Documents of each
Horizon Subsidiary that is a Horizon Party are in effect and, to the

 Section 4.6 _SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Corporate Governance_. 

  

 (a) Each of Horizon and Horizon OP has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements, certifications and other documents required to be filed with the SEC since December 31, 2002 (collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the " _Horizon SEC Documents_ "). All of the Horizon SEC Documents, as of their respective filing dates and, as applicable, effective times, complied in all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to such Horizon SEC Documents as of the applicable filing date or effective time. None of the Horizon SEC Documents, at the time of filing or, as applicable, of becoming effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements (including the related notes) of Horizon and the Horizon Subsidiaries included in the Horizon SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof (i) complied in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) has been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and (iii) fairly presented in all material respects and in accordance with the applicable requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, the consolidated financial position of Horizon and the Horizon Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended. 

  

 (b) Each of Horizon and Horizon OP has been and is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. No officer or director of Horizon is currently indebted to Horizon or Horizon OP. 

  

 (c) Each of Horizon and Horizon OP has designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to it and its consolidated Subsidiaries is made known to the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of it (or, in the case of Horizon OP, the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer of Horizon, as its sole general partner) by others within those entities. The principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Horizon (including in their capacities as officers of the sole general partner of Horizon OP) have made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange 

   ##### 

  

    

Act or Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules
and regulations promulgated by the SEC. 

  

 (d) Horizon has designed and maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP (within the meaning of such terms under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). Horizon has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation to its respective auditors and the audit committee of Horizons Board of Directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Horizons ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in its internal controls over financial reporting. Horizon has delivered to Sun any such disclosures (i) prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) with respect to evaluations after the date of this Agreement, promptly following the disclosures to the applicable auditors and audit committee. 

  

 Section 4.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in _Section 4.7_ of the Horizon Disclosure Letter, since December 31, 2004 (the " _Horizon Financial Statement Date_ "), Horizon and Horizon OP have conducted their business in the Ordinary Course and there has not been (a) any circumstance, event, occurrence, change or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Horizon Material Adverse Effect or (b) on or prior to the date of this Agreement, any other action or omission by Horizon or any Horizon Subsidiary which, if occurring during the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing, would constitute a breach of any of the following subsections of  _Section 5.2_: _(b)_ , _(e)_ and, with respect to any of the foregoing,  _(h)_. 

  

 Section 4.8 _Taxes_. 

  

 (a) Each of the Horizon Parties and each member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any Horizon Party or any Horizon Subsidiary is or was a member (each such entity, a " _Horizon Taxpayer_ ") (A) has filed (or has had filed on its behalf) all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to do so) and all such Tax Returns are accurate and complete in all material respects; (B) has paid (or Horizon has paid on its behalf) all material Taxes of it (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) that are due and payable; and (C) has complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, 3121, and 3402 of the Code or any similar provision of any other Law) and has, within the time period prescribed by Law, withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental Entities all material amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable Laws. The most recent audited financial statements of Horizon contained in the Horizon SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) for all material unpaid Taxes of the Horizon Taxpayers for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. Since the Horizon Financial Statement Date, no Horizon Taxpayer 

   ##### 

  

    

has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the
Ordinary Course. Since January 1, 1999, Horizon has not incurred any material
liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code,
including any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section
857(b)(6) of the Code. No Horizon Taxpayer is the subject of any audit,
examination, or other proceeding in respect of material Taxes, and to the
Knowledge of Horizon, no audit, examination or other proceeding in respect of
material Taxes involving any Horizon Taxpayer is being considered by any Tax
authority. No deficiencies for any material Taxes have been proposed,
asserted or assessed against any Horizon Taxpayer that have not been
resolved, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes
are pending. No Horizon Taxpayer has received written notice from any
Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction in which such entity does not file a
Tax Return stating that such entity is or may be subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction. 

  

 (b) Since January 1, 1999, Horizon (i) has elected to be subject to taxation as a REIT within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code (and any similar provision of state Tax Law) and has satisfied all requirements to qualify as a REIT for all taxable years since and including 1999, (ii) has operated since, and intends to continue to operate on or before the Closing Date, in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT and (iii) has received no written notice that a challenge to its status as a REIT is pending or threatened. Each Horizon Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company has been treated since its formation and continues to be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as a partnership or as an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes and not as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. In addition, each Horizon Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company has not since the latest of January 1, 1999, its formation or the acquisition by Horizon of a direct or indirect interest therein, owned any Assets (including securities) that would cause Horizon to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code, unless any such Asset was disposed of prior to the last day of the calendar quarter in which it was acquired or within the applicable cure period provided for in Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. Horizon OP is not a publicly traded partnership within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is taxable as a corporation pursuant to Section 7704(a) of the Code. For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1999 and ending on or before December 31, 2000, each Horizon Subsidiary which is a corporation (for federal income tax purposes) has been on the last day of each calendar quarter during which Horizon has owned an interest in such corporation representing more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such corporation, a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code. For all taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, each Horizon Subsidiary which is a corporation (for federal income tax purposes) has been, on the last day of each calendar quarter during which Horizon has owned an interest in such corporation representing more than 10% of the value of the outstanding securities of such corporation or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such corporation, a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code, a taxable REIT subsidiary of Horizon under Section 856(l) of the Code, a REIT, or a corporation which qualifies under the transitional rules set forth in Section 546(b) of the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999. Each Horizon Subsidiary that is a "qualified REIT subsidiary" under Section 856(i) of the Code is set forth in _Section 4.8(b)_ of the Horizon Disclosure Letter. 

  

 (c) To the Knowledge of Horizon, as of the date hereof, Horizon is a "domestically-controlled" REIT within the meaning of Section 897(h) of the Code. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) There are no Encumbrances for material Taxes (other than current Taxes not yet due and payable) on the assets of any Horizon Taxpayer. 

  

 (e) No Horizon Taxpayer, or any predecessors of such entity by merger or consolidation, has within the past three (3) years been a party to a transaction intended to qualify under Section 355 of the Code or under so much of Section 356 of the Code as it relates to Section 355 of the Code. 

  

 Section 4.9 _No Brokers_. Except for Goldman Sachs and Co. (" _GS andCo._"), whose fees are solely payable by Horizon or any Horizon Subsidiary, no broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission, or the reimbursement of expenses, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Horizon Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Horizon or any Horizon Subsidiary. 

  

 Section 4.10 _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in _Section 4.10_ of the Horizon Disclosure Letter, there is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Horizon, threatened against or affecting Horizon or any Horizon Subsidiary directly relating to or involving any of their respective Assets, or any of the directors, officers, employees or agents thereof who may be subject to indemnification by Horizon or any Horizon Subsidiary that, individually or in the aggregate, if determined or resolved adversely, would reasonably be expected to (i) have, or has had, a Horizon Material Adverse Effect or (ii) prevent or materially impair the ability of any Horizon Party to perform any of its respective obligations hereunder or under any Ancillary Agreement or prevent or delay in any material respect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the Horizon Transactions, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator outstanding against Horizon or any Horizon Subsidiary that has had or would reasonably be expected to have any such effect. 

  

 Section 4.11 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Horizon has received the opinion of GSandCo., its financial advisor, which has not been withdrawn or otherwise modified, to the effect that as of the date of this Agreement, based upon and subject to the matters set forth in such opinion, the Consideration (as such term is defined in such opinion) in the aggregate to be paid by Horizon and certain of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to Horizon. 

  

 Section 4.12 _Horizon Stockholder Approval_. The affirmative vote with respect to the issuance of the shares of Horizon Common Stock in the Closing Transactions, of a majority of the votes cast by holders of shares of Horizon Common Stock; _provided_ that, the total vote cast represents over 50% of the Horizon Common Stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote, is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock or equity interest of any Horizon Party necessary or required to adopt or approve this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the Horizon Transactions, except for the approval of (x) Horizon OP, as the sole member of REIT Merger Sub, and (y) REIT Merger Sub, as the general partner of SLT Merger Sub. The approval by Horizon, which has already been granted, is the only vote of any partner of Horizon 

   ##### 

  

    

OP necessary or required to approve this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and the
Horizon Transactions. 

  

 Section 4.13 _Ownership of REIT Merger Sub and SLT Merger Sub; No Prior Activities_. 

  

 (a) Each of REIT Merger Sub and SLT Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. 

  

 (b) All of the outstanding membership interests of REIT Merger Sub are owned directly by Horizon OP. All of the outstanding limited partnership interests of SLT Merger Sub are owned by REIT Merger Sub, its general partner, and Horizon OP. There are no options, warrants or other rights (including registration rights), agreements, arrangements or commitments to which either REIT Merger Sub or SLT Merger Sub is a party of any character relating to the issued or unissued membership interests of, or other equity interests in, REIT Merger Sub or SLT Merger Sub, respectively, or obligating REIT Merger Sub or SLT Merger Sub, respectively, to grant, issue or sell any membership interests of, or other equity interests in, REIT Merger Sub or SLT Merger Sub, respectively, by sale, lease, license or otherwise. There are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of REIT Merger Sub or SLT Merger Sub, respectively, to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any membership interests of REIT Merger Sub or SLT Merger Sub, respectively. 

  

 (c) Except for agreements, obligations or Liabilities incurred in connection with its organization and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, REIT Merger Sub has not and will not have incurred, and SLT Merger Sub has not and will not have incurred, directly or indirectly, through any Subsidiary or Affiliate, any obligations or Liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or arrangements with any Person. 

  

 Section 4.14 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. Except as set forth in _Section 4.14_ of the Horizon Disclosure Letter, neither Horizon nor, to the Knowledge of Horizon, any Horizon Subsidiary has violated or failed to comply with any Law (including Privacy Laws) applicable to their business, except in each case to the extent that such violation or failure, individually and in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Horizon Material Adverse Effect. Horizon and the Horizon Subsidiaries own and/or possess all Permits which are required for the businesses, activities and operations of their business, except where the absence of such Permits, individually and in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Horizon Material Adverse Effect. Horizon and each Horizon Subsidiary has been in compliance in all respects with the terms of its Permits, except for such instances of non-compliance which have been cured or which, individually and in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Horizon Material Adverse Effect. All such Permits are in full force and effect and neither Horizon nor any Horizon Subsidiary has received notice that any suspension, modification or revocation of any of them is pending or, to the Knowledge of Horizon, threatened nor, to the Knowledge of Horizon, do any grounds exist for any such action, except for such suspensions, modifications or revocations that, individually and in the 

   ##### 

  

    

aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Horizon
Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 4.15 _Environmental Matters_. Except as set forth in Section 4.15 of the Horizon Disclosure Letter:

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.4(a)_, each party hereto may refuse to deliver any books or records if it believes in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel), that doing so is reasonably likely to cause an attorney-client or work product privilege which such party would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to such books or records and such undermining of privilege could in such partys good faith judgment (after consultation with outside counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such partys position in any pending, or 

   ##### 

  

    

what such party believes in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) is reasonably likely to be, future litigation (other than amongst the
parties hereto); _provided_ that, the parties hereto shall cooperate in
seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such books or records to the
extent doing so would not (in the good faith belief of the party attempting
to disclose such books or records (after consultation with outside counsel))
reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to
such books or records; _provided_ , _further_ , that the disclosing party
shall (i) notify the other party that such disclosures are reasonably likely
to cause such privilege to be undermined and (ii) communicate to the other
party in reasonable detail (A) the facts giving rise to such notification and
(B) the subject matter of such books or records. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 6.4_ , _Section 2.4(a)(ii)_ or _Section 3.1(b)_ to the
contrary, Sun and the Sun Subsidiaries shall not be required to provide Books
and Records (or any other information) relating to Tax matters to the extent
the Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement expressly provides

 Section 6.8 _Non-Assignment_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign, license, sublicense, lease, sublease, convey or transfer at Closing any Acquired Asset, including any Acquired Entity, Permit, Contract or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, as to which consent or approval to assignment, license, sublicense, lease, sublease, conveyance or transfer thereof or amendment thereof (including consents and approvals of Governmental Entities) is required but has not been obtained as of the Closing Date unless and until such consent, approval or amendment is no longer required or has been obtained. Each of the parties hereto shall use, and cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain any such consent, approval or amendment, including after the Closing Date. Upon obtaining any such consent, approval or amendment after the Closing, such consent, approval or amendment to be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Horizon OP, the Horizon Parties and Sun shall cause any applicable Acquired Asset to be transferred to Horizon OP or one or more Horizon Subsidiaries (as designated by Horizon OP and permitted by such consent, approval or amendment) on the terms that would have applied to such transfer had it occurred in the transactions as contemplated by this Agreement or the Horizon Transactions. 

   

 (b) Subject to _Section 6.21_, in the event and to the extent that the parties hereto are unable to obtain any such required consent, approval or amendment to transfer, license, sublicense, lease, sublease, convey or assign any Acquired Asset to Horizon OP or one or more Horizon Subsidiaries (as designated by Horizon OP), the parties hereto shall cooperate to agree to a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Horizon OP or one or more Horizon Subsidiaries (as designated by Horizon OP) shall obtain the economic claims, rights and benefits under the Acquired Asset, in the manner set forth below, with respect to which such consent, approval or amendment has not been obtained in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding any failure of the parties hereto to agree to such a mutually agreeable arrangement, Sun shall, and shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries to (i) continue to hold, and to 

    ##### 

  

 

the extent required by the terms applicable to such Asset, operate the Asset,
in the case of real or personal property, and to be bound thereby in the case
of Contracts, (ii) cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangement proposed
by Horizon OP to provide to Horizon OP or the designated Horizon Subsidiaries
the benefits arising under any such Acquired Asset which were to arise out of
its transfer pursuant to this Agreement, the structure of which is such that
such Acquired Asset shall qualify as a real estate asset within the meaning
of Section 856(c)(5)(B) of the Code (a " _Qualifying Asset_ ") and the income
derived therefrom shall qualify as income described in Sections
856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ")
(such transfer a " _Qualified Transfer_ "), including accepting such
reasonable and lawful direction as Horizon OP shall request of Sun and (iii)
enforce at Horizon OPs request, or allow Horizon OP and the Horizon
Subsidiaries to enforce (in which case, solely for such purpose, Sun shall
constitute and appoint Horizon OP or the subject Horizon Subsidiaries as its
true and lawful attorney-in-fact), any rights of Sun and the
Retained Subsidiaries as to such Acquired Asset against the issuer thereof or
the other party or parties thereto (including the right to elect to terminate
such of the foregoing in accordance with the terms thereof upon the request
of Horizon OP). Sun shall, and shall cause the Retained Subsidiaries to,
without further consideration therefor, and without right of set-off (except
for actually incurred costs and expenses to the extent Horizon OP is
responsible therefor under this  _Section 6.8_), pay and remit to Horizon OP
promptly all monies, rights and other considerations received in respect of
such Qualifying Asset, net of any costs and expenses incurred by Sun and the
Retained Subsidiaries in connection with such Qualifying Asset to the extent
such costs and expenses would have been borne by Horizon OP if such
Qualifying Asset had been properly transferred to Horizon OP pursuant to
_Article 2_ at the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, unless an
arrangement under this _Section 6.8(b)_ shall in its entirety constitute a

have been given effect in whole or in part. 

   

 (c) To the extent that Horizon OP or the Horizon Subsidiaries are provided the benefits of any Acquired Asset pursuant to _Section 6.8(b)_, Horizon OP or such Horizon Subsidiary shall, subject to _Section 6.8(h)_, (i) be responsible for the Assumed Liabilities, if any, arising under or related to such Acquired Asset, (ii) perform for the benefit of the counterparty or counterparties thereto, the obligations of Sun or the Retained Subsidiary, as the case may be, thereunder or in connection therewith, but only to the extent (x) that such performance by Horizon OP or the Horizon Subsidiaries would not result in any default thereunder or in connection therewith and (y) such performance pertains to the Acquired Business and the benefits provided to Horizon OP or the Horizon Subsidiaries in the Qualified Transfer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if Horizon OP or the Horizon Subsidiaries shall fail to perform to the extent required herein and such failure continues for ten (10) business days following notice thereof to Horizon OP, Sun and the Retained Subsidiaries shall thereafter cease to be obligated under this  _Section 6.8_ to maintain the Qualified Transfer which is the subject of such failure to perform unless and until such situation is remedied and (iii) reimburse Sun for, and hold it harmless from, all Liabilities (not already used to set-off monies, rights or other consideration paid to Horizon OP or a Horizon Subsidiary pursuant to _Section 6.8(b)_) incurred or asserted as a result of any actions (or omissions to act) of Sun or any Retained Subsidiary taken at the direction of, and in all material respects in the manner prescribed by, Horizon OP or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to _Section 6.8(b)_, in each case in _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_  or _(iii)_ only to the extent such Liabilities would have been borne by Horizon OP if such Acquired Asset had been properly transferred to Horizon OP pursuant to _Article 2_ at the Closing.

 (d) If any consent, approval or amendment is required to assign, license, sublicense, lease, sublease, convey or transfer any Excluded Asset from any Acquired Entity to Sun or any Retained Subsidiary, Sun shall use, and cause each of the Sun Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain any such consent, approval or amendment, including after the Closing Date. The Horizon Parties, at Suns expense, shall cooperate with Sun and the Sun Subsidiaries in obtaining any such consent, approval or amendment. Upon obtaining any such consent, approval or amendment after the Closing, the Horizon Parties and Sun shall cause any applicable Excluded Asset to be transferred to Sun, or a Retained Subsidiary designated by Sun in writing, without further consideration therefor. 

   

 (e) Subject to _Section 6.21_, in the event and to the extent that Sun is unable to obtain any such required consent, approval or amendment required in order for an Acquired Entity to transfer, license, sublicense, lease, sublease, convey or assign any Excluded Asset to Sun or one or more of the Retained Subsidiaries, the parties hereto shall cooperate to agree to a mutually agreeable arrangement under which Sun or one or more Sun Subsidiaries shall obtain the economic claims, rights and benefits under the Excluded Asset, in the manner set forth below, with respect to which such consent, approval or amendment has not been obtained in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding any failure of the parties hereto to agree to such a mutually agreeable arrangement, but subject to _Section 7.2(e)(i)_, Horizon OP shall, and shall cause the Acquired Entities, from and after the Closing, to (i) continue to hold and to be bound thereby, in the case of Contracts, (ii) cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangement proposed by Sun to provide to Sun or the Sun Subsidiaries the benefits arising under any such Excluded Asset, including accepting such reasonable and lawful direction as Sun shall request of Horizon OP and (iii) enforce at Suns request, or allow Sun and its Affiliates to enforce, any rights of the applicable Acquired Entity under any such Excluded Asset against the issuer thereof or the other party or parties thereto (including the right to elect to terminate such of the foregoing in accordance with the terms thereof upon the request of Sun). Any incremental Taxes payable with respect to an Excluded Asset by any taxable REIT subsidiary to which such Excluded Asset has been transferred, including all Taxes payable on any payments received under this  _Section 6.8(e)_ and all Taxes payable on the distribution or transfer of, if any, such Excluded Asset out of such taxable REIT subsidiary and the expenses of the transfer of such Excluded Asset to such taxable REIT subsidiary shall be borne by Sun. The reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable professional fees and expenses) incurred by Horizon OP or the Horizon Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Entities) at Suns request, or incurred by Sun or the Retained Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to any of the actions contemplated under  _clause (iii)_ above, shall be borne solely by Sun. Horizon OP shall, and shall cause the Acquired Entities to, without further consideration therefor, remit to Sun promptly all monies, rights and other considerations received in respect of such Excluded Asset, net of any costs and expenses incurred by Horizon or any Horizon Subsidiaries in connection with such Excluded Asset. The parties hereto agree for tax purposes to report the actual transfer of such Assets to Sun or one or more of the Retained Subsidiaries on the Closing Date. 

   

 (f) In the case of an Asset described in _Section 6.8(e)_, Sun shall, and shall cause its Retained Subsidiaries to, perform for the benefit of the issuer thereof, or the other party or parties thereto, the obligations of Horizon OP or its relevant Affiliate, as the case may be, thereunder or in connection therewith.

 (g) In the event that Sun cannot convey, transfer, assign or deliver, directly or indirectly, as contemplated by this Agreement, any Excluded Asset at Closing by reason of the failure or inability to obtain a required consent, approval or amendment, and, at any time thereafter, Horizon OP, in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its outside tax counsel, determines that the Excluded Asset or the income generated by such Excluded Asset would reasonably be expected to cause a significant risk that Trust, WandS Seattle Corp., WandS Denver Corp., Horizon, SHC or any Horizon Foreign Currency REIT would fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code, then Horizon OP and the Horizon Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Entities) shall no longer have any obligation with respect to such Excluded Asset, except pursuant to this _Section 6.8(g)_. Without limiting the foregoing, if, in the good faith judgment of Horizon OP, after consultation with its outside tax counsel, the holding of such Excluded Asset by the applicable Horizon Subsidiary would not reasonably be expected to cause a significant risk that Trust, WandS Seattle Corp., WandS Denver Corp., Horizon, SHC or any Horizon Foreign Currency REIT would fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code, in such event, Horizon OP shall give prompt notice to Sun thereof and continue to allow Sun to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such required consent, approval or amendment in accordance with _Section 6.8(d)_ until the date that is ten (10) business days after such notice is delivered to Sun. In the event Sun fails to obtain such required consent, approval or amendment prior to such date, Horizon OP shall thereafter cause the applicable Horizon Subsidiary to, at Suns election, (i) use commercially reasonably efforts to transfer such Excluded Asset to Sun, or a Retained Subsidiary designated by Sun in writing, without further consideration therefor (unless, in the good faith judgment of Horizon OP, after consultation with its outside tax counsel, the transfer of such Excluded Asset would reasonably be expected to cause a significant risk that Trust, WandS Seattle Corp., WandS Denver Corp., Horizon, SHC or any Horizon Foreign Currency REIT would fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code, in which case this _clause (i)_ may not be elected by Sun), (ii) in the event that, in the good faith judgment of Horizon OP, the transfer of such Excluded Asset by the Acquired Entity that holds such Excluded Asset to a taxable REIT subsidiary of Horizon, and the holding of such Excluded Asset by such taxable REIT subsidiary, would not reasonably be expected to cause a significant risk that Trust, WandS Seattle Corp., WandS Denver Corp., Horizon, SHC or any Horizon Foreign Currency REIT would fail to qualify as a REIT under the Code, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Excluded Asset to be transferred to such taxable REIT subsidiary, or (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts (A) to sell such Excluded Asset to one or more third parties in one or more arms-length transactions and (B) taking into account all potential Losses to Horizon OP described in _clause (i),_ to maximize the net proceeds of any such sale. In the event Sun elects _clause (i)_ of the immediately preceding sentence, Sun shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Losses arising out of Third Party Claims (as such term is defined in the Indemnification Agreement) with respect to the transfer of such Excluded Asset to Sun. Horizon OP shall cause the applicable Horizon Subsidiaries to remit to Sun the net proceeds of any such sale, after setting off all costs, expenses and other Losses (as such term is defined in the Indemnification Agreement) of Horizon OP and the applicable Horizon Subsidiaries in connection with such transactions. Upon receipt by Sun of such payment in full, neither Sun nor Horizon OP nor any Horizon Subsidiary shall have any further obligation under this _Section 6.8(g)_ with respect to such Excluded Asset. 

   

 (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Sun shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Losses arising out of (i) any gross negligence or willful misconduct by Sun or a Retained Subsidiary in connection with this _Section_

 _6.8_ , and any arrangements pursuant thereto, (ii) any claim by a third
party that there had occurred any default or breach (or alleged default or
breach) by Sun or Horizon OP or any of their respective Subsidiaries to the
extent it arises by reason of the fact that (in accordance with _Section 6.8_
) (A) in the case of an Acquired Asset, Horizon OP or one of its Subsidiaries,
rather than Sun or one of its Subsidiaries, is, or has been, performing Suns
or its Subsidiarys obligations under, or obtaining Suns or its
Subsidiaries benefits under, an Acquired Asset that has not been assigned,
licensed, sublicensed, leased, subleased, conveyed or transferred to Horizon
OP or one of its Subsidiaries, but excluding from the foregoing any default
or breach (or alleged default or breach) to the extent related to any defect
in the performance by Horizon OP or its Subsidiary itself or (B) in the case
of an Excluded Asset, Sun or one of its Subsidiaries, rather than Horizon or
one of its Subsidiaries, is performing Horizon OPs or its Subsidiarys
obligations under, or obtaining Horizon OPs or its Subsidiaries benefits
under, an Excluded Asset that has not been assigned, licensed, sublicensed,
leased, subleased, conveyed or transferred, as applicable, to Sun or one of
its Subsidiaries or (iii) except to the extent arising out of any gross
negligence or willful misconduct by Horizon OP or its Affiliates, and subject
(in the case of an Acquired Asset) to _Section 6.8(c)_, any arrangements or
actions contemplated by this _Section 6.8_.

 (j) Nothing in this _Section 6.8_ shall permit or require any act, omission or arrangement which, in the reasonable determination of Horizon, could adversely affect the REIT status of Horizon or, after the Closing, WandS Seattle Corp., WandS Denver Corp., SHC or any Horizon Foreign Currency REIT.

 Section 6.14 _Auditor s Consent and Cooperation_.

The Sun Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause EandY, including by providing customary representation letters and other customary documents and instruments, subject to EandYs usual procedures and professional standards and EandY being given reasonable opportunity to review such SEC Filings or offering documents and documents incorporated by reference therein at Horizons sole cost and expense, (A) to consent to the inclusion of any of its audit reports on the Audited Combined Historical Financial Statements and, if applicable, the 2005 Audited Financial Statements in any SEC Filing (and to the references therein to EandY as experts) and (B) to issue customary comfort letters (concerning matters which are the subject of the Audited Combined Historical Financial Statements, the Unaudited Combined Interim Financial Statements or, if applicable, the 2005 Audited Financial Statements) that may be required in connection with any offering of debt or equity securities by Horizon or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective successors. 

   

 (b) If EandY fails, for any reason whatsoever, to consent to the inclusion of any such audit reports on the Audited Combined Historical Financial Statements or, if applicable, the 2005 Audited Financial Statements in any SEC Filing (and to the references therein to EandY as experts) or to provide such comfort letters, Sun shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide Horizons independent accountants reasonable access to its books and records and personnel reasonably required in order to audit the Audited Combined Historical Financial Statements and, if applicable, 2005 Audited Financial Statements and to conduct a SAS 100 review of the Unaudited Combined Interim Financial Statements so that Horizon may

expeditiously cause any or all of such financial statements to be reaudited,

information made available to such auditors that is not directly related to
the Acquired Business or the Acquired Assets. Sun acknowledges that if EandY
fails to consent to the inclusion of any such audit reports in any SEC Filing
(and to the references therein to EandY as experts) or to provide such comfort
letters, and Horizon or any of its successors is denied in any manner
whatsoever the access provided for in this _Section 6.14_, Horizon and its

 (b) Without limiting the Sun Parties or the Horizon Parties obligations under this Agreement, including under _Section 6.3_, upon receiving any Knowledge or other notice of the existence of any Deferral Trigger, (i) Sun or Horizon OP, as applicable, shall promptly give notice to Horizon OP or Sun, as applicable, of the existence of such Deferral Trigger and (ii) the Sun Parties, or the Sun Parties and the Horizon Parties, in the case of a Deferral Trigger referred to in _Section 6.18(a)(i)_, _Section 6.18(a)(iv)(A)(1)_ or _Section 6.18(a)(vii)_, shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such Deferral Trigger to be cured prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that, the Sun Parties shall not be required to use reasonable best efforts to cure any Deferral Trigger arising from a casualty event or condemnation event. 

   

 (c) From time to time prior to the Closing, (A) in the event that one or more of the Deferral Triggers described in _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ ,  _(vii)_ , _(viii)_ or _(ix)_ of _Section 6.18(a)_ (the " _Horizon Deferral Triggers_ ") has occurred with respect to any one or more Acquired Hotels or Acquired Entities, Horizon OP may elect, in its sole discretion, and (B) in the event that one or more of the Deferral Triggers described in _clause (i)_ , _(vi)_ or _(vii)_ of _Section 6.18(a)_ (the " _Sun Deferral Triggers_ ") has occurred with respect to any one or more Acquired Hotels or Acquired Entities, Sun may elect, in its sole discretion, to exclude (subject to _Section 6.18(f)_ ) any one or more of such Acquired Hotels or Acquired Entities, as applicable, from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; _provided_ that, (I) any such election must be made by written notice from a Sun Party to Horizon OP, or from a Horizon Party to Sun, as applicable, (II) such notice must identify the Acquired Hotels and Acquired Entities to be excluded and (III) subject to _Section 6.18(d)_, the exclusion of the Acquired Hotels and Acquired Entities identified in any such notice will be effective on the earlier of (1) the Closing Date and (2) the later of (x) the date that is twenty (20) business days after such notice is delivered to Sun or Horizon OP, as applicable, and (y) the date set forth in such notice as the effective date of such exclusion; _provided_ , _further_ , that no Acquired Hotel or Acquired Entity will be excluded pursuant to any such notice if all of the Horizon Deferral Triggers, in the case of a notice delivered by a Horizon Party, or all of the Sun Deferral Triggers, in the case of a notice delivered by a Sun Party, identified in such notice as relating to such Acquired Hotel or Acquired Entity have been cured prior to the date on which such exclusion otherwise would have been effective pursuant to this _Section 6.18(c)_. In any event in which (i) Horizon OP makes an election with respect to an alleged Horizon Deferral Trigger or Sun makes an election with respect to an alleged Sun Deferral Trigger and (ii) within five (5) business days of receiving notice of such Deferral Trigger, Sun or Horizon OP, as applicable, delivers written notice to the other party claiming that such a Deferral Trigger has not occurred or is not continuing, the parties hereto shall cooperate to reach an agreement with respect thereto and, if no such agreement is reached, the dispute shall be submitted to, and resolved exclusively pursuant to, arbitration in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the " _Rules_ ") of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (" _JAMS_ "). This clause shall not preclude the parties hereto from seeking equitable or provisional remedies in aid of arbitration or to preserve the status quo from a court of competent jurisdiction, pending a decision by the arbitrator. All arbitration shall take place in the County of Montgomery, State of Maryland, with one mutually acceptable arbitrator experienced in the hotel industry presiding at such arbitration proceeding. If after ten (10) business days the parties cannot agree on an 

    ##### 

  

 

acceptable arbitrator, then JAMS shall appoint an arbitrator in accordance
with the Rules. The arbitrator shall render a written decision stating
reasons therefor in reasonable detail within 30 days after being appointed.
Decisions pursuant to such arbitration shall be final, conclusive and binding
on the parties hereto for purposes of this _Section 6.18_. Judgment upon the
award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction over the subject matter and the party against whom enforcement
is sought. The fees and expenses of such arbitration (including the fees of
the arbitrator and reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses) and of any
action to enforce an arbitration award shall be paid by the party that does
not prevail in such arbitration, and may be assessed in the arbitration award
or the judgment entered on such award, as the case may be. The parties hereto
expressly waive all rights whatsoever to file an appeal in the arbitration
forum against any award by the arbitrator hereunder; _provided_ , _however_
, that the foregoing shall not limit the rights of either party to bring a
judicial proceeding in any applicable jurisdiction to confirm, enforce or
enter judgment upon such award or to vacate, modify or correct the award.
Except as necessary in judicial proceedings involving this
arbitration provision or an award rendered hereunder, or to obtain interim
relief pending an award, or as reasonably determined by the disclosing party
to be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange, neither a party nor
an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any
arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of all parties. Any
disputed Deferral Trigger shall be deemed to have occurred and be continuing
(which the parties hereto shall be deemed to have elected to exclude from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements); 
_provided_ that, such Deferral Trigger shall be deemed to be not continuing at
such time, if ever, that (i) upon final conclusion of the arbitration
referred to in this _Section 6.18(c)_ with respect thereto, it is determined
that no such Deferral Trigger is continuing or (ii) the parties hereto
otherwise agree that such Deferral Trigger is not continuing. 

   

 (d) With respect to each Acquired Hotel and Acquired Entity to be excluded pursuant to  _Section 6.18(c)_ (a " _Deferred Asset_ "): 

    

 (i) the Sun Parties shall cause such Deferred Asset to be transferred, prior to Closing, to a Retained Subsidiary in which no Acquired Entity has any direct or indirect Interest; _provided_ that, the Sun Parties shall have the right to delay the Closing to the extent reasonably necessary to effect such transfer (such delay shall not exceed five (5) business days after the date on which the election is made to exclude such Deferred Asset from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the Horizon Transactions); _provided_ , _further_ , that Sun will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ for a number of days following the Termination Date equal to the number of days by which the Closing was delayed pursuant to the immediately preceding proviso; and 

   

 (ii) subject to _Section 6.18(f)_, as of and subject to the Closing, such Deferred Asset shall be deemed to be an Excluded Asset or Retained Subsidiary, as applicable, and the representations, warranties, covenants and conditions in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (other than _Section 6.18(f)_ and, for the purposes of  _Section 6.18(f)_, the defined terms and Sections used or referenced therein), and any applicable Schedules, Exhibits or sections of any disclosure letter shall, as of and subject to the Closing, be modified accordingly with respect to such Deferred Asset. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) The Cash Amount shall be reduced by the aggregate Acquired Hotel Agreed Amounts for all Deferred Assets; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Acquired Hotel identified as the "Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel" on _Schedule 10.1(d)_ (or one or more Acquired Entities in which such Acquired Hotel is held) is a Deferred Asset, then the Cash Amount shall be reduced further by $5,600,000. 

   

 (f) _Post-Closing Actions_. 

    

 (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to each Deferred Asset, Sun (or, in the case of a Deferral Trigger described in _Section 6.18(a)(i)_ , _6.18(a)(iv)(A)(1)_ or _Section 6.18(a)(vii)_, Sun and Horizon) shall be required, whether before, on or after the Closing, until the applicable Post-Closing Deferral Deadline to use reasonable best efforts to cure each Deferral Trigger with respect to each Deferred Asset; _provided_ that, Sun shall not be required to use reasonable best efforts to cure any Deferral Trigger arising from a casualty event or condemnation event. 

   

 (ii) With respect to any Deferred Asset, in the event that all of the Sun Deferral Triggers, if any, applicable to such Deferred Asset have been cured (or there are otherwise no Sun Deferral Triggers then occurring), Horizon OP may elect to acquire such Deferred Asset by delivering to Sun, at any time, and from time to time, on or prior to the Post-Closing Deferral Deadline for such Deferred Asset, a written notice (the " _Post-Closing Acquisition Notice_ ") setting forth the Deferred Asset to be acquired and the Horizon Subsidiary that will acquire such Deferred Asset; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Horizon OP may not deliver a Post-Closing Acquisition Notice with respect to any Deferred International Hotel so long as the Horizon Deferral Trigger under  _Section 6.18(a)(ix)_ is continuing, unless such Post-Closing Acquisition Notice elects the acquisition of all the Deferred International Hotels not then subject to a Horizon Deferral Trigger (other than the Horizon Deferral Trigger under _Section 6.18(a)(ix)_ ) and at least one (1) of the Primary International Hotels. Horizon OP shall acquire such Deferred Asset on a business day agreed upon by Sun and Horizon which shall be no more than sixty (60) days after the date of such notice. 

   

 (iii) With respect to any Deferred Asset, in the event that all of the Horizon Deferral Triggers, if any, applicable to such Deferred Asset have been cured (or there are otherwise no Horizon Deferral Triggers then occurring), Sun may elect to require Horizon OP (or a Horizon Subsidiary designated by Horizon OP) to acquire such Deferred Asset by delivering to Horizon OP, at any time, and from time to time, on or prior to the Post-Closing Deferral Deadline for such Deferred Asset, a written notice (the " _Post-Closing Sale Notice_ " and together with the Post-Closing Acquisition Notice, the " _Post-Closing Notices_ ") setting forth the Deferred Asset to be acquired. Horizon OP shall acquire such Deferred Asset on a business day agreed upon by Sun and Horizon which shall be no more than sixty (60) days after the date of such Post-Closing Sale Notice; _provided_ that, Horizon OPs obligations to acquire any Deferred Asset pursuant to this _Section 6.18(f)(iii)_ shall be subject to the following conditions, any one or more of which may be waived by Horizon OP in its sole discretion: (A) no Horizon Deferral Trigger has occurred and is continuing with respect to such Deferred Asset ( _provided_

   ##### 

  

    

that, for purposes of this _Section 6.18(f)(iii)_, all references to the
Closing and the Closing Date included or referenced in the definition of
"Deferral Trigger", and in the other Sections of this Agreement that are
incorporated or referenced therein, shall be deemed to refer to the
applicable closing or applicable closing date, as the case may be, with
respect to such Deferred Asset); (B) there shall not be or have been any
state of facts, change, development, effect, condition or occurrence that,
individually or in the aggregate, has resulted in, or would be reasonably
expected to result in, a Horizon Deferral Trigger with respect to such
Deferred Asset; (C) Sun and Trust shall have complied in all material
respects with the covenants set forth in _Sections 5.1_,  _6.2_ , _6.19(c)_
and _6.19(d)_ with respect to such Deferred Asset until and including the
applicable closing date; and (D) all lenders, trustees, agents and
other applicable third parties with respect to any Specified Indebtedness

waivers, approvals or other documents required for such Specified
Indebtedness to be assumed, or remain in place at the applicable Acquired
Entity, in connection with the acquisition of such Deferred Asset contemplated
by this _Section 6.18(f)_, in each case without resulting in any violation
of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
giving rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
material obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under any material
Specified Indebtedness. 

   

 (iv) On the closing date set forth in any Post-Closing Notice (subject to the conditions set forth in _clause (iii)_ of this _Section 6.18(f)_), (A) Sun shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Horizon OP or one or more Horizon Subsidiaries designated by Horizon OP, and Horizon OP or the applicable Horizon Subsidiaries shall purchase, acquire and accept from Sun or its applicable Subsidiaries, all right, title and interest of Sun and the Sun Subsidiaries in and to such Deferred Asset, (B) Sun or its applicable Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Horizon OP or its applicable Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall execute and deliver all Ancillary Agreements and other certificates, instruments and deliveries that would have been delivered at Closing if such Deferred Asset had been transferred on the Closing Date as an Acquired Hotel or Acquired Entity, as applicable, (C) without limiting the deliveries required by _clause (B)_ , Horizon OP or one or more Horizon Subsidiaries shall deliver or cause to be delivered, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Sun in writing at least five (5) business days prior to the applicable closing date, an amount equal to the sum of the Acquired Hotel Agreed Amounts (in each case as adjusted pursuant to _clause (v)_ of this _Section 6.18(f)_ ) for the Deferred Assets (plus $5,600,000 in the event the Acquired Hotel identified as the "Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel" on _Schedule 10.1(d)_ (or the Acquired Entities in which such Acquired Hotel is held) is included in such Deferred Assets) being transferred to Horizon OP or its Subsidiaries at such closing and (D) from and after that closing, each Deferred Asset transferred to Horizon OP or its subsidiaries shall be deemed as of the Closing to have been an Acquired Hotel or an Acquired Entity, as applicable, and the representations, warranties, covenants and conditions in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and, with respect thereto, any applicable Schedules, Exhibits or sections of any disclosure letter shall be deemed to have reverted to their form prior to modification pursuant to _Section 6.18(d)(ii)_. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (v) For the purposes of _clause (iv)_ of this _Section 6.18(f)_, Sun and the Horizon Parties (including indirectly through the Acquired Entities and the Directly Acquired Assets Owners) shall receive debits and credits against the Acquired Hotel Agreed Amounts for the Deferred Assets in the manner set forth in _Article 8_ (other than with respect to Adjusted Indebtedness); _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Article 8_, (A) the "Apportionment Time" with respect to any Deferred Asset, including for the purposes of Adjusted Indebtedness, shall be based on the applicable closing date under this _Section 6.18(f)_, rather than the Closing Date and (B) the applicable Horizon Parties shall receive a credit in the amount of any Adjusted Indebtedness with respect to each Deferred Asset. All disputes with respect to adjustments with respect to any Deferred Assets shall be resolved in the manner set forth in _Section 8.4_;  _provided_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Article 8_, the time periods set forth therein shall run from the applicable closing date under this  _Section 6.18_ rather than the Closing Date. 

  

 (g) In the event that one or more Acquired Hotels or Acquired Entities is designated a Deferred Asset pursuant to this _Section 6.18_, the Sun Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Horizon OP as promptly as practicable with any revised financial statements or other financial information reasonably requested, from time to time, by Horizon OP with respect to the Acquired Business (excluding the Deferred Assets), including Audited Combined Historical Financial Statements, 2005 Audited Financial Statements and Unaudited Combined Interim Financial Statements. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) once such revised financial statements are delivered, the representations and warranties in _Section 3.5_, the covenants in _Sections 6.3(b)_ and _6.14_ , and (y) the conditions in _Section 7.2_ shall apply to such revised financial statements in the same manner as such previously delivered financial statements. 

   

 Section 6.19 _Indebtedness_. 

  

 (a) Except as provided in _Section 6.19(b)_, Sun shall use reasonable best efforts, and Horizon OP shall cooperate with Sun, to obtain, prior to the Closing, all consents, waivers, approvals or other documents from any lenders, trustees, agents and other applicable third parties that are required for the Specified Indebtedness to be assumed by Horizon OP, or remain in place at the applicable Acquired Entity. 

   

 (b) The Sun Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and Horizon OP and Sun shall cooperate with each other, to effect a consent solicitation seeking the consent described in  _Schedule 6.19(b)_, which consent shall be effective as of the Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the Horizon Parties, on the one hand, and the Sun Parties, on the other hand, shall furnish all information about itself and its business and operations and all financial information to the other parties as may be required to be included in the consent solicitation materials to be circulated by the Sun Parties, or any prospectus, registration statement or other materials or documents to be circulated, or filed with the SEC by, the Horizon Parties. The Sun Parties shall afford Horizon OP a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any applicable consent solicitation materials and shall, in good faith, take such comments into consideration. Each of Horizon, Sun and Trust promptly will notify the others if and to the extent that any information provided by it for use in any such materials or filings shall have 

    ##### 

  

 

become false or misleading in any material respect. Each of Horizon, Sun and
Trust will cooperate with the others to take all steps reasonably necessary
to amend or supplement such materials or filings, and, as applicable, to
cause such materials or filings, as amended or supplemented, to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the holders of SHC Indebtedness. Each of Horizon,
Sun and Trust represents and warrants that the information provided by it for
inclusion in such materials or filings, and each amendment or supplement
thereto, at the time of mailing thereof (in the case of any
consent solicitation materials or prospectus or similar documents) and at the
time it becomes effective (in the case of any registration statement filed
with the SEC) will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if the applicable consent described in this _Section 6.19(b)_ is
not obtained with respect to either tranche of SHC Indebtedness, or Horizon
OP otherwise notifies Sun prior to the mailing of the consent solicitation
materials that it elects to exclude the 2025 SHC Indebtedness, then such
tranche of SHC Indebtedness will be deemed not to be Specified Indebtedness
for any and all purposes of this Agreement, including  _Section 6.19(c)_ and
the definition of Retained Liabilities in _Section 10.1(mmm)_. 

   

 (c) At or prior to the Closing (or, with respect to any Deferred Asset, prior to the earlier of (i) the applicable Post-Closing Deferral Deadline and (ii) the applicable closing date, if any, under _Section 6.18(f)_), the Sun Parties shall, at the sole expense of Sun, pay, or cause to be paid, in full and cause to be terminated (or assumed by a Person other than an Acquired Entity) all Indebtedness of the Acquired Entities, and shall cause to be removed all Encumbrances on any of the Acquired Assets securing such Indebtedness, other than Specified Indebtedness. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Closing (or, with respect to any Deferred Asset, prior to the earlier of (i) the applicable Post-Closing Deferral Deadline and (ii) the applicable closing date, if any, under  _Section 6.18(f)_), the Sun Parties shall (x) use reasonable best efforts to avoid any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or any circumstance, condition or event that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or to the loss of a material benefit under any Specified Indebtedness and (y) upon obtaining Knowledge of any such violation, default or right, shall give prompt notice thereof to Horizon OP and shall cause such violation, default or right, and the circumstances, conditions or events giving rise to such violation, default or right, to be cured or prevented, as applicable. 

   

 Section 6.20 _Interest Total Certificate_. Promptly following the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date, Sun shall deliver to Horizon OP a certificate signed on behalf of Sun by the chief executive officer or chief financial officer of Sun, in such capacity, to the effect that (i) the number of Class B Shares set forth on such certificate will represent the precise Class B Share Total, (ii) the number of RP Units and Class A RP Units (each as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of SLT) set forth on such certificate will represent precisely the number of issued and outstanding RP Units and Class A RP Units, respectively, as of immediately prior to the Closing and (iii) no Interests in SLT (other than the RP Units and Class A RP Units identified pursuant to _clause (ii)_ ) will exist immediately prior to the Closing. Sun shall cause (i) the Class B Share Total to be identical 

   ##### 

  

    

to the amount identified as the Class B Share Total in the certificate
delivered pursuant to this _Section 6.20_, (ii) the number of RP Units and
Class A RP Units issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Closing to be identical to the number of RP Units and Class A RP Units
identified in the certificate to be delivered pursuant to this _Section 6.20_
and (iii) there to be no Interests in SLT (other than such RP Units and Class
A RP Units) as of immediately prior to the Closing. 

  

 Section 6.21 _Liquor Licenses_. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Horizon OP, at its sole cost and expense, shall make all necessary applications for, and shall thereafter diligently pursue, issuance of all licenses and approvals, if any, required under any Laws for the continued sale or service of alcoholic beverages at each Acquired Hotel from and after the Closing Date (including temporary permits, to the extent available) consistent with the practices and procedures in effect as of the date hereof (collectively, " _Liquor Licenses_ "). In respect of each Acquired Hotel located outside of the United States and Canada, if the Law and practices and procedures in effect as of the date of this Agreement require that the holder of a Liquor License be a Sun Affiliate (or an individual employee thereof) which is intended to operate such Acquired Hotel pursuant to an Operating Agreement or a Sublease Agreement, as applicable, Horizon OP and Sun shall consult and mutually agree on the appropriate licensee, which shall make all necessary applications for, and shall thereafter diligently pursue, issuance of such Liquor License. Each of Sun and Horizon OP shall keep the other informed of the status of such applications, and shall promptly respond to the others inquiries regarding the status of the same. If a Liquor License has not been issued with respect to any Acquired Hotel as of the Closing Date, then Sun shall, or shall cause the applicable Acquired Entity or Asset Seller to, or shall use commercially reasonable effort to cause the applicable operating manager of such Acquired Hotel to, as applicable, enter into an interim liquor agreement in all material respects in the form of  _Exhibit V_ (the " _Interim Liquor Agreement_ "); _provided_ that, the Interim Liquor Agreement for each Acquired Hotel shall be modified, prior to its execution, in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Horizon OP and Sun, to reflect applicable Law and local custom or practice. For the purposes of this _Section 6.21_, " _Closing Date_ " means, with respect to any Deferred Asset, the applicable closing date under _Section 6.18(f)_. Prior to, at and after the Closing, each of Sun and Horizon OP shall cooperate with the other in its efforts to obtain the issuances or transfers, as applicable, of the Liquor Licenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.22 _Sun Indenture_. The Sun Parties shall take all action necessary to ensure that (i) no Trust Assumption Event (as such term is defined in Section 11.21(b) of the Sun Indenture) shall occur and (ii) after the Closing, neither Horizon nor any Horizon Subsidiary (including any Acquired Entity) shall have any obligation with respect to the Sun Indenture. 

  

 Section 6.23 _Title Insurance and Surveys_. Sun, at no cost or expense to Sun other than _de minimis_ costs and expenses, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Horizon OP in Horizon OPs efforts to induce one or more title insurance companies (and, in respect to any Acquired Property located outside of the United States and Canada, registered legal counsel or notaries or other customary providers of title assurances, as appropriate for the respective jurisdiction) reasonably satisfactory to Horizon OP and its counsel, to issue a policy of title insurance or a date down endorsement for an existing policy of title insurance, or (with respect to any Acquired Property located outside of the United States and Canada), render a title 

   ##### 

  

    

opinion or title certificate or other customary evidence of title assurance,
as appropriate for the respective jurisdiction, showing good and indefeasible
title to such Acquired Property in fee simple or valid leasehold estate or
its respective equivalent, as the case may be, vested in the
applicable Acquired Entity or Directly Acquired Assets Owner as of the
Closing (each such policy or date down endorsement, or title opinion or title
certificate or other customary evidence of title assurance, as appropriate
for the respective jurisdiction, a " _Title Policy_ " and collectively the "
_Title Policies_ "), subject only to the Permitted Title Exceptions. Prior to
Closing, Sun, at no cost or expense to Sun other than _de minimis_ costs and
expenses, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Horizon
OP in any reasonable effort to remove Encumbrances from the Title Policies,
provided that Sun shall not be obligated to remove any such Encumbrances and
the removal of such Encumbrances shall not be a condition to Closing. Sun, at
no cost or expense to Sun other than _de minimis_ costs and expenses, shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Horizon OP if Horizon OP,
in its sole and absolute discretion, determines to request from one or more
title companies (and, with respect to any Acquired Property located outside
of the United States and Canada, registered surveyors or other licensed land
survey professionals, as appropriate and customary for the respective
jurisdiction) a new ALTA survey, or with respect to any Acquired Property
located outside of the United States and Canada, the customary survey
utilized in the relevant jurisdiction, or an update or recertification of
any existing survey reflecting the total area of the applicable Acquired
Property, the location of all improvements, recorded easements and
encroachments, if any, located thereon and all building and setback lines and
other matters of record typically reflected on a survey with respect thereto
and such matters as are customarily included in such surveys (the " _Surveys_
"). In connection with the foregoing, neither Sun nor any Sun Subsidiary
shall be required to execute or deliver any affidavits, indemnities or
similar documents to any title companies, surveyors or other third parties,
except that prior to or at the Closing, Sun shall execute and deliver or cause
any Sun Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the applicable title insurance
companies title affidavits in substantially the form set forth in _Schedule_
  _6.23_ (without, in any event, indemnification by Sun or any Sun Party). As
a condition to Suns obligation to deliver such attached affidavit, Horizon
agrees that it will date down each applicable title commitment or preliminary
date-down endorsement to a date that is as close as reasonably practicable to
the Closing Date, but in any event such date down shall not be dated
more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 6.24 _Rule 145 Affiliate Agreements_. Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, Trust shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Horizon OP a list identifying all Persons who, as of the Horizon Stockholders Meeting, may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Trust, in each case as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the " _Rule 145 Affiliates_"). Each of Sun and Trust shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Person who is identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in such list to deliver to Horizon OP at or prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time a written agreement executed by such Person, substantially in the form of _Exhibit W_. 

  

 Section 6.25 _Horizon Common Stock Transactions_. Without the prior written consent of Horizon OP, from the date hereof until the Closing, each Sun Party shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, directly, or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge, or otherwise dispose of, including through any hedging or derivative transactions or otherwise, any shares of Horizon Common Stock or Interests therein. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.26 _Sun Restructuring_. The Sun Parties shall, and shall cause the Sun Subsidiaries to, at or prior to the Closing, complete the Sun Restructuring Steps (and satisfy the Restructuring Parameters) in all respects in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Restructuring Plan. The parties to this Agreement shall amend the Restructuring Plan in accordance with any Plan Modifications. 

  

 Section 6.27 _Employment Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Employees_. Sun shall, and shall cause the Sun Subsidiaries to, take all necessary actions such that, immediately prior to the Closing, none of the Acquired Entities will employ any employees. 

   

 (b) _Employee Plans_.

 (d) _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, prior to Closing, if required by the provisions of the collective bargaining agreements in effect as of Closing at the Acquired Hotels identified as the "Sheraton Boston Hotel", "Sheraton Braintree", "Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers" and "W New York" on _Schedule 10.1(d)_, Sun shall take such action as is necessary in relation to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the terms of such collective bargaining agreements, including providing such notice as may be required to the applicable collective bargaining representatives of such Acquired Hotels, and Horizon OP or an appropriate Horizon Subsidiary shall agree to assume and be bound by and shall cause any successor to agree to assume and be bound by such collective bargaining agreements.

 (a) For purposes of this _Section 6.32_: 

    

 (i) " _Hotel EBITDA_ " means, with respect to any Acquired Hotel (other than the Sheraton Royal Denarau Resort), for any specified period, EBITDA calculated in a manner consistent with the accounting principles and practices applied by Sun in the preparation of its financial statements and adjusted to reflect (i) the fees under the License Agreements and the Operating Agreements and (ii) European regional costs historically charged to the related Acquired Hotels that will no longer be charged to such Acquired Hotels after the Closing Date. 

   

 (ii) " _Additional EBITDA Amount_ " means the annualized net amount of any increase in the aggregate amount of Hotel EBITDA of the Acquired Hotels (other than the Sheraton Royal Denarau Resort) as a result of any additional compensation to be paid to (or any reduction in the current allocation of costs and expenses currently paid by) such Acquired Hotels under the License Agreements and Operating Agreements relating to certain uses or activities currently engaged in by Sun and its Affiliates at certain of such Acquired Hotels, which uses and activities are more specifically identified as the "Affiliate Transactions" on Section 3.10 of the Sun Disclosure Letter, to the extent such uses or activities (i) do not currently reflect payment of arms 

   ##### 

  

    

length compensation, and/or (ii) are for corporate, regional or other
purposes not for the direct benefit of the subject Acquired Hotels, and/or
(iii) do not currently reflect appropriate allocations of costs and expenses
on a fair and consistent basis among all hotels or other parties benefiting
from such use or activities. The parties hereto shall use their reasonable
efforts to agree on appropriate amounts of additional compensation or
allocations of costs and expenses, as the case may be, for such disclosed
Affiliate Transactions no later than December 15, 2005. 

   

 (iii) " _Target EBITDA Amount_ " means the sum of the amounts set forth in the column titled "Target EBITDA Amount" opposite the name of each Acquired Hotel (other than the Sheraton Royal Denarau Resort) in _Schedule 6.32_.

 (b) Sun shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Horizon OP no later than January 31, 2006 (but in any event at least ten (10) business days prior to the Closing Date), a statement, based on the Operating Reports (as such term is defined in Article 10.2 of the form of Operating Agreement), that shall set forth Suns good faith calculation of the amount of the actual Hotel EBITDA for Operating Year 2005 for all Acquired Hotels (other than the Sheraton Royal Denarau Resort) (in the aggregate and on an individual hotel-by-hotel basis) (as so estimated, the " _Estimated EBITDA Amount_ "). If Horizon OP notifies Sun within fifteen (15) business days after receiving such statement, but in any event prior to the Closing Date, that it disagrees with the Estimated EBITDA Amount, the parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith to reach an agreement as to the Estimated EBITDA Amount and the Estimated EBITDA Amount will be revised to reflect such agreement, if any. In the event that the sum of (i) the Estimated EBITDA Amount (or, if known, the Actual EBITDA Amount) and (ii) the Additional EBITDA Amount is less than the Target EBITDA Amount, the aggregate amount of all Transfer Taxes and Transaction Costs up to the $50 million payable by Horizon OP and the Horizon Subsidiaries, in the aggregate, pursuant to _Section 8.3_ at Closing shall be decreased (the " _Reduction_ ") in an amount (but not by a number less than zero) equal to (I) the lesser of (x) the Target EBITDA Amount less the sum of the Estimated EBITDA Amount (or, if known, the Actual EBITDA Amount) plus the Additional EBITDA Amount and (y) the Target EBITDA Amount less the sum of the Revised EBITDA Amount plus the Additional EBITDA Amount _multiplied by_ (II) 12.8. 

   

 (c) In the event one or more Acquired Hotels or Acquired Entities is excluded from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements pursuant to _Section 6.18_ , the calculations set forth in _Section 6.32(b)_ shall be revised as follows: (i) the Estimated EBITDA Amount (or, if known, the Actual EBITDA Amount) associated with each such excluded Acquired Hotel or Acquired Entity shall be disregarded; (ii) the Target EBITDA Amount shall be reduced by the amount set forth in the column titled "Target EBITDA Amount" opposite the name of such Acquired Hotel in _Schedule 6.32_; and (iii) the Revised EBITDA 

    ##### 

  

 

Amount shall be reduced by the amount set forth in the column titled "Revised
EBITDA Amount" opposite the name of such Acquired Hotel in _Schedule 6.32_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such Acquired Hotel or Acquired Entity
is later acquired in accordance with this Agreement, the adjustments
calculated above shall be promptly revised and settled as if such acquisition
had taken place on the Closing Date. 

   

 (d) The procedure set forth in this _Section 6.32(d)_ shall be available upon request of either party made within 15 business days after the delivery by Horizon OP of a notice of disagreement pursuant to _Section 6.32(b)_. As promptly as practicable following the delivery of the 2005 Audited Financial Statements but in no event later than thirty (30) days thereafter, the parties shall use the supporting schedules thereto to calculate the amount of the actual Hotel EBITDA for Operating Year 2005 for all Acquired Hotels (other than the Sheraton Royal Denarau Resort) (in the aggregate and on an individual hotel-by-hotel basis) (the " _Actual EBITDA Amount_ "). In the event the Closing has already occurred, no more than five (5) business days after the determination of the Actual EBITDA Amount in accordance with this _Section 6.32(d)_, (i) if the Actual EBITDA Amount exceeds the Estimated EBITDA Amount, Horizon OP shall deliver to Sun, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a U.S. dollar amount equal to such difference (but no more than the lesser of (x) the amount of the Reduction and (y) the amount of the additional Transfer Taxes and Transaction Costs actually paid by Sun as a consequence of the application of the Reduction) and (ii) if the Estimated EBITDA Amount exceeds the Actual EBITDA Amount, Sun shall deliver to Horizon OP, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a U.S. dollar amount equal to such difference (up to the amount of Transfer Taxes and Transaction Costs that would not have been paid by Horizon had the Actual EBITDA Amount been applied instead of the Estimated EBITDA Amount), together with, in each case of _clause (i)_ and _(ii)_ , interest on such difference accrued at a variable rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by Citibank, N.A., at its principal office in New York, New York, as its annual base rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over 365, from the Closing Date to the date such amount is payable pursuant to this _Section 6.32(d)_.

 (b) _Condemnation Events_. If condemnation proceedings are commenced against any portion of an Acquired Hotel prior to the Closing (with respect to such Acquired Hotel, a "condemnation event") and such Acquired Hotel shall not be deemed an Excluded Asset pursuant to  _Section 6.18_, then (i) at the Closing or, in the case of a Deferred Asset, at the closing date under _Section 6.18_, (A) the applicable Acquired Entity or Directly Acquired Assets Owner shall receive the proceeds of the condemnation award then collected or received by Sun and the Sun Subsidiaries with respect to such condemnation event, less the amount of the actual and reasonable unreimbursed, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Sun and the Sun Subsidiaries in connection with any appeal of such award (it being understood that no Sun Party shall be under any obligation to appeal any such award) and (B) Sun shall, and shall cause the applicable Sun Subsidiaries to, assign its rights to all then unpaid condemnation proceeds with respect to such condemnation event to the applicable Acquired Entity or Directly Acquired Assets Owner (or such Acquired Entity or Directly Acquired Assets Owner shall become the substitute party thereto, if applicable) and (ii) Sun and the Sun Parties shall not, and shall not permit any Sun Subsidiary to, adjust or settle any condemnation award with respect to such condemnation event without the prior written consent of Horizon OP, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and Horizon OP shall be entitled to participate in all negotiations with third parties in respect of any such adjustment or settlement.

   ##### 

  

    

anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the foregoing shall not
require any Sun Party to pay over to any Horizon Party any funds in excess of
proceeds actually received by such Sun Party in respect of any
condemnation event. 

  

 Section 8.3 _Transaction Expenses_. 

  

 (a) Subject to _Section 8.3(b)_ and any other express allocation of expenses or other Losses in this Agreement, the Horizon Parties and the Sun Parties shall each pay their own legal, investment banking and other fees and expenses (including expenses of their respective Subsidiaries) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or the Horizon Transactions, whether or not any such transactions are consummated. 

  

 (b) Each party shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added stock transfer and stamp taxes, stamp duties, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees, charges, premiums and any similar taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (excluding the Ancillary Agreements) and the Local Purchase Agreements or the Horizon Transactions (together with any related interests, penalties or additions to tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ "). At and after the Closing, notwithstanding the language of any Local Purchase Agreement stating that a particular party thereto is to pay any amounts otherwise addressed by this _Section 8.3(b)_, Horizon OP and Sun each shall, or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, pay or cause to be paid an amount equal to 50% of the aggregate amount of (A) Transfer Taxes (which term shall not in any event be construed to include for these purposes any Tax imposed under the Code or any other income Tax) and (B) (i) any income taxes payable with respect to the transfer of Westin Indianapolis, Westin Cincinnati and Westin South Coast Plaza in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Horizon Transactions (including pursuant to Section 1374 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 337 of the Code), (ii) any Losses incurred in connection with obtaining consents, waivers or amendments from any Person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Local Purchase Agreements or the Horizon Transactions, including the net present value (using a 10% discount rate) of any future economic impact resulting in connection with such consents, waivers or amendments (all Losses described in this _clause (ii)_ , " _Consent Costs_ "), (iii) any Losses incurred in connection with severance or other similar payment obligations to employees in connection with the direct or indirect purchase by Horizon OP or any Horizon Subsidiary of any Acquired Hotels not located in the United States or the related Horizon Transactions, (iv) mortgage transfer costs or mortgage transfer expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Local Purchase Agreements or the Horizon Transactions, (v) costs associated with the defeasance of Suns CMBS Indebtedness, and (vi) any Losses (other than (A) the amount of any associated Adjusted Indebtedness included in the Final Adjustment and (B) any Losses expressly allocated to Sun or Horizon OP pursuant to  _Section 6.19_) incurred in connection with respect (x) the 7 3/8% debentures due November 15, 2015 issued by SHC (the " _2015 SHC Indebtedness_ ") or (y) the 7 3/4% debentures due November 15, 2025 issued by SHC (the " _2025 SHC Indebtedness_ " and, together with the 2015 SHC Indebtedness, the " _SHC Indebtedness_ "), in each case in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Horizon Transactions (the items described in _clause (B)_  

   ##### 

  

    

collectively, " _Transaction Costs_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in
no event shall the aggregate amount of all Transfer Taxes and Transaction
Costs payable by Horizon OP and the Horizon Subsidiaries, in the aggregate,
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ be greater than $50 million (other than with
respect to any Transaction Costs (included in _clause (iii)_ above) in
connection with the Sublease Agreements arising from the works council
review with respect to the Acquired Hotels in Italy and Spain, which
Transaction Costs shall not be subject to such limitation). At and after the
Closing, Sun shall be responsible for all Transfer Taxes and Transaction
Costs not payable by Horizon OP and the Horizon Subsidiaries pursuant to
this  _Section 8.3_. 

  

 (c) At and after the Closing, Sun shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, pay the aggregate amount of the costs of any non-imputation endorsements to the Title Policies to be issued to Horizon OP (or its Subsidiaries) by one or more title insurance companies at Closing;  _provided_ that, Sun shall not be obligated to pay in excess of $25,000 in the aggregate with respect thereto. Horizon OP shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, pay or cause to be paid an amount equal to (w) the aggregate amount of the premium for the Title Policies to be issued to Horizon OP (or its Subsidiaries) by one or more title insurance companies at Closing, (x) the aggregate amount of the costs of any endorsements, other than non-imputation endorsements, thereto, (y) the aggregate amount of the cost of the Surveys and (z) the fees for recording the deed conveying each Acquired Hotel to Horizon OP or its applicable Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the date-down endorsements to the Existing Title Policies with Stewart Title Guaranty Company (" _Stewart_ ") and LandAmerica (" _LandAmerica_ ") title insurance companies which Horizon OP contemplates receiving at Closing for the Acquired Hotels identified on  _Schedule 10.1(d)_ of the Merger Agreement as the "Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina" (Stewart), the "Sheraton Tucson Hotel and Suites" (LandAmerica), the "Sheraton Stamford Hotel" (LandAmerica), the "Capital Hill Suites DC" (LandAmerica) and the "Sheraton Providence Airport Hotel" (LandAmerica), to the extent Sun is unable to obtain the agreement of Stewart or LandAmerica to a form of title affidavit acceptable to Sun and otherwise sufficient for such title companies to provide Horizon OP with a non-imputation endorsement in connection with the foregoing date-down endorsements, then, to the extent Horizon OP obtains new title insurance policies (in lieu of such date-down endorsements), Sun shall at and after the Closing pay an amount toward the cost of such new title policies equal to the difference between (i) the actual premium cost of the basic title coverage (without endorsements) for the new title policies required and (ii) the premium cost that Horizon OP would otherwise have paid for the basic title coverage of the date-down endorsements (without endorsements), such amount not to the exceed, in the aggregate, the sum of $250,000. For purposes of this Agreement, the costs and fees set forth in this _Section 8.3(c)_ shall not be included in the Transaction Costs. 

  

 Section 8.4 _Closing Working Capital; Adjusted Indebtedness; Determination of Adjustments_. 

  

 (a) The aggregate purchase price for the Closing Transactions was determined on the assumption that, the sum of (i) the Working Capital of the Acquired Business at the Apportionment Time determined in accordance with _Schedule 8.4(a)_ (the " _Closing Working Capital_ "), (ii) the Adjusted Indebtedness at the Appointment Time, (iii) the Remaining Capital Budget Amount less the Qualified Capital Expenditure Amount (such difference, the " _Required Capital Expenditure Amount_ ") and (iv) the aggregate credits to the Acquired Entities and Directly Acquired Assets Owners under _Section 8.2_ (the " _Casualty Adjustment Amount_ ") would 

   ##### 

  

    

be negative $704 million. In the event that the Closing Working Capital, less
the Adjusted Indebtedness, less the Required Capital Expenditure Amount (such
net amount, the " _Closing Net Adjustment Amount_ "), is greater than
negative $704 million (the " _Stated Net Adjustment Amount_ ") (and for
the avoidance of doubt a Closing Net Adjustment Amount of negative $1.00 is
greater than a Closing Net Adjustment Amount of negative $2.00), the Cash
Amount shall be increased by the difference between the Closing Net
Adjustment Amount and the Stated Net Adjustment Amount, and in the event that
the Closing Net Adjustment Amount is less than the Stated Net Adjustment
Amount (and for the avoidance of doubt a Closing Net Adjustment Amount of
negative $2.00 is less than a Closing Net Adjustment Amount of negative
$1.00), the Cash Amount shall be decreased by the difference between the
Closing Net Adjustment Amount and the Stated Net Adjustment Amount. 

  

 (b) At least ten (10) business days prior to the Closing Date, Sun shall prepare in good faith and deliver to Horizon OP a statement, together with reasonable documentation supporting such estimated calculation (collectively, the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ "), that shall set forth Suns good faith calculation of (i) the Closing Working Capital (in the aggregate and on an individual Hotel-by-Hotel basis), (ii) the Adjusted Indebtedness (in the aggregate and on an individual Hotel-by-Hotel basis), (iii) the Required Capital Expenditure Amount (in the aggregate and on an individual Hotel-by-Hotel basis), (iv) the Casualty Adjustment Amount (in the aggregate and on an individual Hotel-by-Hotel basis) and (v) the Closing Net Adjustment Amount (as so estimated, the " _Estimated Adjustment Amount_ "). The Estimated Closing Statement shall be accompanied by a written certification of the controller of Sun (solely in his capacity as an officer of Sun) to the effect that the Estimated Closing Statement and the calculation of the Estimated Adjustment Amount have been prepared in good faith in accordance with the Closing Statement Principles and this _Article 8_. If Horizon OP notifies Sun, at least three (3) business days prior to the Closing Date, that it disagrees with the Estimated Adjustment Amount, the parties hereto shall cooperate in good faith to reach an agreement as to the Estimated Adjustment Amount and the amount of the Estimated Adjustment Amount will be revised to reflect any such agreement, if any. The Cash Amount payable by Horizon OP at Closing shall be (x) increased in the amount by which the Estimated Adjustment Amount exceeds the Stated Net Adjustment Amount or (y) decreased in the amount by which the Stated Net Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount, as applicable. 

  

 (c) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date but in no event later than ninety (90) days thereafter, Sun shall deliver to Horizon OP a statement, together with reasonable documentation supporting such calculation (collectively, the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ "), that shall set forth Suns calculation of (i) the Closing Working Capital (in the aggregate and on an individual Hotel-by-Hotel basis), (ii) the Adjusted Indebtedness (in the aggregate and on an individual Hotel-by-Hotel basis), (iii) the Required Capital Expenditure Amount (in the aggregate and on an individual Hotel-by-Hotel basis), (iv) the Casualty Adjustment Amount (in the aggregate and on an individual Hotel-by-Hotel basis) and (v) the Closing Net Adjustment Amount based on the Preliminary Closing Statement (the " _Preliminary Adjustment Amount_ "). 

  

 (d) Horizon OP shall have forty-five (45) days (unless Sun and Horizon OP mutually agree to an extension; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sun shall not unreasonably withhold its agreement to such an extension of an additional forty-five (45) days) following delivery to 

   ##### 

  

    

Horizon OP of the Preliminary Closing Statement and the calculation of the
Preliminary Adjustment Amount during which to review the Preliminary Closing
Statement and such calculations, and to notify Sun if it believes that (i)
the Preliminary Closing Statement was not prepared in accordance with
the Closing Statement Principles, as applicable, and this _Article 8_ (in
which case such notification shall be accompanied by a report of KPMG stating
that it concurs with Horizon OPs position that the Preliminary Closing
Statement was not prepared in accordance with the Closing Statement
Principles, as applicable, and this _Article 8_), (ii) the Preliminary
Closing Statement contains mathematical error or (iii) the calculation of the
Preliminary Adjustment was not in accordance with this _Article 8_. In
connection with such review, Horizon OP and its Representatives shall have
the right to communicate with EandY, and Sun shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause EandY to permit Horizon OP to review all work papers,
schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared or reviewed by Sun or EandY
during the course of its review, and such access shall be provided promptly
after request by Horizon OP or its Representatives;  _provided_ that, the
foregoing shall be subject to professional standards and EandYs firm policy,
which may include the requirement that Horizon OP and its Representatives sign
an "indemnification letter" in a form customarily accepted by EandY prior to
receiving access to any materials prepared by EandY. If Horizon OP fails to
properly notify Sun of any such dispute within such 45-day (or extended
period) period, the Preliminary Closing Statement and the calculation of the
Preliminary Adjustment Amount shall be deemed final. In the event that Horizon
OP shall so notify Sun of any dispute, Horizon OP and Sun shall cooperate in
good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as possible, and upon such
resolution, if any, any adjustments to the Preliminary Closing Statement and
the Preliminary Adjustment Amount shall be made in accordance with
the agreement of Horizon OP and Sun. 

  

 (e) If Horizon OP and Sun are unable to resolve any such dispute within fifteen (15) days (or such longer period as Horizon OP and Sun shall mutually agree in writing) of Horizon OPs delivery of such notice, such dispute shall be resolved by the accounting firm selected in the manner set forth below (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "), and such determination shall be final and binding on the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the calculation of the aggregate amount of adjustments to be made pursuant to this _Section 8.4_ (the " _Final Adjustment Amount_ ") shall be based on the Final Closing Statement and the definitions and terms contained herein and (ii) unless the Independent Accounting Firm determines that the Preliminary Closing Statement was not prepared in accordance with the Closing Statement Principles, as applicable, and this _Section 8.4_ or contains mathematical errors, the Preliminary Closing Statement shall be the Final Closing Statement. Sun and Horizon OP shall mutually select the Independent Accounting Firm, but if Sun and Horizon OP cannot mutually agree on the identity of the Independent Accounting Firm, then Sun and Horizon OP shall each submit to the other partys independent auditor the name of a national accounting firm other than EandY and KPMG, and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be selected by lot from these two firms by the independent auditors of the two parties. If no national accounting firm shall be willing to serve as the Independent Accounting Firm, then a nationally recognized (in the United States) expert in public accounting shall be selected to serve as such, such selection to be according to the above procedures. Any expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm in respect of its services pursuant to this _Section 8.4(e)_ shall be shared equally by Sun and Horizon OP. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use every commercially reasonable effort to perform its services within thirty (30) days of submission of the Preliminary Statement to it and, in any case, as promptly as practicable after such submission. The Final 

   ##### 

  

    

Closing Statement and the calculation of the Final Adjustment Amount shall
then be prepared by Sun based on the determination of the Independent
Accounting Firm. For purposes of this _Section 8.4(e)_, the " _Final Closing
Statement_ " shall mean (i) the Preliminary Closing Statement if deemed final
pursuant to _Section 8.4(d)_ or this _Section 8.4(e)_, (ii) any closing
statement deemed by mutual agreement of Sun and Horizon OP to be the Final
Closing Statement or (iii) the statement determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm to be the Final Closing Statement in accordance with this
_Section 8.4(e)_, whichever shall first occur. 

  

 (f) No more than five (5) business days after the determination of the Final Adjustment in accordance with _Section 8.4(e)_, (i) if the Estimated Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final Adjustment Amount, the Cash Amount shall be decreased by the amount of such difference, and Sun or the applicable Seller shall deliver to the applicable Horizon Parties (including the Acquired Entities and the Directly Acquired Assets Owners), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a U.S. dollar amount equal to such difference and (ii) if the Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount, the Cash Amount shall be increased by the amount of such difference, and the applicable Horizon Parties (including the Acquired Entities and the Directly Acquired Assets Owners) shall deliver to Sun or the applicable Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a U.S. dollar amount equal to such difference, together with, in each case of  _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , interest on such difference accrued at a variable rate equal to the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by Citibank, N.A., at its principal office in New York, New York, as its annual base rate, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over 365, from the Closing Date to the date such amount is payable pursuant to this  _Section 8.4(f)_ (and, thereafter, accrued at such annual base rate plus 3% per annum, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over 365). 

  

 (g) For the purposes of this _Section 8.4_, " _Adjusted Indebtedness_ " means all Indebtedness included in the Assumed Liabilities as of the Apportionment Time after giving effect to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to take place at or prior to the Closing and as determined in accordance with the Closing Statement Principles;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Adjusted Indebtedness shall not in any event include (A) any Retained Liabilities or (B) any amount of Indebtedness to the extent all rights to receive payment in respect of, and each other right with respect to, such amount is an Acquired Asset (except to the extent such rights are included in the Closing Working Capital) and (ii) the adjustments for Adjusted Indebtedness described in this _Section 8.4_ are not intended to be duplicative of any adjustments provided for elsewhere in this _Section 8.4_ and there shall be no double counting of adjustments. 

  

 (h) Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this _Section 8.4_, all adjustments shall be on an accrual basis in accordance with the Closing Statement Principles, and based on the actual number of days in the applicable period. 

  

 (i) All references to "Acquired Business" in this _Section 8.4_ shall mean the Acquired Business excluding any Deferred Assets, and Closing Working Capital as used in this _Section 8.4_ shall be deemed not to include Working Capital to the extent associated with any Deferred Asset. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (j) For purposes of determining the Closing Working Capital set forth on the Final Closing Statement, Sun and Horizon OP shall recalculate and readjust (in accordance with the Closing Statement Principles) any current Acquired Assets and current Assumed Liabilities (i) which were not included on the Estimated Closing Statement or Preliminary Closing Statement because of the unavailability of information or (ii) which were included on the Estimated Closing Statement or Preliminary Closing Statement based upon estimated information. The Closing Working Capital set forth on the Final Closing Statement shall be final and, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this _Article 8_, there shall be no further adjustment under this _Article 8_ between Sun and Horizon OP for Closing Working Capital; _provided_ , _however_ , if, after the determination of the Final Adjustment pursuant to _Section 8.4(e)_ but within 12 months of the Closing Date, the actual amount of any one or more of the items described in _clause (iii)_ above, individually or in the aggregate, is asserted in good faith by Horizon OP or Sun to vary from the amount reflected in the Final Adjustment by more than $500,000, the Final Adjustment shall be recalculated to equal the actual amount of such item, subject to determination as promptly as practicable thereafter in a manner consistent with the determination of the Final Adjustment, and the parties hereto shall promptly thereafter make the appropriate payments and adjustments to the Cash Amount.

   ##### 

  

    

has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service holding that
Horizons receipt of the additional amount otherwise to be paid under
_Section 9.2_ either would constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded
from gross income of Horizon for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code, the aggregate payments otherwise required to be made under this
Agreement (determined without regard to this  _Section 9.3_) less the amount
otherwise previously paid under _clauses (a)_ and  _(b)_ above. The
obligation of Sun to pay any unpaid portion of any payment otherwise required
under this Agreement that remains unpaid solely by reason of this _Section
9.3_ shall terminate five years from the date such payment otherwise would
have been made but for this  _Section 9.3_. Sun shall place the full amount
of any payments otherwise to be made by Sun to Horizon OP under _Section
9.2_ in a mutually agreed escrow account upon mutually acceptable terms which
shall provide that any portion thereof shall not be released to Horizon
OP unless and until Sun receives any of the following: (x) a letter from
Horizons independent tax accountants indicating the amount that it is
estimated can be paid at that time to Horizon OP without creating a risk that
the payment would cause Horizon to fail to meet the Specified
REIT Requirements (as such term is defined in the Tax Sharing and
Indemnification Agreement) for the taxable year in which the payment would be
made, which determination shall be made by such independent tax accountants,
(y) an Alternative Tax Letter or (z) an opinion of outside tax
counsel selected by Horizon, which such opinion shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Horizon, to the effect that, based upon a change in law after
the date on which payment was first deferred hereunder, receipt of the
additional amount otherwise to be paid under this Agreement either would be
excluded from gross income of Horizon for purposes of the Specified REIT
Requirements or would constitute Qualifying Income, in any of which events
Sun shall pay to Horizon OP the lesser of the unpaid amounts due under this
Agreement (determined without regard to this _Section 9.3_) or the maximum
amount stated in the letter referred to in _clause (x)_ above. At the end of
the five year period referred to above in this _Section 9.3_ with respect to
any amount placed in such escrow, if none of the events referred to in
_clauses (x)_ , _(y)_ or _(z)_  of the preceding sentence shall have
occurred, such amount shall be released from such escrow to be used as
determined by Sun in its sole and absolute discretion. 

  

 Section 9.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto in writing by action of the Board of Directors of Horizon (or any duly constituted committee thereof with proper authority as to such matters), the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the Board of Directors of Sun (or any duly constituted committee thereof with proper authority as to such matters).
