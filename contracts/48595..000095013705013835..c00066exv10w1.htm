in a form and have such other provisions as Horizon OP and Sun may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the REIT Merger

with any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to <U>Section
1.9(d)</U> and cash, if any, payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to <U>Section

by the Exchange Agent, (i)&nbsp;the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the REIT Merger Consideration into which Class&nbsp;A EPS or Class&nbsp;B Shares theretofore

<U>Section&nbsp;1.9(d)</U> and cash, if any, payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
<U>Section&nbsp;1.9(g)</U> and, in the case of Certificates for Paired Shares, a certificate
representing the number of shares of Sun Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Sun Common

Share Amount</U>&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;Horizon OP and Sun shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Exchange Agent to mail (or make available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering
holder) such amount to such holder within five (5)&nbsp;business days after receipt thereof and (iii)
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Class&nbsp;A EPS or Paired Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of Sun or
Trust, as applicable, payment of the REIT Merger Consideration or issuance of the Sun Common Share
Amount, as applicable, may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment or issuance either shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of such payment or issuance being made to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Sun or Horizon
OP, as applicable, that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;1.9</U>, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
