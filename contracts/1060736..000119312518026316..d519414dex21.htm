Page 1 ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ , Merger Sub shall, as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement and, in any event,
by 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on February 8, 2018 (subject to the Company
having timely provided any information required to be provided by it pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 1.1(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.2(b)_), commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of
the Shares at a price per share equal to the Offer Price. The obligations of
Merger Sub to (and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to) accept for payment and to
pay for any Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to
the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) of those conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_
(collectively, the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "). The Company agrees that no
Shares held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than any such
Shares held on behalf of third parties) will be tendered pursuant to the
Offer.

 

(b) _Waiver of Tender Offer Conditions_. Merger Sub expressly reserves the
right from time to time, in its sole discretion, to (1) waive any Tender
Offer Condition, (2) increase the Offer Price and (3) make any other changes
in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger
Sub shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, which
consent may be granted or withheld by the Company in its sole discretion, (i)
decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (iii) decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in the
Offer, (iv) amend, modify or waive satisfaction of the Minimum Condition or
the Regulatory Condition, (v) amend or modify any of the other Tender Offer
Conditions in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares in their capacity as
such, (vi) impose conditions to the Offer in addition to the Tender Offer
Conditions, (vii) terminate the Offer (other than in connection with the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_ ) or accelerate,
extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date in a manner other than pursuant
to and in accordance with this Agreement or (viii) amend, modify or supplement
any other term of the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares in
their capacity as such.

(c) _Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement
Date, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file or cause to be filed with the SEC
a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together
with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ")
and the related offer to purchase, letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents and instruments pursuant to
which the Offer will be made (collectively, and including any supplements or
amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to the Companys stockholders as and to the
extent required by the applicable U.S. federal securities Laws and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder (collectively, the " _Securities Laws_
"). Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to (A)
comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable
Securities Laws and (B) not contain any

 



Page 2  untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to any
information contained or incorporated by reference in any Offer Document that
was furnished or provided by the Company. The Company agrees to furnish
promptly to Parent all information concerning the Company required by the
Securities Laws to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Subject to _Section_
__ _ 5.6_, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the Company Board Recommendation. Each party agrees to correct or
supplement promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or such amendment or supplement shall
become necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and Parent and
Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
TO, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer
Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, in each case, as and to the extent required by the Securities
Laws. Unless the Company Board has effected a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, Parent will provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Offer Documents, and any amendments or supplements thereto,
before they are filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, and Parent shall give good faith consideration to all the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company.
Parent shall respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments
received from the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents and provide copies
of such comments to the Company promptly upon receipt and provide copies of
proposed responses to the Company a reasonable time prior to filing with the
SEC and dissemination to the Companys stockholders to allow the Company a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment, and Parent shall give good faith
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company.

(d) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the
twentieth business day (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and
Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) following the Offer Commencement Date
(the initial expiration date, or such subsequent date to which the expiration
of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ (and
subject to the Companys and Parents respective rights to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Article VII_ ), (i) Merger Sub shall extend the
Offer and the Expiration Date for any period required by the Securities Laws,
the interpretations and positions of the SEC and its staff with respect
thereto or the rules and regulations of NASDAQ applicable to the Offer or as
may be required by any other Governmental Authority, and (ii) if at any
scheduled Expiration Date the Tender Offer Conditions shall not have been
satisfied or earlier waived by Parent or Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall (and
shall be permitted to) extend the Offer and the Expiration Date on one or more
occasions, in consecutive increments, up to ten (10) Business Days each after
such previously scheduled Expiration Date (or such longer period as Parent
and the Company may agree) to permit such Tender Offer Condition to be
satisfied; _provided_ , that if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, the
sole unsatisfied Tender Offer Condition (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Acceptance Time and the condition with
respect to the delivery of certificates referenced in _paragraph (5)_ of
_Exhibit A_ ) is the Minimum Condition, 

 



Page 3  Merger Sub shall only be required (but shall have the right in its sole
discretion) to extend the Offer and the Expiration Date for a single period
equal to the shorter of (A) twenty (20) Business Days and (B) the number of
Business Days remaining prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Merger Sub shall in no event be required to extend the Offer and the
Expiration Date to a date later than the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with to _Article VII_ and the Outside Date.

 

(e) _Termination of Offer_. Merger Sub shall not terminate or withdraw the
Offer without the prior written consent of the Company other than in
connection with the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article
VII_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.1_ shall be deemed to impair, limit or
otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent or Merger Sub to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VII_. In the event this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VII_ prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date, Merger Sub shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours
of such termination) irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer
without accepting any Shares previously tendered. If the Offer is terminated
by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated prior to purchase of Shares in
the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary
acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Law,
all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

 

(f) _Acceptance of and Payment for Shares_. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and to the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub
of the Tender Offer Conditions as of the Expiration Date in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(b)_, Merger Sub shall promptly on or after the Expiration
Date accept for payment (such time of acceptance for payment, the "
_Acceptance Time_ ") and promptly (and in any event within three business days
(calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act)) pay for
all Shares validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer
(such time of payment, the " _Offer Consummation Time_ "). Without limiting
the generality of _Section_ __ _ 8.11_, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
have on a timely basis all funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger
Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause
Merger Sub to perform, on a timely basis, all of Merger Subs obligations
under this Agreement.

(g) _Withholding_. Merger Sub and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the
Offer to any of the Companys stockholders such amounts as Merger Sub or the
Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares,
Restricted Stock Units or Options, as the case may be, in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Merger Sub or the Paying Agent.

 

(h) _Notices of Guaranteed Delivery_. For purposes of this Agreement, and
the Offer, unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Company and Merger Sub,
any Shares subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to be
validly tendered into the Offer unless and until the Shares underlying such
notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered to or on behalf of Merger Sub.

 



Page 4 Section 1.2 _Company Action_.

 

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. The Company shall file with the SEC as promptly
as practicable on the date on which Parent and Merger Sub file the Offer
Documents with the SEC, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, and including the exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_"), which
shall, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, include the Company Board
Recommendation, and which shall include the fairness opinion of the Company
Financial Advisor referenced in _Section_ __ _ 2.21_ and shall disseminate
the Schedule 14D-9 to its stockholders, in each case, as and to the extent
required by the Securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub agree to furnish
promptly to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub
required by Securities Laws to be set forth in Schedule 14D-9. The Company
agrees promptly to correct the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it
shall become false or misleading in any material respect (and each of Parent
and Merger Sub, with respect to information supplied by it specifically for
use in the Schedule 14D-9, shall promptly notify the Company of any required
corrections of such information and cooperate with the Company with respect
to correcting such information) and to supplement the information contained in
the Schedule 14D-9 to include any information that shall become necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, and the Company further agrees to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to its stockholders as and to the extent required by the
Securities Laws. Unless the Company Board has effected a Company Adverse
Change Recommendation, Parent shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments or supplements
thereto before they are filed with the SEC or disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, and the Company shall give good faith consideration to all
the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent.
The Company shall respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
comments received from the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and shall
provide copies of such comments to Parent promptly upon receipt, shall provide
copies of proposed responses to Parent a reasonable time prior to filing with
the SEC and dissemination to the Companys stockholders to allow Parent
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment and shall give good faith
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent.

 

(b) _Stockholder Information_. In connection with the Offer, promptly
following the date of this Agreement the Company shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to Parent mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all
of its stockholders of record, a non-objecting beneficial owners list and
security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a
recent date, and shall promptly furnish Parent with such additional
information, including updated lists of stockholders and beneficial owners,
mailing labels, security position listings and computer files, and such other
information and assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably request for
the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record holders and beneficial
owners of Shares. In addition, in connection with the Offer the Company
shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause third
parties to, cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub to disseminate the Offer
Documents to the holders of Shares held in or subject to the Stock Plans or
ESPP and to permit such holders of Shares to tender their Shares into the
Offer. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to 

 



Page 5  consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub and their agents
(i) shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels,
listings and files and will use such information only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and (ii) following the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VII_ , shall promptly, at the election of Parent,
deliver to the Company or destroy, and will use their reasonable best efforts
to cause their agents to deliver to the Company or destroy, all copies and any
extract or summaries of such information then in their possession or control
and promptly certify to the Company in writing that all such material has
been returned or destroyed.

(c) _Share Registry_. The Company shall register (and shall instruct its
transfer agent to register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by
Merger Sub effective immediately after the Acceptance Time.

forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware, as amended (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company, and the separate corporate

Company, with all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the

Bylaws and applicable Law. The parties shall take all necessary action such
that the officers of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time shall
be, from and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Surviving
Corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Surviving Charter, the Surviving Bylaws and applicable Law.

Section 1.7 _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of shares of the capital stock of Merger
Sub, each share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and
become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.8 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares
owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii)
Shares that are owned by Dissenting Stockholders (each Share referred to in
_clause (i)_ or _clause (ii)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 1.8_ _(a)_ being an "
_Excluded Share_ " and, collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer
Price, without interest thereon (the "Per Share Merger Consideration"). At
the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")
formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and each
non-certificated Share represented by book-entry (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ")
(other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, and each
Certificate formerly representing Shares, and each Book-Entry Share, owned by
Dissenting Stockholders shall thereafter only represent the right to receive
the payment to which reference is made in  _Section_ __ _ 1.12_.

(b) _Treatment of Excluded Shares_. Each Share that is an Excluded Share
pursuant to _clause (ii)_ of the definition thereof, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration
therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof
may have under _Section_ __ _ 1.12_. Each Share that is an Excluded Share
pursuant to _clause (i)_ of the definition thereof shall remain outstanding
and shall be unaffected by the Merger.

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



Page 7 (d) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding Company Stock shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange, merger, consolidation
or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, or any similar transaction or event, the Offer Price and
the Per Share Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as
the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Shares
the same economic effect as contemplated prior to such event; _provided_ that
nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 1.8(d)_ shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any of the foregoing actions with respect to the Shares or
Company Stock to the extent otherwise prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement, including _Section_ __ _ 4.1(b)(vii)_.

 

Section 1.9 _Treatment of Company Preferred Stock_. Each share of Company
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and all rights in respect thereof, shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder thereof, automatically become a
share of the corresponding series of preferred stock of the Surviving
Corporation. To the extent necessary to effectuate the foregoing sentence, the
Surviving Corporation shall file a new certificate of designation for each
series of Company Preferred Stock, with the same terms and conditions, and
issue to the holders of such shares of Company Preferred Stock shares of
preferred stock of the Surviving Corporation evidencing such holders right to
convert such Company Preferred Stock into Alternate Consideration (as defined
in the Certificate of Designation of the applicable series of Company
Preferred Stock).

Section 1.10 _Treatment of Warrants_. Each 2013 Warrant issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, and all rights in
respect thereof, shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Acceptance Time and
without any action on the part of any holder thereof, remain a warrant of the
Company pursuant to the terms of the 2013 Warrant Agreement evidencing such
holders right to exercise such 2013 Warrant for such consideration as is
provided in the 2013 Warrant Agreement.

 

Section 1.11 _Equity-Based Compensation Plans and Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Acceptance Time, each outstanding
Option, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof, terminate and be cancelled
and converted into only the right to receive (without interest) an amount in
cash (less applicable Tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of (A) the Offer Price over (B) the exercise price per share
of such Option, and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Option
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time; provided, for the avoidance
of doubt, that no cash amount shall be payable with respect to an Option that
has a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Offer
Price, and such Option shall be cancelled and terminated without any payment
or delivery being made in respect thereof. Following the Acceptance Time, no
Option that was outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall
remain outstanding and each former holder of an Option shall have no further
rights with respect thereto, except to receive the consideration (if any) set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 1.11(a)_ in exchange for such Option in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.11(a)_. The Offer 

 



Page 8  Price (if any) payable under this _Section_ __ _ 1.11(a)_ to each former
holder of an Option that was outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance
Time shall be paid through the Surviving Corporations payroll to such former
holder as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time (but in any event
not later than the second payroll cycle thereafter), net of any Taxes withheld
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.13(f)_.

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. At the Acceptance Time, (A)
any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding Restricted Stock Unit
shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, accelerate in full, and (B) each Restricted Stock Unit
shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof, terminate and be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder
of such Restricted Stock Unit to receive (without interest) an amount in cash
(less applicable Tax withholding) equal to (x) the number of Shares subject
to such Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Acceptance Time
multiplied by (y) the Offer Price. Following the Acceptance Time, no
Restricted Stock Unit that was outstanding immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time shall remain outstanding and each former holder of a
Restricted Stock Unit shall have no further rights with respect thereto,
except to receive the consideration set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
1.11(b)_ in exchange for such Restricted Stock Unit in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 1.11(b)_. The Offer Price payable under this _Section_ __ _
1.11(b)_ to each former holder of a Restricted Stock Unit that was
outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall be paid through the
Surviving Corporations payroll to such former holder as soon as practicable
following the Acceptance Time (but in any event not later than the second
payroll cycle thereafter), net of any Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 1.13(f)_; _provided_ that, with respect to any Restricted Stock Unit that
constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code and that is not permitted to be paid at the Acceptance Time without
triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall
be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable Stock Plan and
award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of
the Code.

 

(c) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall cause no further offering periods to commence
under the ESPP and shall adopt any necessary or applicable amendment or
resolution, to (i) prohibit new participants from participating in the ESPP
and prohibit participants in the ESPP from increasing their
payroll deductions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement, (ii)
provide that no offering period shall be commenced after the date of this
Agreement, (iii) ensure that the applicable purchase price for shares of
Company Common Stock shall not be decreased below the levels set forth in the
ESPP as of the date of this Agreement, (iv) provide that each participants
outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the ESPP
shall be suspended immediately following the end of the current offering
period thereunder (the " _Current Offering Period_ ") or if earlier, each
participants outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
under the ESPP shall terminate on the day that is seven Business Days
immediately prior to the day on which the Acceptance Time occurs; _provided_
that, in either case, all amounts allocated to each participants account
under the ESPP as of such date shall thereupon be used to purchase from the
Company shares of Company Common Stock at the applicable price for the Current
Offering Period and such shares of Company Common Stock shall be subject to
the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 1.8_; and (v) the ESPP shall terminate in
its entirety at the Acceptance Time and no further rights shall be granted or
exercised under the ESPP thereafter.

 



Page 9 (d) _Plan Matters_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, and in any event at or prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company and the Company Board (and any subcommittee thereof), as applicable,
shall take any such action as may be necessary or desirable to give effect to
the treatment of the Options, Restricted Stock Units and the ESPP pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ and to cause each of the Stock Plans to be
terminated immediately prior to or as of the Effective Time. The Company shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any
Person pursuant to or in settlement of Options, Restricted Stock Units or any
other equity-based compensation awards. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Options
after the Effective Time.

 

Section 1.12 _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a
stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "), shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment
of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until
such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right, such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be deemed
to be Dissenting Shares and shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted into the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share
Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in
accordance with the terms hereof, without any interest thereon. The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of
any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable law that are received
by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal, and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such
demand for payment.

Section 1.13 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for

 



Page 10  the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance
with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 1.13_. Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to deposited, with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time,
the cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 1.8(a)_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall, pending its
disbursement to such holders, be invested in Specified Securities by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that no gain or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable hereunder and Parent shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash
sufficient to satisfy Parents obligation under this Agreement. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such amounts on
deposit with the Paying Agent will be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise
directs, and no part of such net profits shall accrue to the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was a holder of record of shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, whose shares of
Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.8_: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form for use in effecting the surrender
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (which transmittal letter shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent); and
(ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate or a Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.13(e)_) or Book-Entry Share, net
of applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.13(f)_, and the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall then be cancelled. If
payment of any Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate(s) formerly
representing shares of Company Common Stock are registered in the transfer
records of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that such
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Payment of the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall be made only to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 1.13_, subject to the rights of holders of Dissenting Shares,
each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at all times from and
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Per Share Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the
right to receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 1.8_. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article I_.

 



Page 11 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. The Per Share
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article I_ shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and the Surviving Corporation shall not
permit any further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in immediately
available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled as provided in this
_Article I_ , except as otherwise provided by Law.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock at any time
following the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered
to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
(other than holders of Excluded Shares) who have not theretofore complied with
this _Article I_ shall thereafter only be entitled to receive from Parent and
the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws, as general creditors thereof) payment of their claim for Per Share
Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.13(f)_). None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock at the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any public official shall become, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 

(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by
Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the
Exchange Fund pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.13(d)_, Parent) shall issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the
amount equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, net of
applicable Taxes withheld pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.13(f)_.

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
the Paying Agent and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts,
if any, as Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or
the Company are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or the Company, such amount shall be 

 



Page 12  (i) paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority; and (ii) treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of the
shares of Company Common Stock, Options or Restricted Stock Units, as the
case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent or the Company.

 

Section 1.14 _Further Action_. If at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of either of Merger Sub or the
Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully
authorized in the name of each of Merger Sub and the Company, or otherwise, to
take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action.

Section 2.3 _Authorization; No Conflict_ _; Voting Requirements_.

 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has
taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and, assuming that the
Transactions are consummated in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, to
consummate the Transactions. No other corporate action on the part of the
Company is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement or the consummation by it of the Transactions, subject only, in
the case of consummation of the Transactions (assuming that the Transactions
are consummated in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL), to filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware. If the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section 251(h) of
the DGCL as contemplated hereby, no vote of the Companys stockholders or any
holder of Company Securities is required to authorize or adopt this Agreement
or to consummate the Transactions. If the Merger were instead consummated in
accordance with 251(c) of the DGCL (which is not contemplated hereby), the
affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at a stockholders meeting in favor
of the adoption of this Agreement would be sufficient to adopt this Agreement
in accordance with applicable Law and the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws
and any other Organizational Documents of the Company, and no other approval
or consent of any holder of Company Securities would be required for the
Company to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement
or to consummate the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery hereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
and other similar Laws of general application affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and (ii) is subject to general
principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity
(the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company,
nor the performance or consummation by the Company of the Transactions will,
(i) result in a violation or breach of or conflict with the Certificate of
Incorporation, Bylaws or any other Organizational Documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) result in a modification, violation or breach
of, increased liability under or conflict with any provisions of, or result in
the loss of any material benefit under or constitute a default (or an event
that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default)
under, or result in the termination or cancellation of, or give rise to a
right of purchase (including pursuant to any right of first refusal or the
like) under, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right
of termination or acceleration under, or result in the creation of any Lien
(other than a Permitted Lien) upon, any of the properties, rights or assets
owned or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any Company Material Contract; or (iii)
subject to obtaining the Consents referred to in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(_ _c)_ ,
violate any judgment, ruling,

 



Page 17  order, writ, injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority ("
_Judgment_ ") or any statute, code, decree, law, ordinance, rule, regulation
or order of any Governmental Authority (" _Law_ "), in each case applicable
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets, other than, with respect to the events described in the
foregoing _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_  and, as individually or in the
aggregate, has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) No Consent with or of any United States federal, state or local
governmental, quasi-governmental or regulatory authority, court, body or
instrumentality or any governmental, quasi-governmental or regulatory
authority, court, body or instrumentality outside of the United States (each,
a " _Governmental Authority_ ") or any stock market or stock exchange on
which shares of Company Common Stock are listed for trading or under any Law
is necessary to be obtained or made by the Company in connection with the
Companys execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by
the Company of the Transactions, except for (i) filings required under, and
compliance with other applicable requirements of, the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, including the filing and dissemination of the Offer Documents
and Schedule 14D-9, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and appropriate corresponding
documents with the appropriate authorities of other states or jurisdictions
in which the Company and its Subsidiaries are qualified to transact business;
(iii) such Consents as may be required to comply with the rules of NASDAQ;
(iv) such Consents as may be required under any applicable foreign or state
securities, "blue sky" or takeover law; (v) such Consents as may be required
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the " _HSR
Act_ ") and under any Other Antitrust Laws; (vi) the other Consents with
or of Governmental Authorities set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter; and (vii) such other Consents which, if not
obtained or made, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(d) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, duly adopted
resolutions unanimously (i) determining that the Transactions, including the
Offer and the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders, (ii) approving this Agreement and declaring it advisable,
(iii) approving the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, including the Offer and
the Merger, (iv) resolving that the Merger shall be effected under Section
251(h) of the DGCL, and (v) recommended that the stockholders of the Company
accept the Offer and tender their Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer,
which resolutions, as of the date of this Agreement, have not been rescinded,
modified or withdrawn in any way.

 

(e) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent
and Merger Sub set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 3.7_, (i) the Company Board has
taken all action necessary so that Parent will not be an "interested
stockholder" or prohibited from entering into or consummating a "business
combination" with the Company (in each case as such term is used in Section
203 of the DGCL) as a result of execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions in the manner contemplated hereby and (ii) no
"fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business
combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including
Section 203 of the DGCL) enacted under any applicable Law (" _Takeover Laws_
") is applicable to Parent, the Company, the Company Securities, this
Agreement, or the Transactions.

Reports contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, in each case giving effect to any amendments

unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand), or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated
by the SEC), where the intended results, purpose or effect of such
Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material

(as defined in Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the

Exchange Act) in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting.

internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of

reimbursement, of the Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
of the Transactions will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any
additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any Stock Plan that

Company Intellectual Property is subject to any pending or outstanding
injunction, order, judgment, settlement, consent, covenant not to sue, ruling
or other disposition of dispute that adversely restricts the use, licensing,

such Company Intellectual Property.

reasonable steps to maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of all material

of the Company, has been disclosed to any of the Companys or its
Subsidiaries past or present employees or any third person, in each
case other than pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement restricting the
disclosure and use of such Trade Secret.

 

(h) To the Knowledge of the Company, no funding, facilities or personnel of
any Governmental Authority or any university, college, research institute or
other educational institution has been or is being used in any material
respect to create, in whole or in part, any material Company Intellectual
Property, except for any such funding or use of facilities or personnel that
does not result in such Governmental Authority or educational institution
obtaining ownership of, or use rights to, such Company Intellectual Property,
and does not require or otherwise obligate the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to grant or offer to any such Governmental Authority or
educational institution any license or other right to such Company
Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of the Company, no current or former

ARTICLE V

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 5.1 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates
to, provide to each Continuing Company Employee, in amounts no less favorable
in the aggregate than those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to
such employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) a salary or
hourly wage, (ii) a short-term (annual or more frequent) target bonus
opportunity, and (iii) benefits (including any profit sharing plans, bonus
plans, severance plans and health and welfare benefit plans).
Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, each Continuing Company Employee
whose employment is terminated by Parent or its Subsidiaries without cause
during the one (1) year period immediately following the Closing Date with
severance benefits on the terms and conditions and at the levels set forth in
the Companys Severance Benefit Plan, determined (A) without taking into
account any reduction after the Closing in compensation paid to such
Continuing Company Employee and (B) by taking into account each Continuing
Company Employees service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any
predecessor entities) and, after the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, after the Effective
Time, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(a)_ shall preclude the Surviving
Corporation from terminating the employment of any Continuing Company
Employee for any lawful reason.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor all Employee Benefit Plans of the Company
set forth on _Section_ __ _ 2.10(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
(excluding the Stock Plans and the ESPP to be terminated at or prior to the
Effective Time in accordance herewith), in each case in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time; _provided_ , that
this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_ shall not prevent the amendment or termination
of any specific Employee Benefit Plan or Contract in accordance with the terms
thereof.

(c) For purposes of vesting, participation, and eligibility to participate
under any similar employee benefit plans of Parent providing benefits to any
Continuing Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "),
Parent shall use commercially reasonable

 



Page 47  efforts to give each Continuing Company Employee credit for his or her years
of service with the Company and its predecessors before the Effective Time, as
if such service had been performed with Parent; _provided_ that the foregoing
shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits or for purposes of benefit accrual. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (i) to cause each Continuing Company Employee
to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any
New Plans, except to the extent any waiting period in effect under
the comparable Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Company
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time would not have
been satisfied; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision or disability benefits to any Continuing
Company Employee, (A) to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Company Employee and his or her covered dependents and (B) to cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Company Employee and his or
her covered dependents under an Employee Benefit Plan during the portion of
the plan year prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such
New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had
been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent in writing, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the applicable plan or
arrangement, the Company shall cause the Companys 401(k) Plan (the " _Company
401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time. In the event that Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan be
terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Plan has
been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review
and approval by Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time and thereafter (as applicable), the Company
and Parent shall take any and all actions as may be required, including
amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan and/or the tax-qualified defined
contribution retirement plan designated by Parent (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_
") to (1) permit each Continuing Company Employee to make rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code in the form of cash, shares of Parent common
stock or a combination thereof, in an amount equal to the full account balance
distributed or distributable to such Continuing Company Employee from the
Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan, and (2) obtain from the IRS a
favorable determination letter on termination for the Company 401(k) Plan.
Each Continuing Company Employee shall become a participant in the Parent
401(k) Plan on the Closing Date (giving effect to the service crediting
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 5.1(c)_); it being agreed that there shall be
no gap in participation in a tax-qualified defined contribution plan.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall, or be construed so as to (i) modify or
amend any Employee Benefit Plan, New Plan or other similar agreement, plan,
program, or document, or (ii) obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company following the Effective Time) to adopt or maintain any
particular plan or program or other compensatory or benefits arrangement at
any time or prevent Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the

 



Page 48  Company following the Effective Time) from modifying or terminating any such
plan, program or other compensatory or benefits arrangement at any time.
Without limiting the generality of  _Section_ __ _ 8.6_, nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_ shall be construed as giving any Person (including any
Company Employee or dependent or beneficiary thereof) other than the parties
to this Agreement any right (including any third party beneficiary right),
remedy or claim under or in respect of this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, including
any right with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment
and/or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Company Employee by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or under any
benefit plan which Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates may maintain.

 

(g) Prior to making any written or oral communications to the employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation or benefit
matters that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication,
Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication, and the Company shall consider any such comments in good faith.

 

Section 5.2 _Public Statements_. The parties shall issue a joint press
release, mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent, promptly upon
execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company
agrees that, from and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, the parties shall not issue any press release or make any public
statement concerning the Transactions without the other partys prior consent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) a party may, without complying with the
foregoing obligations, make any public statement in response to questions
from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences,
make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in Company SEC
Reports, to the extent that such statements are consistent with previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the parties
or otherwise in compliance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_; (b) a party may,
without complying with the foregoing obligations, after consultation with the
other party, issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement or statement where such party shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that such disclosure is
required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of NASDAQ or other national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service or by the request of any Governmental Authority;
and (c) the Company need not comply with the foregoing obligations in
connection with any press release, public statement or filing to be issued or
made with respect to any Takeover Proposal (including any "stop, look, and
listen" release) or a Company Adverse Change Recommendation.

 

Section 5.3 _Antitrust Law and Other Consents; Further Actions_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to use) reasonable best efforts to take, or

required to be obtained from such party in connection with the Offer and the
Merger in order to consummate the Transactions; _provided_ , that in no event
will the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries be obligated
to (and in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, without
Parents prior written consent) pay or commit to pay, whether prior to or
after the Acceptance Time, any fee, penalty or other consideration to any
third party to obtain any Consent or waiver pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.3_. The Company and Parent will consult and cooperate with one another, and

(c) Subject to applicable Laws, each of Parent and the Company will
promptly furnish outside legal counsel for the other (i) all necessary

facilities, books, records, contracts and other assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as Parent shall reasonably request so long as such access does
not unreasonably interfere with the

 



Page 52  conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and shall
furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such other data and information as Parent

Representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _

not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments or (ii) require the Company
or any of the Companys Subsidiaries to disclose any information concerning a

5.6(a)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) stating and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant
to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act, including a "stop, look and listen" statement
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any other
legally required disclosure to the Companys stockholders of or relating to
the fact that a Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry has been made, the
identity of the party making such Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry or any
legally required disclosure of the material terms of such Takeover Proposal or
Takeover Inquiry; _provided_ , that any such disclosure that has the effect
of withdrawing, modifying or qualifying in any manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation, shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the
Company Board Recommendation in such communication without any qualification;
_provided_ , _further_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ shall not be deemed
to permit the Company Board to make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation
except to the extent permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.6(f)(ii)_.

(c) If at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Acceptance Time, the Company or any of its Representatives receives from a
third party a bona fide written unsolicited Takeover Proposal, the Company and
its Representatives may (x) contact such third party solely to clarify the
terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal so as to determine if such
Takeover Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to constitute,
a Superior Proposal, (y) enter into and participate in discussions or
negotiations with such third party and its Representatives regarding such
Takeover Proposal and (z) furnish access and nonpublic information to such
third party in response to a request therefor, in each case, if and only if:
(i) prior to taking any action contemplated in _clauses (y)_ or _(z)_ above,
the Company shall have provided at least 24 hours prior written notice to
Parent of its intent to take any such action and the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and
the Company Financial Advisor, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to take such action

 



Page 54  contemplated in _clauses (y)_ or _(z)_ above would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law; (ii) there shall have been no breach or violation of the
terms of _Section_ __ _ 5.6(a)_ in any material respect in connection with
such third party making such Takeover Proposal; and (iii) promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) after furnishing or making available any information
to such third party, the Company furnishes or makes available such information
to Parent (to the extent such information has not been previously furnished or
made available to Parent). Any nonpublic information furnished or made
available to such third party shall be subject to an executed confidentiality
agreement in a customary form, which shall be executed prior to the time such
information is furnished or made available, that is no less restrictive in
the aggregate to the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement is on
Parent at such time (" _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ ,
that the Company shall not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any
person on or after the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
5.6_ or otherwise prohibits the Company from complying with its obligations
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not
provide information to any Person pursuant to any confidentiality agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement unless such Person agrees
prior to receipt of such information to waive any provision that would
prohibit the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ or otherwise prohibit the Company from
complying with its obligations under this Agreement.

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall (1) promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) advise Parent in writing of the receipt of any
Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry that is made or submitted by any Person
during the Pre-Closing Period, (2) provide to Parent a summary of the material
terms and conditions thereof (including the identity of the Person making such
Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry and, if applicable, complete copies of
any written request, inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer (or
written summaries thereof if the same were made in oral form), including
proposed agreements and any other written communications), (3) keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material developments, discussions or negotiations
regarding such Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry (including any
modifications to the financial or other material terms and conditions of such
Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry) on a prompt basis (and in any event
within 24 hours), and (4) upon the request of Parent, reasonably inform Parent
of the status of such Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry.

 

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives, to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Parent)
conducted on or prior to the date of this Agreement that relate to any
Takeover Proposal or Takeover Inquiry or any request for nonpublic
information relating to the Company with respect to any Takeover Proposal or
Takeover Inquiry. The Company shall also immediately terminate all physical
and electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person or any

(i) Except as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.6(f)(ii)_, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall: (A)(1) fail to make when required by
this Agreement, withhold, withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent), resolve to fail to make when required by this Agreement, withhold
or withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or publicly
propose to fail to make when required by this Agreement, withhold or withdraw
(or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the Company Board
Recommendation; (2) approve, recommend or declare advisable, resolve to
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve,
recommend or declare advisable, any Takeover Proposal; (3) fail to publicly
affirm without qualification upon Parents request as promptly as practicable
(but in any event within five Business Days after Parents request) after a
public announcement of a Takeover Proposal (or if the Outside Date is less
than five Business Days from receipt of such request from Parent as promptly
as practicable following such request) the Company Board Recommendation
(provided that the Company Board shall only be required to make such
affirmation two times for any specific Takeover Proposal (but if such Takeover
Proposal is amended, modified or supplemented, any affirmation by the Company
Board prior to such amendment, modification or supplement shall be disregarded
for purposes of this proviso)); (4) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9; (5) if any Takeover Proposal that is
structured as a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding Company Common
Stock is commenced pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act, fail to
recommend unequivocally against acceptance of such offer by the Companys
stockholders prior to the earlier of (x) the then scheduled Expiration Date,
(y) the Outside Date and (z) 11 business days (which for this purpose shall
be used as such term is used in Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange Act) after
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of
the Exchange Act; or (6) approve or recommend or publicly declare advisable
or publicly propose to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
collaboration agreement or other agreement with respect to, any Takeover
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)_) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ,"
and any action described in _clause (A)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(f)(i)_
being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Change Recommendation_ "); or (B)
cause or allow the Company to execute or enter into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.6(f)(i)_, at any time prior to, but not after, the Acceptance Time, if (I)
the Company has received an unsolicited Takeover Proposal (which Takeover
Proposal did not result from or arise out of a breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.6_ in any material respect) from any Person that has not been withdrawn
and, after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company Financial
Advisor, the Company Board has determined in good faith that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (after giving effect to all of the
revisions to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent,
including pursuant to _clause (C)_ below) or (II) after consultation with
outside legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, the Company Board
has determined there has been an Intervening Event, then (x) the Company Board
prior to the Acceptance Time may make a Company Adverse Change Recommendation
or (y) in the case of a Company Adverse Change Recommendation relating to a
Superior Proposal, and after complying with the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 5.6(f)(ii)_, the Company may terminate this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_ 

 



Page 56  in order to enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, in the case of each of _(I)_ and _(II)_ , if and only if: (A) the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and the Company Financial Advisor, that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law; (B) the Company shall have given
Parent prior written notice of its intention to make a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_
at least four Business Days prior to making any such Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or termination (a " _Determination Notice_ "), which notice
shall have included (1) with respect to an Intervening Event, a reasonably
detailed description of the Intervening Event or (2) with respect to such
Superior Proposal, a copy of the Specified Agreement, the identity of the
Person making such Superior Proposal, and a summary of the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal; (C)(1) the Company shall have given
Parent four Business Days after Parents receipt of the Determination Notice
to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make other proposals so
that either (aa) such Takeover Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior
Proposal or (bb) in the case of a Company Adverse Change Recommendation
involving an Intervening Event, such that the failure to effect a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation would not be inconsistent with the Company
Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law,
and shall have made its Representatives available to, and negotiated in good
faith with, Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or
other proposals, if any, during such period, (2) at the end of such period,
after considering in good faith the results of such negotiations and giving
effect to such proposed revisions or other proposals made by Parent, if any,
and after consultation with outside legal counsel and the Company Financial
Advisor, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith that such
Takeover Proposal is still a Superior Proposal and, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such Company Adverse Change
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law or, in the case of a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation involving an Intervening Event, that the failure
to effect a Company Adverse Change Recommendation would be inconsistent with
the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 5.6(f)(ii)_ shall also apply to every amendment to any Takeover Proposal
and shall require a new Determination Notice be delivered to Parent in
accordance with _clause (B)_ above, except that the "matching" period
described in _clauses (B)_ and _(C)_ above shall be two Business Days rather
than the initial four Business Day period.

(g) The violation of any of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ by
any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of its or such Subsidiaries
respective Representatives shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.

 

Section 5.7 _Indemnification, Advancement of Expenses and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer or
director of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
against any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and

 



Page 57  expenses of legal counsel), judgments, fines, penalties, or liabilities
(including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) imposed upon or incurred
by such Indemnified Party in connection with or arising out of any claim,
action, suit or other proceeding (whether investigative, civil or criminal,
and including any proceeding before any regulatory, administrative or
legislative body or agency) in which such Indemnified Party may be involved
(regardless of whether as a named party or as a participant other than as a
named party, including as a witness) (an " _Indemnified Party Proceeding_ ")
(A) by reason of such Indemnified Partys being or having been a director or
officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or an employee or agent of the
Company or in connection with any action taken or not taken at the request of
the Company or such Subsidiary, or (B) arising out of such
Indemnified Partys service in connection with any other corporation or
organization for which he or she serves or has served as a director, officer,
employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary at the request of the Company (including
in any capacity with respect to any employee benefit plan), in each of _(A)_
or _(B)_ , whether or not the Indemnified Party continues in such position at
the time such Indemnified Party Proceeding is asserted, claimed or threatened
(and whether asserted, claimed or threatened prior to, at or after the
Effective Time), including any matters arising in connection with the
Transactions or relating to the enforcement of this provision or any other
indemnification, exculpation or advancement right of any Indemnified Party,
to the fullest extent that the Company and its Subsidiaries would have been
permitted under applicable Law and their respective Organizational Documents
in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such individual,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, advance expenses to the Indemnified Party as incurred in defense of a
proceeding to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_
that the individual to whom expenses are advanced undertakes to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such individual is not entitled
to indemnification). The rights to advancement of expenses, indemnification
and exculpation by the Company and its Subsidiaries for acts, errors or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted,
claimed or threatened prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any
matters arising in connection with the Transactions), now existing in favor
of each Indemnified Party ( _x_ ) as provided in the Organizational Documents
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, or ( _y_ ) pursuant to any other indemnification agreements
identified on _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter in
effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, and Parent will
fulfill and honor (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and their
respective Subsidiaries to fulfill and honor) in all respects the obligations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including but not limited to any
advancement of expenses, indemnification or exculpation provision set forth in
the Organizational Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries and each
indemnification agreement identified on _Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

(b) From and after the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries shall contain provisions relating to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses to directors and officers no less
favorable to the Indemnified Parties than are set forth in the Organizational
Documents of the Company and any such Subsidiary as in effect on the date of
this Agreement.

 



Page 58 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company
is unable to, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
obtain, as of the Effective Time, in consultation with the Company, prepaid
(or "tail") insurance policies for the extension of (i) the directors
and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance policy covering acts, errors or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Companys
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_), for a claims reporting or discovery period of six years after the
Effective Time (the " _Tail Period_ "), with respect to those Persons who
are covered by the DandO Insurance as of the Effective Time, with terms and
conditions, retentions and limits of liability which are no less favorable to
the Persons currently covered by the DandO Insurance with respect to acts,
errors or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time after the
Effective Time, from one or more reputable and financially sound insurance
companies. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation fail to obtain such
"tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall continue to maintain in effect for the Tail Period the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date of this Agreement with terms and conditions, retentions
and limits of liability which are no less advantageous to the Persons
currently covered by the DandO Insurance with respect to acts, errors or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay any annual cost for the
DandO Insurance or any substitutes with respect thereto in excess of 300% of the
amount paid by the Company for coverage for the period of 12 months most
recently commenced prior to the date of this Agreement (such amount paid by
the Company, the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
cost for the DandO Insurance or any substitutes therefor exceeds 300% of the
Maximum Amount, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall purchase a substitute policy with the greatest coverage
available for 300% of the Maximum Amount. If such prepaid policies have been
obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to maintain such
policies in full force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor
the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent
shall take all necessary action to ensure that the successors and assigns of
Parent and the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section_
__ _ 5.7_.

(e) The obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries under this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall survive
the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this  _Section_
__ _ 5.7_ applies without the written consent of such affected Indemnified
Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_).

from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time. If
the Surviving Corporation is required to file any quarterly or annual report
by a filing deadline that is imposed by the Exchange Act and which falls on a

available to Parent, at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, a
substantially final draft of any such annual or quarterly report reasonably
likely to be required to be filed during such period.

with current or future directors, officers or employees of the Company and its
Affiliates pursuant to which payments are made or to be made or benefits are
granted or to be granted according to such arrangements (including any
amendment or modification thereof) to be approved as an "employment

meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)

Company shall control the defense of any Action (including any class action
or derivative litigation) against the Company or any of its or its
Subsidiaries directors or officers relating directly or indirectly to this

that the Companys entry into this Agreement or the terms and conditions of
this Agreement or any related transaction constituted a breach of the
fiduciary duties of any member of the Company Board, any member of the board
of directors (or similar body) of any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) (a " _Stockholder
Litigation_ "); _provided_ that the Company shall promptly advise Parent of

be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement (unless waived
by Parent).

(c) Parent shall keep the Company currently and reasonably informed with
respect to its efforts under this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, and shall provide
the Company and its Representatives an update with respect to its efforts
under this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ within one (1) Business Day following
Parents receipt of a request for such information from the Company.

(d) Parent shall (i) promptly upon request by the Company reimburse the
Company for all of its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and
expenses (including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees)
incurred by the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of its or
their Representatives in connection with any cooperation requested by Parent
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives
against any claim, loss, damage, injury, liability, Judgment, award, penalty,
fine, Tax, cost (including cost of investigation), expense (including
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys fees) or settlement

or goodwill of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries.

Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and do, or cause to be done, promptly, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Financing Commitment, including using reasonable best
efforts to, as promptly as possible, (i) satisfy, or cause to be satisfied, on
a timely basis all conditions to funding applicable to the Parent and/or the

to make the payments contemplated by this Agreement, Parent shall use all
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof
alternative financing, including from alternative sources, on terms and
conditions not less favorable in any material respect when taken as a whole,
to Parent and Merger Sub than the Financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitment in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing
that is available together with other cash, cash equivalents and

 



Page 64  liquidity, to satisfy Parents and Merger Subs obligations under this
Agreement (" _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event, and the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
5.15_ shall be applicable to the Alternative Financing, and, for the purposes
of this Agreement, all references to the Financing shall be deemed to include
such Alternative Financing and all references to the Financing Commitment
shall include the applicable documents for the Alternative Financing.

 

(d) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that its obligation

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

Section 7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be abandoned, by delivery of
written notice to the other parties hereto under the following circumstances:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior
to the Effective Time; or

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent as follows:

 



Page 65 (i) if the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or before June 30,
2018 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that a party shall not
be permitted to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(i)_
if the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur on or before the Outside Date
was principally caused by or resulted from the failure of such party (or in
the case of Parent, Merger Sub) to fulfill any of its obligations under this
Agreement in any material respect;

 

(ii) if any Judgment issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a
Governmental Authority, or a Law or other legal restraint or prohibition, in
each case making the consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal or
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing the consummation
thereof shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;
_provided_ that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(ii)_ if the issuance of such Judgment
was principally caused by or resulted from the failure of such party (or in
the case of Parent, Merger Sub) to fulfill any of its obligations under this
Agreement in any material respect; or

 

(c) by Parent if the Company shall have effected a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation (whether or not in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 5.6_) or
shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement;

 

(d) at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, by the Company, in order to
accept a Superior Proposal and enter into a binding written definitive
acquisition agreement providing for the consummation of a Superior Proposal (a
" _Specified Agreement_ "), in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.6_,
_provided_ that (i) the Company has complied in all material respects with
the requirements of, and is not in violation in any material respect of,
_Section_ __ _ 5.6_ and (ii) concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement, the Company pays the Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with
the applicable provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ and enters into the
Specified Agreement;

 

(e) at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, by Parent, if there has been
a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, or any
representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either
case such that (i) any of the Tender Offer Conditions set forth in
_paragraphs (3)_ or _(4)_ of _Exhibit A_ would not be satisfied; and (ii)
such breach or failure to be true and correct is incapable of being cured
prior to the Outside Date, or if curable prior to the Outside Date, has not
been cured within the earlier of (1) 30 days after giving notice thereof by
the non-breaching party to the breaching party or (2) three business days
prior to the Outside Date;  _provided_ that Parent will not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_ if Parent or
Merger Sub is then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement;

(f) at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, by the Company, if there has
been a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub, or any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub shall
have become untrue, in either case such that Parent and Merger Sub shall be
unable to consummate the Offer or the Merger and such breach or failure to be
true and correct is incapable of being cured, or if curable, has not been
cured within the earlier 

 



Page 66  of (1) 30 days after giving notice thereof by the non-breaching party to the
breaching party, (2) the Business Day prior to the Acceptance Time or (3)
three Business Days prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ that the Company
will not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 7.1(f)_ if the Company is then in material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement; or

(g) by Parent or the Company if the Offer shall have expired in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement without Merger Sub having accepted for
payment any Shares pursuant to the Offer and at the time of such expiration
any of the Tender Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall deliver written notice of
such termination to the other party, setting forth in such notice the
provision of this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ pursuant to which such party is
terminating this Agreement.

 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. Upon the termination of this
Agreement and abandonment of the Transactions pursuant to and in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of
no effect without any liability of any party to another party except for the
provisions of (a) the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)_ ( _Access to
Information; Status; Confidentiality_ ); (b) this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_; (c)
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ ( _Fees and Expenses_ ); (d)  _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ (
_Amendment_ ); (e) _Section_ __ _ 7.5_ ( _Waiver_ ); (f) _ Article_ _VIII_ (
_General Provisions_ ) and (g) the applicable definitions in _Annex A_ , 
_Exhibit A_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, which shall survive such
termination; _provided_ that no such termination shall relieve any party from
liability to the other party for any fraud or willful and material breach of
this Agreement. All other representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement shall not survive the termination of this
Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement (as amended pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 5.5(c)_) shall not be affected by the termination of this Agreement and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms, as
amended pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.5(c)_. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_willful and material breach_ " means a material breach of this Agreement
that is a consequence of an act undertaken or a failure to take an act by the
breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of such act or the failure
to take such act would cause a material breach of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parents or Merger Subs failure to cause the Offer
Acceptance Time to occur and to effect the Closing when required under this
Agreement shall be a willful and material breach of this Agreement.

Section 7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not the Offer or the
Merger is consummated. Parent shall bear and timely pay all filing fees
associated with any filings required under the HSR Act or Other Antitrust
Laws.

(b) The Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of $17,000,000 (the "
_Termination Fee_ "), in the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 



Page 67 (i) by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_ ( _Company
Recommendation Matters_ );

(ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_ ( _Superior
Proposal_ ); or

(iii) (I) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
7.1(b)(i)_ ( _Outside Date_ ), (II) by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(e)_ ( _Company Breach_ ) or (III) by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(g)_ ( _Offer not Consummated_ ) so long as, (A)
before the date of such termination, a Takeover Proposal shall have been
publicly announced, or otherwise become publicly known, or otherwise made
known to the Company, or any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover Proposal, or such
intention shall otherwise have been made known to the Company, and such
Takeover Proposal or such intention shall not have been withdrawn without
qualification prior to the time of the termination of this Agreement (and such
withdrawal must be public if (x) the Takeover Proposal shall have been
publicly announced, or otherwise become publicly known, or (y) any Person
shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to
make a Takeover Proposal), it being agreed that no such Takeover Proposal or
intention shall be deemed to have been withdrawn if the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall have entered into a definitive agreement providing for
such Takeover Proposal within 12 months after the date of such termination;
and (B) within 12 months after the date of termination, (1) the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall have entered into a definitive agreement providing
for, or shall have consummated, or (2) in the case of a Takeover Proposal that
is a tender offer or exchange offer, the Company Board or any committee
thereof shall have approved or recommended to the Companys stockholders, or
taken no position with respect to, a Takeover Proposal and such Takeover
Proposal is consummated, in each case, within 12 months after such 12-month
period; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _
7.3(b)(_ _iii)_ , all references to "15%" in the definition of
"Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%.".

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by:

(i) either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(g)_ (
_Offer not Consummated_ ) and at the time of such termination the Regulatory
Condition has been satisfied;

(ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_ ( _Company Breach_ );
or

(iii) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(g)_
( _Offer not Consummated_ ) if before the date of such termination, a Takeover
Proposal shall have been publicly announced, become publicly known, or
otherwise made known to the Company, or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Takeover
Proposal, or such intention shall otherwise have been made known to the
Company;

 

then the Company shall pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent, all of the
reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses, including those of the Paying
Agent, actually incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this
Agreement and the other Transactions (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ ") up to
a maximum amount of $7.5 million in the aggregate, within two (2) Business
Days after the

 



Page 68  date following such termination. To the extent any portion of the Expense
Reimbursement is paid by the Company to Parent, such amount paid shall be
deducted from the amount of any Termination Fee owed or payable.

(d) Any fee due under _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(i)_ shall be paid to Parent by
wire transfer of immediately available funds within two Business Days after
the date of termination of this Agreement. Any fee under _Section_ __ _
7.3(b)(ii)_ shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds prior to or concurrently with the termination. Any fee due under
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(iii)_ shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer of funds
within two Business Days after the consummation of such Takeover Proposal. Any
such wire transfer shall be made to an account designated in writing to
Parent.

(e) Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the Termination Fee
is not intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which
such Termination Fee is due and payable and which do not involve fraud or
willful and material breach, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this
Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision. Other than in the circumstances in which such
Termination Fee is due and payable and which involve fraud or willful and
material breach, in the event that Parent receives full payment pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, the receipt of the Termination Fee shall be deemed
to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any
other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or proceeding against the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the
Transactions or any matters forming the basis for such termination. The
Company shall not be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion even though the Termination Fee may be payable under one or more
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_.

(f) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that,
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences an Action which results in a judgment against the Company, the
Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received.

Section 7.4 _Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended with the
mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent at any time, provided that
none of _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, _Section_ __ _ 8.4_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.6_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.9_, _Section_ __ _ 8.12_, this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ and the
definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" (and any other provision of
this Agreement to the extent that a modification, waiver or

 



Page 69  termination of such provision would modify the substance of any of the
foregoing provisions) may be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that
is adverse to any Financing Source, without the prior written consent of such
Financing Source. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 

Section 7.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not apply to any time for
performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance
with any agreement, covenant or condition, as the case may be, other than that
which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to
this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights except as otherwise expressly
contemplated by this Agreement.

contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not
affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever

Section 8.4 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware irrespective of the choice
or conflict of laws principles of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware, as to all matters, including matters of
validity, construction, effect, enforceability, performance and remedies and
in respect of the statute of limitations or any other limitations period
applicable to any claim, controversy or dispute.

 

(b) Each party to this Agreement (i) irrevocably and unconditionally
submits to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the Chosen Courts, (ii)

by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that
any claim, actions or proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement
(including negotiation, execution or performance hereof) or the Transactions
(whether in contract, tort or otherwise) shall be brought, tried and
determined only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only
if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over
the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the
United States of America, the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware) (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), (iv) waives any claim of lack of
personal jurisdiction or improper venue and any claim that the Chosen Courts
are an inconvenient forum and (v) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in any court other than the
Chosen Courts. The parties to this Agreement agree that mailing of process or
other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner
provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ or in such other manner as may be permitted
by applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION, CLAIM OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS
OR THE FINANCING. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY: (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR

 



Page 72  OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH ACTION,
CLAIM OR PROCEEDING SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; AND (II)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.4(C)._

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each party
hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it will not bring
or support any litigation against the Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan of the City of New York, whether a state or federal court, and that
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ relating to the waiver of jury
trial shall apply to any such action, suit or proceeding.

email of .pdf attachment or other electronic transmission, each of which when

when taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Receipt of a
partys executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile, email of .pdf
attachment or other electronic transmission with permission to release such

Agreement by such party.

 

Section 8.6 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and
all of the provisions hereto shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations set forth herein shall be assigned by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any
purported assignment without such consent shall be void, except that Parent
may assign all or any of its rights and obligations hereunder to (a) any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or (b) any of the
Financing Sources without the Companys prior consent; _provided_ , _however_
