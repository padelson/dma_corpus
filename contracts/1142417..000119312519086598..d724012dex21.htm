Section 2.4. _Closing Date_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
if all of the conditions set forth in _Article_ _VII_ (other than the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(_ _c)_ ) are satisfied

 



18

    

 or, if legally permissible, waived (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied (or validly waived) at the Closing, but
subject to such satisfaction or waiver) as of the Merger Closing Date, the
purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets provided for in _Section_ __ _ 2.1_
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on the
Merger Closing Date, substantially concurrently with the consummation of the
Merger, at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York 10022; _provided_ , that if all of the conditions set forth in
_Article_ __ _ VII_ are not satisfied or, if legally permissible, waived
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied (or
validly waived) at the Closing, but subject to such satisfaction or waiver) as
of the Merger Closing Date, then the Closing shall be consummated on the date
that is two (2) Business Days following the satisfaction or, to the extent
legally permissible, waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article_ __ _
VII_, or such other time as may be determined by mutual agreement of Seller
and Buyer. The date on which the Closing occurs in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_ shall be referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ ".

 

Section 2.5. _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Purchased Assets
(the " _Purchase Price_ ") shall be equal to (i) Seven Hundred Forty Million
Dollars ($740,000,000), _plus_ (ii) the Closing Date Working Capital Amount,
or _minus_ (iii) the Closing Date Working Capital Deficit. 

Section 2.6. _Proration and Adjustments_. In determining the Closing
Date Working Capital Amount or the Closing Date Working Capital Deficit, as
the case may be, Buyer and Seller shall prorate all income earned and all
expenses incurred in connection with the Business and operation of the
Stations as of the Cutoff Time. Sales commissions earned by Employees of
Seller or any Seller Party, as applicable, prior to the Cutoff Time and
related to the sale of advertisements broadcast on any Station prior to the
Cutoff Time shall be the responsibility of Seller or the Seller Parties, and
sales commissions related to the sale of advertisements broadcast on any
Station after the Cutoff Time shall be the responsibility of Buyer. It is
agreed and understood by the parties that (i) any payables by Seller or
any Seller Party, as applicable, that are contractually due in the month in
which the Closing takes place shall be apportioned on a pro rata basis based
upon the number of days in the calendar month which includes the Cutoff Time,
(ii) accounts receivable shall be calculated net of a bad debt reserve equal
to 2% of the total gross amount of the outstanding receivables shall be
included as a Current Liability; and (iii) any amounts payable by Buyer
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(i)_ regardless of when such payments are
required to be made (including, but not limited to, the employers portion of
any withholding Taxes payable in connection with such payments) not to exceed
$1,000,000 in the aggregate (the " _Tribune Bonus Amount_ ") shall not be
included as a Current Liability. _Sections 2.6_ , _2.7_ or _2.8_ shall not be
interpreted, however, so as to provide a double payment or double credit
to Seller or Buyer for any item in the calculation of the Closing Date
Payment or the Closing Date Balance Sheet. Without limiting the foregoing,
Buyer and Seller agree that:

 

(a) " _Current Assets_ ," as used herein, shall include prepaid expenses
reflecting amounts paid by Seller or any Seller Party, as applicable, prior
to the Cutoff Time which represent benefits to be realized on or after the
Cutoff Time under Contracts included in the Purchased Assets or otherwise
relating to any Station to the extent the same do not relate to Excluded
Assets; and

(b) " _Current Liabilities_ ," as used herein, shall include
accounts payable and accrued expenses reflecting expenses and costs incurred
prior to the Cutoff Time which represent

 



19

    

 benefits realized before the Cutoff Time under Contracts included in the
Purchased Assets or otherwise relating to any Station to the extent the same
do not relate to Excluded Liabilities or have not otherwise been paid. For
the avoidance of doubt, (A) any unpaid, accrued vacation and sick leave for
any Transferred Employees will be included as a Current Liability (other than
any amounts required by applicable Law to be paid at or prior to Closing,
which amounts shall be paid by Seller) and (B) bonuses and other incentive
compensation to Transferred Employees in respect of the portion of 2019 (or,
if applicable, 2020) ending on the Closing Date shall be included as a
Current Liability other than the Tribune Bonus Amount.

Section 2.7. _Determination of Estimated Purchase Price; Payment on
Closing Date_.

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer a certificate executed on behalf of Seller by an
authorized officer thereof, dated the date of its delivery, setting forth
Sellers good faith estimate of (i) the Closing Date Working Capital Amount
or the Closing Date Working Capital Deficit, as the case may be, and (ii) the
Estimated Purchase Price. Such certificate shall be based on the then most
recently available monthly financial statements of the Seller Parties, as
they relate to the Stations, and shall reflect Sellers estimate of the
prorations contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ as of the Cutoff Time; and

 

(b) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to the
Estimated Purchase Price (the " _Closing Date Payment_ ") by bank wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account or accounts
designated by Seller for such purpose not less than two (2) Business Days
before the Closing Date.

 

Section 2.8. _Determination of Closing Date Working Capital and Purchase
Price_. 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date (but not later
than one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date), Buyer shall:

(i) prepare, in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles, a
balance sheet as of the Cutoff Time with respect to the Purchased Assets and
the Assumed Liabilities (the " _Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ");

 

(ii) determine the Purchase Price in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement (such Purchase Price as determined by Buyer being called the "
_Preliminary Purchase Price_ "); and

 

(iii) deliver to Seller a certificate executed by Buyer by an authorized
officer thereof setting forth or attaching Preliminary Closing Date Balance
Sheet and Buyers calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital Amount or
the Closing Date Working Capital Deficit, as the case may be (the "
_Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Calculation_ ") derived therefrom
and the Preliminary Purchase Price.

(b) Seller shall have thirty (30) Business Days following receipt of the
certificate referenced in _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_ (the " _Review Period_ ") in
which to review the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Preliminary
Purchase Price and the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Calculation.
In the event Seller does not object to the Preliminary closing Date Balance
Sheet of the Preliminary Purchase Price or the Preliminary Closing Date
Working Capital 

 



20

    

 Calculation prior to expiration of the Review Period, the Preliminary
Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Purchase Price and the Preliminary
Closing Date Working Capital Calculation shall become (i) the " _Closing Date
Balance Sheet_ ," (ii) the " _Purchase Price_ " and (iii) the " _Closing Date
Working Capital Amount_ " or the " _Closing Date Working Capital Deficit_
," as the case may be, respectively, for all purposes of this Agreement,
including for purposes of determining the adjustment payment (if any)
specified in _Section_ __ _ 2.9_. In the event Seller objects to the
Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Purchase Price or the
Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Calculation, Seller shall give a
written notice to Buyer specifying its objections in reasonable detail and the
basis therefor, prior to expiration of the Review Period (" _Objection
Notice_ "). During the fifteen (15) Business Day period following Buyers
receipt of the Objection Notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "), Buyer and
Seller shall attempt to resolve the differences specified in the Objection
Notice and any resolution by them (evidenced in writing) of such differences
(the " _Agreed Adjustments_ ") shall be final, binding and conclusive. In the
event Buyer and Seller resolve all disputed items set forth in the Objection
Notice by the Agreed Adjustments, the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet,
the Preliminary Purchase Price and the Preliminary Closing Date Working
Capital Calculation, in each case as adjusted by the Agreed Adjustments,
shall become (x) the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ," (y) the " _Purchase
Price_ " and (z) the " _Closing Date Working Capital Amount_ " or the "
_Closing Date Working Capital Deficit_ ," as the case may be, respectively,
for all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of determining the
adjustment payment (if any) specified in _Section_ __ _ 2.9_.

 

(c) If at the conclusion of the Resolution Period any objections raised by
Seller remain unresolved, then the amounts so in dispute (the " _Disputed
Items_ ") shall be submitted to BDO USA, LLP or another firm of independent
public accountants (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") mutually selected
by Seller and Buyer within ten (10) Business Days after the expiration of the
Resolution Period. The Independent Accounting Firm shall, acting as an expert
and not as an arbiter, determine and resolve, based solely on presentations by
Buyer and Seller, and not by independent review, the proper calculation of
the Disputed Items, consistent with the Agreed Accounting Principles. In
resolving the Disputed Items, the Independent Accounting Firms determination
shall be no higher or lower than the respective amounts proposed by Buyer and
Seller. The Independent Accounting Firms determination shall be made within
thirty (30) Business Days of its selection, shall be set forth in a written
statement delivered to Buyer and Seller and shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties hereto. The Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet,
the Preliminary Purchase Price and the Preliminary Closing Date Working
Capital Calculation shall be adjusted to reflect all Agreed Adjustments and
the resolution of all Disputed Items by the Independent Accounting Firm and,
as so adjusted, shall be (i) the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ," (ii) the "
_Purchase Price_ " and (iii) the " _Closing Date Working Capital Amount_ " or
the " _Closing Date Working Capital Deficit_ ," as the case may be,
respectively, for all purposes of this Agreement, including for purposes of
determining the adjustment payment (if any) specified in  _Section_ __ _
2.9_ (absent fraud or manifest error).

(d) The parties hereto shall make available to Buyer, Seller and, if
applicable, the Independent Accounting Firm, such books, records and other
information (including work papers) as any of the foregoing may reasonably
request to prepare or review the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, the
Preliminary Purchase Price and the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital
Calculation or any matters submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. The
fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid by Buyer
and Seller in inverse proportion as such parties may prevail based on the
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm of the unresolved objections
submitted to it pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(c)_ as such proportionate
allocation may be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm.

 



21

    

Section 2.9. _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Promptly (but not later than
five (5) Business Days) after the determination of the Purchase Price pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ that is final and binding as set forth herein:

 

(i) if the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.8_ exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such bank accounts of Seller as
Seller shall designate in writing to Buyer, the difference between the
Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase Price; or

(ii) if the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 2.8_ is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Buyer,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank accounts of Buyer
as Buyer shall designate in writing to Seller, the difference between the
Purchase Price and the Estimated Purchase Price.

Section 2.10. _Closing Date Deliveries_.

(a) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer
each of the following, in each case, to the extent applicable, duly executed

(vi) specific assignment and assumption agreements duly executed by Seller or
the appropriate Seller Party, relating to any agreements included as Purchased
Assets that Buyer or Seller have determined to be reasonably necessary to
assign such agreements to Buyer (or its permitted assignee) and for Buyer (or
its permitted assignee) to assume the Assumed Liabilities thereunder, (vii) a
duly executed certificate of non-foreign status that meets the requirements
set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2), (viii) certified

and (B) the Transition Services Agreement, (iii) all of the documents and

(iv) specific assignment and assumption agreements duly executed by Buyer
relating to any agreements included as Purchased Assets that are reasonably
necessary to assign such agreements to Buyer or for Buyer to assume the
Assumed Liabilities thereunder.

 

Section 2.11. _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) From time to time following the Closing, Seller shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to Buyer such other
instruments of conveyance and transfer as Buyer may reasonably request or as
may otherwise be necessary to effectively convey and transfer to, and vest in,
Buyer, and put Buyer in possession of, all or any portion of the
Purchased Assets.

(b) Without limiting _Section_ __ _ 5.2(g)_, to the extent that any
Station Agreement or other Contract included as a Purchased Asset cannot be
assigned without consent and such consent is not obtained prior to the
Closing, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to provide to Buyer the
benefits of any such Contract and Buyer shall perform or discharge on behalf
of Seller all obligations and liabilities under such Contract that constitute
Assumed Liabilities. In addition to Buyers obligations pursuant to the
foregoing sentence, as to any Station Agreement or other Contract included as
a Purchased Asset that is not effectively assigned to Buyer as of the Closing
Date but is thereafter effectively assigned to Buyer, Buyer shall, from and
after the effective date of such Contract, assume, and shall thereafter pay,
perform and discharge as and when due, all Assumed Liabilities of Seller,
Tribune or any of their respective Subsidiaries arising under such Contract.

 

(c) From time to time following the Closing, Buyer shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to Seller such other
undertakings and assumptions as Seller may reasonably request or as may be
otherwise necessary to effectively evidence Buyers assumption of and
obligation to pay, perform and discharge the Assumed Liabilities.

 

(d) Seller shall, and shall cause Tribune and their respective Affiliates
to, promptly pay or deliver (without right of set off) to Buyer (or its
designated Affiliates) any monies or checks in connection with, arising out
of, or relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities that have been sent to Seller or Tribune or any of
their respective Affiliates after the Closing Date by customers, suppliers or
other contracting parties of the Business or the

 



23

    

 Purchased Assets to the extent such monies or checks are not Excluded
Assets. If, following the Closing, Buyer, Seller or Tribune becomes aware that
Seller, Tribune or any of their respective Affiliates owns or holds any asset
or right that constitutes a Purchased Asset but which has not been transferred
to Buyer in connection with the consummation of the transactions hereunder,
such party shall promptly inform the other party of that fact. Thereafter, at
the request of Buyer, Seller or Tribune shall execute, or cause the relevant
Affiliate of Seller or Tribune to execute, such documents as may be reasonably
necessary to cause the transfer of any such asset or right to Buyer or any
other entities nominated by Buyer for no additional consideration, and Buyer
shall do all such things reasonably necessary to facilitate such transfer.

 

(e) Buyer shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, promptly pay
or deliver (without right of set off) to Seller or Tribune or any of their
respective Affiliates any monies or checks to the extent they are not due to
the Business or a Purchased Asset or are in respect of an Excluded Asset or
Excluded Liability hereunder. If, following the Closing, Buyer, Seller or
Tribune becomes aware that Buyer or any of its Affiliates owns or holds any
asset or right that is not a Purchased Asset and that was owned by Seller or
Tribune or any of their respective Affiliates immediately prior to the
Closing, such party shall promptly inform the other party of that fact.
Thereafter, at the request of Seller or Tribune, Buyer shall execute, or cause
the relevant Affiliate of Buyer to execute, such documents as may be
reasonably necessary to cause the transfer of any such asset or right to
Seller or Tribune or such other Person designated by Seller or Tribune for no
consideration, and Seller or Tribune shall do all such things reasonably
necessary to facilitate such transfer.

 

Section 2.12. _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall provide to Seller an allocation of the applicable portions of the
Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provisions of state,
local, or non-U.S. Law, as appropriate). Seller shall provide Buyer with any
comments to such allocation within fifteen (15) days after the date of receipt
by Seller, and Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to finalize
such allocation no later than sixty (60) days prior to the earliest due date
(taking into account, for these purposes, any applicable extension of a due
date) for the filing of a Tax Return to which such allocation is relevant
(unless Seller does not provide any comments within such fifteen-day period,
in which case Buyers allocation shall be deemed final). If the parties are
unable to mutually agree to such allocation then the parties shall have no
further obligation under this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_, and each party shall make
its own determination of such allocation for financial and tax reporting
purposes, which determination, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be
binding on the other party.

Schedule. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ of the Disclosure

Section 4.7. _Solvency_. Buyer is not entering into this Agreement with
the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of
Seller or Tribune, as applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries.
Assuming (a) that the conditions to the obligation of Buyer to consummate this

(b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Seller set forth in
_Article_ __ _ III_ and (c) the performance by Seller and the Seller Parties
of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, Buyer will be
Solvent as of immediately after the consummation of this Agreement and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ ", when used with respect to any Person,
means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the "fair
saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date,
exceed the sum of (A) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including
contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person, as of such date, on
its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date,
an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (iii)

definition, "not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged"
and "able to pay its liabilities, as of such date, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature" means that such Person will be able to
generate enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

 

Section 4.8. _Financial Capacity_. Buyer has, as of the date of this
Agreement, and will have as of the Closing Date, on hand (or access through
committed credit facilities to) adequate funds to perform all of its
obligations under this Agreement (including, but not limited to, payment of
the Purchase Price and all fees and expenses required to be paid by Buyer in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and there is
no restriction or condition on the use of such funds for such purposes or fact
or circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate with all other facts
and circumstances, could reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the
availability of such funds at the Closing.

 



38

financially and otherwise qualified to be the licensee of, and to acquire,
own, operate and control, the Stations under the Communications Act, including
the provisions relating to media ownership and attribution, foreign ownership
and control, and character qualifications. To the Knowledge of Buyer, there
are no facts or circumstances that would, under the Communications Act or any
other applicable Laws, (i) disqualify Buyer as the assignee of the Station
Licenses with respect to the Stations or as the owner and operator of the
Stations, (ii) delay the FCCs processing of the FCC Applications, or (iii)
cause the FCC to impose a material condition or conditions on its granting of
the FCC Consent. No waiver of or exemption from, whether temporary or
permanent, any provision of the Communications Act, or any divestiture or
other disposition by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of any asset or property,
is necessary for the FCC Consent to be obtained under the Communications Act.

Section 4.10. _No Finder_. There is no investment banker, broker or
finder that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of Buyer,
TEGNA or any of their respective Affiliates who is entitled to any fee or
commission from Buyer, TEGNA or any of their respective Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which
Buyer may become liable (other than J.P. Morgan, the fees for which are the
sole responsibility of Buyer).

 

Section 4.11. _Acknowledgment and Representations by Buyer_. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has conducted its own independent review
and analysis of, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment
concerning, the business, assets, condition, operations and prospects of the
Business and (b) has been furnished with or given full access to such
information about the Business and the Purchased Assets as it has requested.
In entering into this Agreement, Buyer has relied solely upon its own
investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties of Seller
set forth in this Agreement, and Buyer acknowledges that, except for Fraud or
as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its
directors, officers, employees, equityholders, agents or representatives
makes or has made any representation or warranty, either express or implied,
(i) as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information provided or
made available to Buyer or any of its agents, representatives, lenders or
Affiliates prior to the execution of this Agreement or (ii) with respect to
any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future revenues,
expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component
thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of any Station or the Business heretofore
or hereafter delivered to or made available to Buyer or any of its agents,
representatives, lenders or Affiliates. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, except for Fraud or as otherwise set forth in this Agreement,
no Seller Group Member has made and shall not be deemed to have made, any
representations or warranties in the materials relating to the Business,
the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities made available to Buyer,
including due diligence materials, memoranda or similar materials, or in any
presentation of the Business by management of Seller or others in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and no statement (contained in any
such materials or made in any such presentation) shall be deemed a
representation or warranty hereunder or otherwise or deemed to be relied upon
by Buyer in executing delivering and performing this Agreement and
transactions contemplated hereby. It is understood that any cost estimates,
projections or other predictions, including, but not limited to, any offering
memorandum or similar materials made available to Buyer and
its representatives and advisors are not and shall not be deemed to be or to
include any representations or warranties of Seller.

the FCC Consent in an expeditious manner, it is necessary for Buyer or any of
its Affiliates to enter into a customary assignment, assumption, tolling, or
other similar arrangement with the FCC to resolve any complaints with the FCC
relating to the Stations, Buyer shall enter, or cause its Affiliates, as
applicable, to enter, into such a customary assignment, assumption, tolling or

termination of the waiting period thereunder. Each of Seller and Buyer shall
file (and in the case of Seller, shall use its reasonable best efforts
(including by seeking to enforce its rights under the Merger Agreement) to
cause Tribune and its Affiliates to file), and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to file, as promptly as practicable such additional information as
may be requested to be filed by such commission or department. Buyer shall
bear 100% of the cost of any filing fees payable under the HSR Act in
connection with the notifications and information described in this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(_ _b)_.

take pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_), and shall use its reasonable best
efforts (including by seeking to enforce its rights under the Merger
Agreement) to cause Tribune to, and Buyer shall, use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied as promptly as

best efforts to (i) in the case of Buyer, obtain and maintain all necessary,
proper or advisable consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations of,

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) cooperate with each
other in (A) determining which filings are necessary, proper or advisable to
be made prior to the Closing with, and which consents, approvals, permits,
notices or authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the Closing
from, Governmental Authorities or Third Parties in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and related agreements, and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (B)
timely make all necessary filings and timely seeking all consents, approvals,
permits, notices or authorizations; _provided_ , _however_ , that the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that Seller or Tribune may take such actions as
are reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with obtaining all
necessary approvals for the Merger and to consummate the Merger, including
amending the FCC Applications (which may affect the matters referred to in
clause (ii) above), and such actions shall not be deemed a violation of this
obligation

(d) In furtherance of and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i)(x) obtain
the DOJ Consent and approval of the transactions by the DOJ or the FTC as
required under the HSR Act and the DOJ Final Judgment and (y) take promptly

Authority, in each case with competent jurisdiction or by the DOJ Final
Judgment, so as to enable the parties to close the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii) vigorously contest
(including by means of litigation) (x) any actions, arbitrations, litigations,
suits or other civil or criminal proceedings brought, or threatened to be

authorization required from such Third Party in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including agreeing to and making
divestitures, entering into hold separate arrangements, terminating, assigning
or modifying Contracts (or portions thereof) or other business relationships,
accepting restrictions on business operations and entering into commitments
and obligations). Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall, and

in order to seek to ensure that (x) no requirement for any non-action,
consent or approval of the FTC, the DOJ, any authority enforcing applicable
Competition Laws or any communications or broadcast Laws (including the
Communications Act), any state attorney general or other Governmental
Authority, (y) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or
any other order in any suit or proceeding, and (z) no other matter

preliminarily approved by the DOJ or other necessary Governmental Authority as
a purchaser of the Purchased Assets hereunder; (ii) the DOJ Staff informs
Seller or Buyer that the DOJ Staff will not recommend approval of Buyer as
purchaser of the Purchased Assets hereunder; or (iii) the DOJ Staff informs
Seller or Buyer that the DOJ Staff will require the transfer to
Buyer hereunder of any asset other than the Purchased Assets or that the DOJ
Staff will prohibit the transfer to Buyer hereunder of any such Purchased
Asset. Each of Buyer and Seller agree to consider in good faith and discuss
and reasonably cooperate with each other any changes, amendments,
modifications or waivers to this Agreement requested by DOJ.

cause Tribune and its Affiliates to) use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain all consents and amendments from the parties to the Station
Agreements which are required by the terms thereof or this Agreement for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that neither Seller, Buyer, Tribune nor any of their respective
Affiliates shall have any obligation to offer or pay any consideration in
order to obtain any such consents or amendments, including, with respect to
Seller, Tribune or any of their respective Affiliates, any obligation to
amend, modify or otherwise alter the terms of any Contract with any such
party that is not included in the Purchased Assets or, insofar as any Multi-
Station Contract relates to Other Stations, the terms thereof relating to
Other Stations; and provided, further, that the parties acknowledge and agree
that such Third Party consents are not conditions to the Closing, except for
certain third party consents applicable to the Stations set forth on _Section_

share exchange, business combination or similar transaction with another
Person, (ii) restructure, reorganize or completely or partially liquidate,

intention, enter into any agreement or otherwise make a commitment to take any
such action or (iv) take any other action that would reasonably be expected to

agreement contains provisions that expressly preclude Buyer from taking
possession of any Barred Station) any interest that would be considered
"attributable" under the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC
(including but not limited to 47 C.F.R. 73.3555) in, or otherwise acquire (x)
any television broadcast station in any Market in which Buyer owns, operates,
has entered into any agreement to acquire or has any Cooperative Agreement
with a television broadcast station, provided that, in each case, such Market
is a Market in which any Station is located or (y) any television broadcast
station where such acquisition would result in Buyer exceeding the ownership
limitations set forth in the FCCs national audience reach limitation
contained in 47 C.F.R. Section 73.3555(e); or (z) any television broadcast
station, MVPD or related asset, business or Person or division thereof that
would reasonably be expected to materially delay, or to impede or prevent, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
television broadcast stations described in clauses (x), (y) and (z) of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(h)_ shall be referred to herein as " _Barred Stations_ ".

 

Section 5.3. _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in
effect, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not and Seller shall not, and shall
use reasonable best efforts (including by seeking to enforce its rights under
the Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune not to, issue or cause the publication
of any press release or other public statement relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent
of the other party, unless such party determines, after consultation with
outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law to issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
this Agreement, in which event such party shall provide, on a basis reasonable
under the circumstances, an opportunity to the other party to review and
comment on such press release or other announcement in advance, and shall give
reasonable consideration to all reasonable comments suggested thereto.

 

Section 5.4. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of Seller and Buyer
shall promptly notify and provide copies to the other of (a) any material

Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (b) any written notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (c) any Proceeding or investigation, commenced or, to its
Knowledge, threatened against, Seller, Tribune or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Buyer, TEGNA or any of their respective

 



46

    

 Affiliates, as the case may be, that would be reasonably likely to (i)
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or (ii) result in the failure of any condition to the Closing set
forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, or (d) the occurrence of any event
which would or would be reasonably likely to (i) prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) result in
the failure of any condition to the Closing set forth in _Article VII_ to be
satisfied; _provided_ , __ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_ shall not (x) affect or be deemed to modify any
representation, warranty, covenant, right, remedy, or condition to any
obligation of any party hereunder or (y) update any section of the
Disclosure Schedule.

Section 5.5. _Access to the Business_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article_ _IX_ , upon at least two (2) Business Days prior notice and subject
to applicable Law, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall use reasonable best efforts (including by seeking to enforce its rights
under the Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune to, afford to Buyer, its
Affiliates and its officers, agents, control persons, employees, consultants,
professional advisers (including attorneys, accountants and
financial advisors) (" _Representatives_ ") reasonable access during normal
business hours, to all of the properties, books, Contracts, commitments,
records, officers and Employees concerning the Business and the Purchased
Assets and, during such period Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, and shall use reasonable best efforts (including by seeking to enforce its
rights under the Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune to, furnish to Buyer all
other information concerning the Business and the Purchased Assets as Buyer
may reasonably request; _provided_ that Seller may restrict the foregoing
access and the disclosure of information to the extent that, in its good faith
judgment, (i) any Law applicable to Seller, Tribune or any of their
respective Subsidiaries requires it to restrict or prohibit access to any such
properties or information, (ii) the information is subject to confidentiality
obligations to a Third Party, (iii) disclosure of any such information or
document could result in the loss of attorney-client privilege or (iv) such
access would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Business. Seller shall
use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the terms of
the Merger Agreement under which Seller shall reasonably request such access
(and solely to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement with respect to
Employees of the Tribune Stations), Buyer shall have the right to contact any
employee who would be a Transferred Employee to discuss compensation, employee
benefits and other terms and conditions of employment after the Closing Date,
and to make offers of employment contingent upon consummation of the
Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing to the extent they have the right
to grant such access, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and,
with respect to the Tribune Business, to the extent permitted by the Merger
Agreement, also shall use commercially reasonable efforts (including by
seeking to enforce rights under the Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune
to, permit Buyer and/or Representatives to conduct Phase I Environmental Site
Assessments and environmental compliance audits of the Owned Real Property and
properties subject to Real Property Leases, including (a) interviews of
personnel with knowledge of compliance with Environmental Laws, and (b) a
review of Environmental Permits and other records and documents relative to
compliance with Environmental Laws. Any activities, contacts, or examinations
conducted by Buyer and/or Representatives under this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_
shall be conducted at Buyers

 



47

    

 sole cost and expense and in such a manner as to (y) minimize any disruption
of the applicable locations operations and its relationships with its vendors
and customers, and (z) protect applicable proprietary information. No Phase
II Environmental Site Assessment or any other intrusive environmental sampling
or study shall be performed prior to Closing at the Owned Real Property or
properties subject to Real Property Leases by or on behalf of Buyer and
Representatives without the prior express permission of Seller or, as
applicable, Tribune. Notwithstanding the following, it is expressly understood
and agreed that Sellers obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_
are not conditions to the consummation of the Closing and any failure by
Seller to remove any such objectionable matter shall not delay the Closing.
Sellers cooperation with the activities, contacts, or examinations conducted
by Buyer and/or Representatives under this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ shall not be
deemed to satisfy or substitute for Sellers disclosures of environmental
matters in _Section_ __ _ 3.16_ of the Disclosure Schedule and Sellers
representations and warranties in _Section_ __ _ 3.16_.

 

(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.5(a)_, Buyer shall comply with, and shall cause its Representatives to
comply with, all of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
as of January 29, 2019 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), by and between
Seller, Tribune and TEGNA, which agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 5.6. _Multi-Station Contracts_. _Schedule 5.6_ contains a list as
of the date hereof of each Contract which is included in the Purchased Assets
and to which any Other Station is party, or has rights or obligations
thereunder (any such Contract, a " _Multi-Station Contract_ "). The rights and
obligations under the Multi-Station Contracts that are assigned to and
assumed by Buyer (and included in the Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities, as the case may be) shall include only those rights and
obligations under such Multi-Station Contracts that are applicable to the
Stations. The rights of each Other Station with respect to such Contract and
the obligations of each Other Station to such Contract shall not be assigned
to and assumed by Buyer (and shall be Excluded Assets and
Excluded Liabilities, as applicable,). For purposes of determining the scope
of the rights and obligations of the Multi-Station Contracts, the rights and
obligations under each Multi-Station Contract shall be equitably allocated
among (1) the Stations, on the one hand, and (2) the Other Stations, on the
other hand, in accordance with the following equitable allocation principles:

 

(a) any allocation set forth in the Multi-Station Contract shall control;

 

(b) if there is no allocation as described in clause (a) hereof, then then
reasonable accommodation (to be determined by mutual good faith agreement of
Seller and Buyer) shall control; and

(c) subject to any applicable third-party consents, such allocation and
assignment with respect to any Multi-Station Contract shall be effectuated in
accordance with the allocation principles in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, at the
election of Seller, by either (i) termination of such Multi-Station Contract
in its entirety with respect to the Stations and the execution of new
Contracts with respect to the Stations or (ii) by a partial assignment to and
assumption by Buyer of the related rights and obligations under such Multi-
Station Contract. The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain any
such new Contracts or assignments to, and assumptions by, Buyer in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_; provided, that, completion of documentation
of any such allocation under this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ is not a condition to
the Closing.

 



48

    

Section 5.7. _Station Sharing Companies_. Seller shall take all actions
necessary to cause the applicable Seller Party to (i) exercise the option to
acquire the assets of the Pennsylvania Stations (as defined in the Sharing
Agreements set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ of the Disclosure Schedule)
(the " _Sharing Agreements_ "); (ii) on the Closing Date, purchase the assets
of such Pennsylvania Stations and pay to the grantor of the option the Cash
Purchase Price (as defined in the Sharing Agreements); (iii) on the Closing
Date, transfer the assets of such Pennsylvania Stations to Buyer; and (iv) on
the Closing Date, partially assign all of the option holders right, title and
interest in and to the Sharing Agreements with respect to the Pennsylvania
Stations to Buyer or its assignee in connection with the exercise of such
option, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Sharing Agreements.

 

Section 5.8. _Transition Services Schedules_. The parties covenant
and agree to use reasonable good faith efforts to complete the Services
Schedules (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) within thirty (30)
days after the date hereof to include, for a transition period (not to exceed
12 months from the Closing Date or such longer period as reasonably agreed by
the parties): (a) the provision of such transition services as are reasonably
required to operate the Business or the Other Stations, as applicable, as
currently conducted; and (b) the license on a non-exclusive basis of (i)
Intellectual Property from Seller or the appropriate Seller Party to Buyer or
(ii) Purchased Intellectual Property from Buyer to Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries, in each case to the extent reasonably required to operate
the Business or the Other Stations, as applicable, as currently conducted (it
being understood that, if reasonably required, the parties will use reasonable
good faith efforts to complete a customary license agreement for any such
intellectual property required beyond a transition period).

(a) As of or before the Closing Date, Buyer or one or more of its
Affiliates shall offer employment to each Employee who (i) is not then on
authorized leave of absence, sick leave, short or long term disability leave,
military leave or layoff with recall rights (" _Active Employees_ ") or (ii)
is then on authorized leave of absence, sick leave, short or long term
disability leave, military leave or layoff with recall rights; provided that
such offer is contingent on such Employee returning to active employment
immediately following such absence and within six (6) months of the
Closing Date, or such later date as required under applicable Laws ("
_Inactive Employees_ "). For the purposes hereof, all Active Employees and
Inactive Employees who accept an offer of employment from Buyer and commence
employment on the applicable Employment Commencement Date are hereinafter
referred to collectively as the " _Transferred Employees_ ," and the "
_Employment Commencement Date_ " as referred to herein shall mean (x) as to
those Transferred Employees who are Active Employees, the Closing Date, and

not have Employment Agreements with Seller or Tribune, as applicable, and
shall provide each Transferred Employee initially and for at least one (1)
year after the Closing Date or, if shorter, the period of employment following
the Closing Date of the Transferred Employee, (i) the base salary or other
base cash compensation that was provided to such Transferred
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) cash incentive
compensation opportunities (including short-term annual incentive compensation
but excluding equity or equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable
in the aggregate than the aggregate total cash incentive compensation
opportunities provided to such Transferred Employee (but excluding equity or
equity-based compensation opportunities) immediately prior to the Closing,
(iii) severance and other termination pay and benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance and other termination pay and benefits that were

and (iv) other employee benefits that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer or its
Affiliates. The initial terms and conditions of employment for those
Transferred Employees who have

 



50

    

 Employment Agreements with Seller, Tribune or their Affiliates, as
applicable, shall be as set forth in such Employment Agreements, which shall,
to the extent permitted under the applicable agreements, be assigned to and
assumed by Buyer or one or more of its Affiliates, as directed by Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall cause to be maintained through
December 31 of the year in which the Closing Date occurs any Station-level
annual (or other short-term) cash incentive award programs based solely on
individual performance or performance of the applicable Station covering the
Transferred Employees substantially in the form as in effect immediately prior
to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the compensation and
benefits for Transferred Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining
agreement shall be provided in accordance with the applicable collective
bargaining agreement as amended, extended or terminated from time to time in

participate, level of benefits, vesting, and benefit accrual under a paid-
time-off, vacation or severance plan maintained by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates in which Transferred Employees are eligible to participate,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, recognize or cause to be
recognized for purposes of eligibility, level of benefits, vesting, and
benefit accruals each Transferred Employees service with Seller or Tribune,
as applicable, and with any predecessor employer, to the same extent
recognized by Seller or Tribune, as applicable, as service with Buyer or any
of its Affiliates to the same extent such service was recognized immediately
prior to the Closing, except that such service need not be recognized to the
extent such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits for the
same period of service.

 

(c) _401(k) Plan_. Buyer shall cause a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan established or designated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(" _Buyer_ __ _s 401(k) Plan_ ") to accept rollover contributions from the
Transferred Employees of any account balances distributed to them by the
existing tax-qualified defined contribution plan established or designated by
Seller or Tribune, as applicable, or any of their respective Affiliates ("
_Seller_ __ _s 401(k) Plan_ "). Buyer, Seller and Tribune shall, and shall
cause their Affiliates, as applicable, to, allow any such Transferred
Employees outstanding plan loans under Sellers 401(k) Plan to be rolled into
Buyers 401(k) Plan within 60 days of the Closing Date. The distribution and
rollover described herein shall comply with applicable Laws, and Buyer, Seller
and Tribune shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, make all
filings and take any actions required of each such Person by applicable Laws
in connection therewith.

(d) _Employee Plans_. Seller, Tribune or their Affiliates shall retain
responsibility for and continue to pay all medical, life insurance, disability
and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for each Transferred Employee

relating to the Transferred Employees employment by Seller, Tribune or their
respective Affiliates; and (ii) all liabilities, expenses and benefits
relating to the Employee Plans (except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.2)_.
With respect to any medical benefit plans maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates in which the Transferred Employees are eligible to participate on
or after the Employment Commencement Date, to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws, Buyer, or its Affiliates, shall use reasonable best efforts
to: (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations; and
(ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, amounts paid by such Transferred Employees (and their covered
dependents) during the applicable plan year including the Closing Date under
the corresponding Employee Plans.

 



51

    

(e) _Vacation_. Buyer shall assume as of the Closing all liabilities for
unpaid, accrued vacation of each Transferred Employee as of such Transferred
Employees Employment Commencement Date, giving service credit under the
vacation policy of Buyer for service with Seller or Tribune, as
applicable, and shall permit Transferred Employees to use their vacation
entitlement accrued as of Closing in accordance with the policy of Buyer as of
the Closing. Seller shall retain all liability for accrued vacation for any
Employee who does not accept an offer of employment from Buyer and for any
alleged violation of Law for Sellers or any Seller Partys failure to pay
accrued vacation of Transferred Employees upon transfer.

 

(f) _Sick Leave_. Buyer shall grant credit to Transferred Employees for
all unused sick leave accrued by Transferred Employees on the basis of their
service during the current calendar year as employees of Seller or Tribune, as
applicable. Seller shall retain all liability for accrued sick leave for any
Employee who does not accept an offer of employment from Buyer and for any
alleged violation of Law for Sellers or any Seller Partys failure to pay
accrued sick leave of Transferred Employees upon transfer.

 

(g) _Payroll Matters_.

 

(i) Seller and Buyer shall follow the "standard procedures" for preparing
and filing Internal Revenue Service Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statements), as
described in Revenue Procedure 2004-53 for Transferred Employees. Under this
procedure, (A) Seller shall provide all required Forms W-2 to (x) all
Transferred Employees reflecting wages paid and taxes withheld by Seller or
Tribune, as applicable, prior to the Employment Commencement Date, and (y)
all other employees and former employees of Seller or Tribune, as applicable,
who are not Transferred Employees reflecting all wages paid and taxes withheld
by Seller or Tribune, as applicable, and (B) Buyer (or one of its Affiliates,
as applicable,) shall provide all required Forms W-2 to all Transferred
Employees reflecting all wages paid and taxes withheld by Buyer (or one of its
Affiliates) on and after the Employment Commencement Date. 

(ii) Seller and Buyer shall adopt the "alternative procedure" of Revenue
Procedure 2004-53 for purposes of filing Internal Revenue Service Forms W-4
(Employees Withholding Allowance Certificate) and W-5 (Earned Income Credit
Advance Payment Certificate). Under this procedure, Seller shall provide to
Buyer all Internal Revenue Service Forms W-4 and W-5 on file with respect
to each Transferred Employee and any written notices received from the
Internal Revenue Service under Reg. § 31.3402(f)(2)-1(g)(5) of the Code, and
Buyer will honor these forms until such time, if any, that such Transferred
Employee submits a revised form.

(iii) With respect to garnishments, tax levies, child support orders, and
wage assignments in effect with Seller or Tribune, as applicable, on the
Employment Commencement Date for Transferred Employees and with respect to
which Seller has notified Buyer in writing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, honor such payroll

 



52

    

 deduction authorizations with respect to Transferred Employees and shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates to, continue to make payroll deductions and
payments to the authorized payee, as specified by a court or order which was
filed with Seller or Tribune, as applicable, on or before the Employment
Commencement Date, to the extent such payroll deductions and payments are in
compliance with applicable Laws, and Seller will continue to make such
payroll deductions and payments to authorized payees as required by Laws with
respect to all other employees of the Business who are not Transferred
Employees. Seller shall, as soon as practicable after the Employment
Commencement Date, provide Buyer with such information in the possession of
Seller as may be reasonably requested by Buyer and necessary for Buyer or its
Affiliates to make the payroll deductions and payments to the authorized payee
as required by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(g)_.

(h) _WARN Act_. Provided that Seller delivers accurate
information identifying terminations occurring within ninety (90) days prior
to the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
take any action within the ninety (90) day period following the Closing that
would cause any termination of employment of any employees by Seller or
Tribune, as applicable, that occurs before the Closing to constitute a "plant
closing" or "mass layoff" under the WARN Act or any similar state or local
Laws, or to create any liability to Seller or any of its Affiliates for any
employment terminations under applicable Laws. Buyer shall be responsible for
all liabilities with respect to any amounts (including any severance, fines or
penalties) payable under or pursuant to the WARN Act or any similar state or
local Laws with respect to any Employees who do not become Transferred
Employees as a result of the failure of Buyer to extend offers of employment
or continued employment as required by  _Section_ __ _ 6.2 _or with respect
to actions taken by Buyer on or after the Closing Date.

 

(i) _Payment of Bonuses_. To the extent Seller would otherwise have been
required pursuant to Section 6.4(d) of the Merger Agreement to make any bonus
payments in respect of any Transferred Employee who remained employed by
Seller or Tribune, as applicable, through the Closing Date, Buyer shall make
such payments to all such Transferred Employees as and when required to be
paid pursuant to Section 6.4(d) of the Merger Agreement and otherwise perform
all covenants of Seller thereunder in respect of such Transferred Employees,
in each case, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein.
For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that (i) each Transferred
Employee shall be treated as having been terminated without cause by Tribune
and Seller as of the Closing Date for the purposes of determining the amounts
payable under Section 6.4(d) of the Merger Agreement and (ii) there is no
obligation to pay bonuses to any Transferred Employee under _Section_ __ _
6.4(d)_ of the Merger Agreement for periods after the Closing Date.

 

(j) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 10.7_, nothing in
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, express or implied, is intended to confer on any
Person (including any Transferred Employees and any current or former
employees of Seller or Tribune, as applicable), other than the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns, any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities (including any third-party beneficiary rights)
under or by reason of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_. Accordingly, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, the parties expressly
acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is not intended to create a Contract
between Buyer, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand,
and any employee of Seller or Tribune on the other hand, and no employee of
Seller or Tribune may rely on this Agreement as the basis for any breach of
Contract claim against Buyer, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates.
Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ shall constitute an amendment to or
modification of any Employee Plan or other compensation or benefit plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement.

 



53

    

Section 6.3. _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer hereby waives compliance by
Seller with the provisions of any so-called bulk sales or bulk transfer Law of
any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to
Buyer hereunder.

Section 6.4. _Use of Names_.

 

(a) Except as expressly provided in this Section 6.4, Seller is not
conveying ownership rights or granting Buyer a license to use any of the
Retained Names and Marks and Buyer shall not and shall not permit any of its
Affiliates to use in any manner the Retained Names and Marks or any word that
is similar in sound or appearance to such names or marks. In the event Buyer
violates any of its obligations under this Section 6.4, Seller may proceed
against Buyer in law or in equity for such damages or other relief as a court
may deem appropriate. Buyer acknowledges that a violation of this Section 6.4
would cause Seller irreparable harm, which may not be adequately compensated
for by money damages. Buyer therefore agrees that in the event of any actual
or threatened violation of this Section 6.4, any of such parties shall
be entitled, in addition to other remedies that they may have, to a temporary
restraining order and to preliminary and final injunctive relief against Buyer
or any such Affiliate of Buyer to prevent any violations of this Section 6.4,
without the necessity of posting a bond.

(b) Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as necessary, to the
extent Seller has the right to grant such right and license, grants to Buyer
a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, fully-paid up,
royalty-free license to use the Retained Names and Marks for the sole purpose
of winding down the use of such Retained Names and Marks in the operation of
the Business for a period of up to ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date (the " _Transitional Period_ "). As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, but in any event by the expiration of
the Transitional Period, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i)
cease and discontinue all uses of the Retained Names and Marks and (ii)
eliminate the Retained Names and Marks from any signage or other materials
owned or controlled by Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing Date.
Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, agrees that any use of the
Retained Names and Marks within the Transitional Period shall be substantially
similar to how such Retained Names and Marks were used by Seller prior to the
Closing Date, consistent with Sellers and its Affiliates standards of
quality in effect prior to the Closing Date with respect thereto, and in
accordance with all applicable Laws. As between the parties hereto, Seller or
its Affiliates are the sole and exclusive owners of all right, title and
interest in and to the Retained Names and Marks and all rights related thereto
and goodwill associated therewith, and all uses of the Retained Names and
Marks and the goodwill arising therefrom shall inure solely to the benefit
of Seller or such Affiliates. Seller and its Affiliates shall have the right
to inspect and exercise quality control with respect to Buyers use of the
Retained Names and Marks. Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates to
not, use the Retained Names and Marks in a manner that could reasonably be
expected in any respect to reflect negatively on, or otherwise adversely
affect, any such Retained Names and Marks (including the goodwill associated
therewith) or Seller or any of its Affiliates. Without limiting any other
remedies that may be available to Seller or any of its Affiliates, Seller
shall have the right to terminate the foregoing license upon written notice to

 



54

    

 Buyer, following a fifteen (15) day notice and cure period, if Buyer or any
of its Affiliates materially breaches any of the terms or conditions set forth
in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ or otherwise fails to comply with any
reasonable direction of Seller with respect to the use of any of the Retained
Names and Marks by Buyer or its Affiliates. From and after the Closing, Buyer
shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to not, hold itself out as
having any affiliation with Seller or any of its Affiliates. From and after
the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and
against any and all Losses and Expenses imposed upon, or incurred or suffered
by, any Seller Group Member solely arising out of or relating to any use by
Buyer of the Retained Names and Marks from and after the Closing Date or any
breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4_.

Section 6.5. _Access to Records after the Closing_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Seller and its
Representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
of the Business transferred to Buyer hereunder to the extent that such access
may reasonably be required by Seller in connection with matters relating to or
affected by the operations of the Business prior to the Closing Date. Such
access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours. Seller shall be solely responsible for any
costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_.
If Buyer shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the
expiration of such six (6) year period, it shall, prior to such disposition,
give Seller a reasonable opportunity, at Sellers expense, to segregate and
remove such books and records as the other party may select.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Buyer and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
relating to the Business which Seller may retain after the Closing Date. Such
access shall be afforded by Seller upon receipt of reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any
costs and expenses incurred by it pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_. If
Seller shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the
expiration of such six (6) year period, such party shall, prior to such
disposition, give Buyer a reasonable opportunity, at Buyers expense, to
segregate and remove such books and records as the other party may select.

 

Section 6.6. _Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) As an inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement, Seller agrees
that, during the twelve (12) month period commencing on the Closing Date (the
" _Restricted Period_ "), Seller shall not, and shall cause its direct and
indirect Subsidiaries to not, whether on their own behalf or jointly with or
as an agent for any other Person, (i) solicit or induce or attempt to solicit
or induce (including by recruiting, interviewing or identifying or targeting
as a candidate for recruitment) any Transferred Employee to terminate,
restrict or hinder such persons employment or association with TEGNA or any
of its subsidiaries or interfere in any way with the relationship between such
individual and TEGNA or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) hire or offer to hire
or employ any Transferred Employee as an employee or consultant in any
capacity; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) general solicitations (of a _bona
fide_ nature) published in a journal, newspaper or other publication or posted
on an Internet job site or social media and not specifically directed towards
any such individual (and hiring or offering to hire any individual as a result
thereof) and (y) soliciting or hiring any individual whose employment with
TEGNA or any of its Subsidiaries terminated at least six (6) months prior to
the commencement of employment discussions between Seller or Tribune or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates and such individual shall not
constitute a breach of the covenant in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_.

 



55

    

(b) As an inducement to Seller to enter into this Agreement, TEGNA agrees
that during the Restricted Period, TEGNA shall not, and shall cause its direct
and indirect Subsidiaries to not, whether on their own behalf or jointly with
or as an agent for any other Person, (i) solicit or induce or attempt to
solicit or induce (including by recruiting, interviewing or identifying or
targeting as a candidate for recruitment) any corporate-level employee of
Seller or Tribune to terminate, restrict or hinder such persons employment or
association with Seller or Tribune or interfere in any way with the
relationship between such individual and Seller or Tribune or (ii) hire or
offer to hire or employ as an employee or consultant in any capacity any such
corporate-level employee of Seller or Tribune without the prior written
consent of Seller; _provided_ that (x) general solicitations (of a _bona fide_
nature) published in a journal, newspaper or other publication or posted on an
Internet job site or social media and not specifically directed towards any
such individual (and hiring or offering to hire any individual as a result
thereof) and (y) soliciting or hiring any individual whose employment with
Seller or Tribune terminated at least six (6) months prior to the
commencement of employment discussions between Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates and such individual shall not constitute a breach
of the covenant in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)_.

 

(c) Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ are reasonable in scope and duration
in light of the purpose and intent of this Agreement and the valuable
consideration being conveyed by the Parties as provided herein and are
necessary to protect Buyer and its Affiliates. If, for any reason any
Governmental Authority determines that any of those restrictions is not
reasonable or are overbroad or unenforceable or that the consideration is
inadequate in any jurisdiction or context, such restrictions shall be
interpreted, modified or rewritten to include as much of the duration and
scope as will render such restrictions valid and enforceable. The parties
agree that the covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall
be enforced independently of any other obligations between or among the
Parties, and that the existence of any other claim or defense shall not affect
the enforceability of this Agreement or the remedies hereunder.

 

Section 6.7. _Title Insurance; Survey_. Buyer may obtain, at its sole
option and expense, and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to,
and, to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts (including by seeking to enforce its rights under the
Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune to, grant Buyer access (subject to the
terms of any lease or consent of any lessor of the Leased Real Property) to
obtain (a) commitments for owners and lenders title insurance policies on
the Owned Real Property and commitments for leasehold and lenders title
insurance policies for all Leased Real Property (collectively the " _Title
Commitments_ "), (b) an ALTA survey on each parcel of Real Property (the "
_Surveys_ "), and (c) a Preliminary Zoning Report (" _PZR_ "); provided,
however, that Seller shall provide Buyer with any existing Title Commitments,
Surveys and PZRs in their possession and control. The Title Commitments will
evidence a commitment to issue an ALTA title insurance policy insuring good,
marketable and indefeasible fee simple title to each parcel of the Owned Real
Property contemplated above for such amount as Buyer directs. Seller shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in obtaining such Title Commitments and
Surveys (including by providing customary

 



56

    

 representations and affidavits to Buyers title company solely to the extent
consistent with this Agreement), provided that Seller shall not be required to
incur any cost, expense or additional liability in connection therewith. If
the Title Commitments or Surveys reveal any Lien on the title, other than
Permitted Liens, Buyer may notify Seller in writing of such objectionable
matter as soon as Buyer determines that such matter is not a Permitted Lien,
and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remove such
objectionable matter. In the event the Title Company amends or updates the
Title Commitments based on such objectionable matters, Buyer may furnish
to Seller a written statement of any objections to any matter first raised in
the updated Title Commitments, other than Permitted Liens. Notwithstanding the
following, it is expressly understood and agreed that Sellers obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.7 are not conditions to Closing and any failure by
Seller to remove any such objectionable matter shall not delay the Closing.

 

Section 6.8. _Financing_.

 

(a) Prior to the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide to Buyer, and shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Tribune, and the officers, employees and advisors
of each of the foregoing to provide to Buyer, such customary cooperation
as is reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with debt financing ("
_Financing_ ") that Buyer undertakes during such period, including using
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) participate in a reasonable number of
meetings for the purpose of financing the transactions hereunder (ii) assist
with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, private
placement memoranda, marketing materials and presentations, bank information
memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in connection with
such Financing (including public-side versions thereof; provided that Seller
shall not be obligated to ascertain whether any information constitutes
material non-public information with respect to Buyer) and (ii) furnish
Buyer, its representatives and financing sources with such pertinent and
customary information regarding the Business sufficient to create a customary
confidential information memorandum, including financial statements, pro forma
financial information, financial data, audit reports, auditors consents, and
other information of such type as may be reasonably by Buyer; _provided_
 that such information shall be readily available to Seller, Tribune or their
respective Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (1) no such cooperation shall be required to the extent that it
would require Seller, Tribune or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take
any action that in the good faith judgment of Seller unreasonably interferes
with the ongoing business operation of Seller, Tribune and/or their respective
Subsidiaries or would require any directors, officers or employees to attend
any bank meeting, rating agency presentation, roadshows or other marketing
activities (other than, by any station managers who will continue to be
employed by Buyer after the Closing), (2) none of Seller, Tribune or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other
fee or incur any other liability or obligation in connection with the
Financing, (3) none of Seller, Tribune or any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to do anything that would cause the
representation or warranty of Seller in this Agreement to be breached or any
condition to Closing to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of
this Agreement by Seller and (4) none of Seller, Tribune or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or their respective director, officer or employee
shall be required to execute or deliver or have any liability or obligation
under any loan agreement or any related document or any other agreement or
document (including any certificates or legal opinions) related to the
Financing. Buyer shall promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for
all reasonable and invoiced out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys fees) incurred by Seller, Tribune or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of Seller and its Affiliates
contemplated by this Section 6.8.

 



57

    

Section 6.9. _Business Financial Statements_. Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its officers, employees and outside
auditor (at Buyers expense) to provide such reasonable assistance as may be
requested by Buyer in connection with Buyers preparation and filing within
74 calendar days following the Closing Date of such annual audited and interim
unaudited financial statements of the Stations on a combined basis as may be
required pursuant to Rule 3.05 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

INDEMNIFICATION

twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date. Any covenant or
agreement contained herein to be complied with at or prior to the Closing
(the " _Pre-Closing Covenants_"), including those covenants of Buyer and
Seller in _Sections 2.10_, _5.1_ through _5.4_ , _5.5(a),_ _5.6_ , _6.7_ ,
and _6.8_ , shall terminate on the Closing Date and shall thereafter

 



59

    

 be of no further force or effect. The covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement (including this _Article_ __ _ VIII_) other than the Pre-
Closing Covenants (the " _Post-Closing Covenants_ "), shall survive the
Closing until fully performed. All Seller representations and warranties
herein will not survive the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the time
periods set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ may be extended solely for the
purpose of claims that may be made under the RandW Insurance Policy with respect
to a representation and warranty of the Seller in accordance with the terms
of the RandW Insurance Policy. In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, if,
at any time prior to the expiration of the respective survival period set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.1 _with respect to any particular indemnity
obligation, any Indemnified Party delivers to the Indemnitor a written notice
alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or breach of such representation,
warranty or covenant and asserting a claim for Loss or Expense pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.2_, then the representation, warranty or covenant underlying
the claim asserted in such notice and the indemnity obligations under this
_Article VIII_ shall survive solely for the purpose of the indemnification
obligations of the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim, until such
claim is finally and fully resolved in accordance with this Agreement.

 

Section 8.2. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to the other provisions and limitations of this _Article_ __ _
VIII_, from and after the Closing, Seller agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer from and against any and all Losses and Expenses imposed upon,
or incurred or suffered by, any Buyer Group Member arising out of or relating
to: (i) a breach by Seller of any Post-Closing Covenant made by Seller in
this Agreement; and (ii) any Excluded Liabilities.

(b) Subject to the other provisions and limitations of this _Article_ __ _
VIII_, from and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
Seller from and against any and all Losses and Expenses imposed upon, or
incurred or suffered by, any Seller Group Member arising out of or relating
to: (i) a breach of or inaccuracy in, or any misrepresentation with respect
to, any of the representations and warranties made by Buyer contained in
_Article_ __ _ IV_ of this Agreement; (ii) a breach by Buyer of any Post-
Closing Covenant made by Buyer in this Agreement; and (iii) any Assumed
Liabilities.

 

(c) Absent Fraud, the sole and exclusive recourse of Buyer in respect of
any Seller representation or warranty is filing claims under the RandW
Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and each Buyer
Group Member, that, absent Fraud, Seller shall not have any direct
or indirect liability with respect to any breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement.

 

(d) For the purposes of determining the amount of any Losses and Expenses
suffered by any Buyer Group Member, the covenants of Seller set forth in this
Agreement shall be considered without regard to any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualification therein.

 

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that the RandW Insurance Policy is
intended to be a Contract between Buyer and the RandW Insurer, separate and
apart from this Agreement. As such, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Article_ __ _ VIII_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, nothing in this
_Article_ __ _ VIII_ (including the limitations or exceptions set forth in

 



60

    

 this _Article_ __ _ VIII_) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed
to limit the rights of Buyer and any other Buyer Group Member provided under
the RandW Insurance Policy, subject to the terms and conditions thereof. Buyer
shall ensure that such RandW Insurance Policy contains a waiver by the insurer
of any and all rights or obligations against Seller and its Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors and representatives (other than with
respect to Fraud) and shall cause each insured party under the RandW Insurance
Policy not to waive, amend, modify or otherwise revise such subrogation
provision or allow such provision to be amended, modified or waived without
prior written consent of Seller.

(f) If any amount is determined to be due from Buyer or Seller under this
_Article_ __ _ VIII_, such indemnification shall be paid by such party to the
Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five
(5) Business Days after it is determined that such amount is due pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b),_ as applicable.

 

(g) Neither a Buyer Group Member nor a Seller Group Member shall be
entitled to be compensated more than once for the same Loss or Expense.

(h) The Buyer Group Members right to indemnification pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ on account of any Losses and Expenses will be reduced
by all insurance or other third party indemnification or contribution proceeds
actually received by the Buyer Group Members, net of all costs of
recovery incurred by or on behalf of the Buyer Group Members (including
amounts paid to the RandW Insurer under the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy)
and the net present value of any increase in premiums of the applicable
insurance policies of the claims so made. Buyer shall use reasonable efforts
to claim and recover any Losses and Expenses suffered by the Buyer Group
Members under all such insurance policies and other third party indemnities.
The Buyer Group Members shall remit to Seller any such insurance or other
third party proceeds that are paid to the Buyer with respect to Losses and
Expenses for which the Buyer Group Members have been previously compensated
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ net of all costs of recovery incurred by
or on behalf of the Buyer Group Members and the net present value of any
increase in premiums of the applicable insurance policies of the claims so
made.

 

(i) The Buyer Group Members will not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ for Losses and Expenses to the extent
that such Losses or Expenses were included in the calculation of the Purchase
Price.

 

Section 8.3. _Notice of Claims; Determination of Amount_.

 

(a) Any party seeking indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_
") shall give promptly to the party or parties, as applicable, obligated to
provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") a
written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification hereunder and shall
include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of
computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of
this Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder upon which such claim
is based. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, the failure of any Indemnified
Party to give the Claim Notice promptly as required by this _Section_ __ _
8.1_ shall not affect such Indemnified Partys rights under this _Article
VIII_ except to the extent such failure is actually and materially prejudicial
to the rights and obligations of the Indemnitor.

 



61

    

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
_Article VIII_ shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final Order of any court
of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a
court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have
expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall
have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of
proof in establishing the amount of Losses and Expenses suffered by it.

 

Section 8.4. _Third Person Claims_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
8.1_, in order for a party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or
demand made by any third Person against the Indemnified Party, such
Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable
detail, of the third Person claim promptly, but in any event within ten (10)
Business Days, after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of
the third Person claim, which such notification must include a copy of the
written notice of the third Person claim that was received by the Indemnified
Party (the " _Third Person Claim Notice_ "). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnitor, promptly, but in any event within five (5)
Business Days, after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the third Person claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
should a party be physically served with a complaint with regard to a third
Person claim, the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnitor with a copy of
the complaint promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business Days, after
receipt thereof and shall deliver to the Indemnitor promptly, but in any
event within seven (7) Business Days, after the receipt of such complaint
copies of notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the third Person claim. Subject to _Section_ __
_ 8.1_, the failure of any Indemnified Party to promptly provide a Third
Person Claim Notice as required by this _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ shall not affect
such Indemnified Partys rights under this _Article VIII_ except to the
extent such failure is actually and materially prejudicial to the rights and
obligations of the Indemnitor.

 

(b) In the event of the initiation of any legal proceeding against the
Indemnified Party by a third Person, the Indemnitor shall have the right
after the receipt of a Third Person Claim Notice, at its option and at its own
expense, to be represented by counsel selected by the Indemnitor, and
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and to control, defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any proceeding, claim, or
demand which relates to any loss, liability or damage indemnified against
hereunder; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate in
any such proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its expense; _provided,
further_ , that the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume the defense of
such third Person proceeding, claim or demand if (x) counsel to the
Indemnified Party shall have in good faith concluded that there is or is
reasonably likely to be an actual conflict of interest between the Indemnitor
and any Indemnified Party in such proceeding, claim or demand that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Indemnitors ability to defend
the interests of the such Indemnified Party in such third Person proceeding,
claim or demand or (y) the Third Party Claim Notice seeks an injunction or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or relates to or arises
in connection with any criminal or quasi-criminal action against the
Indemnified Party. The

 



62

    

 parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in connection with
the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such proceeding, claim or
demand. Prior to the time the Indemnified Party is notified by the Indemnitor
as to whether the Indemnitor will assume the defense of such proceeding, claim
or demand, the Indemnified Party shall take all actions reasonably necessary
to timely preserve the collective rights of the parties with respect to such
proceeding, claim or demand, including responding timely to legal process. To
the extent the Indemnitor elects not to defend such proceeding, claim or
demand (or fails to confirm its election) within thirty (30) days after
the giving by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnitor of a Third Person Claim
Notice, or is not permitted to assume the defense of such third Person claim
under the circumstances provided above, the Indemnified Party may retain
counsel, reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitor, at the expense of the
Indemnitor, and control the defense of, or otherwise deal with, such
proceeding, claim or demand. Regardless of which party assumes the defense of
such proceeding, claim or demand, the parties agree to cooperate with one
another in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include providing
records and information that are relevant to such proceeding, claim or demand,
and making each parties employees and officers available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder and to act as a witness or respond to legal
process. Whether or not the Indemnitor assumes the defense of such proceeding,
claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such proceeding, claim or
demand without the Indemnitors prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnitor shall not
consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
such proceeding, claim or demand without the Indemnified Partys prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) unless such settlement or judgment (a) relates solely to monetary
damages for which the Indemnitor shall be responsible and (b) includes as an
unconditional term thereof the release of the Indemnified Party from all
liability with respect to such proceeding, claim or demand, in which event no
such consent shall be required. After any final judgment or award shall have
been rendered by a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of
competent jurisdiction and the time in which to appeal therefrom has expired,
or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnitor shall arrive at a mutually binding agreement with respect to
each separate matter alleged to be indemnified by the Indemnitor hereunder,
the Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnitor notice of any sums due
and owing by it with respect to such matter and the Indemnitor shall pay all
of the sums so owing to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer, certified or
bank cashiers check within thirty (30) days after the date of such notice.

Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter.

 

(b) In the case where the Indemnitor makes any payment to the Indemnified

damages, including loss of future profits, revenue or income, damages based on

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION 

Section 9.1. _Termination_.

 

(a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date
(except as otherwise stated below):

 

(i) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

 

(ii) by Seller, if a breach or failure to perform any of the covenants or
agreements of Buyer contained in this Agreement shall have occurred, or there
shall be any inaccuracy of any of the representations or warranties of Buyer
contained in this Agreement, and such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy
either individually or in the 

 



64

    

 aggregate would, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, give rise
to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ to be
satisfied, and such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy if curable, is
not cured by, on or before the earlier of (i) the Termination Date or (ii)
thirty (30) days following Buyers receipt of written notice from Seller of
such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy, or which by its nature or
timing cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)(ii)_ if Seller is then in breach of any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or any of the
representations or warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement shall be
inaccurate, and, in any such case would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ to be satisfied;

 

(iii) by Buyer, if a breach or failure to perform any of the covenants or
agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement shall have occurred, or
there shall be any inaccuracy of any of the representations or warranties of
Seller contained in this Agreement, and such breach, failure to perform or
inaccuracy either individually or in the aggregate would, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ to be satisfied, and such breach, failure to
perform or inaccuracy if curable, is not cured by, on or before the earlier
of (i) the Termination Date or (ii) thirty (30) days following Sellers
receipt of written notice from Buyer of such breach, failure to perform or
inaccuracy, or which by its nature or timing cannot be cured prior to the
Termination Date; provided, however, that Buyer shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)(_ _iii)_ if
Buyer is then in breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement or any of the representations or warranties of Buyer contained
in this Agreement shall be inaccurate, and, in any such case would give rise
to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3 _to be
satisfied;

(iv) by Seller or Buyer, if any U.S. federal or state court of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable Order
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the sale of
the Purchased Assets contemplated hereby;

 

(v) by Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or
before March 30, 2020 (the " _Termination Date_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _
9.1(a)(_ _v)_ shall not be available to any party if the failure of the
Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of such party to
perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in
this Agreement; or

 

(vi) by Seller if the DOJ indicates at any time that it will not, or is
unlikely to, provide DOJ Consent or approval pursuant to the DOJ Final
Judgment; or

(vii) by Seller, upon the valid termination of the Merger Agreement for
any reason.

 



65

    

(b) The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 9.1(_ _a)_ (other than pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)(_ _i)_ ) shall
give written notice of such termination to the other party or parties, as
applicable,.

 

(c) Subject to clause (d) below, in the event that this Agreement shall be
terminated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(_ _a)_ , all further obligations
of the parties under this Agreement (other than _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, this
_Article_ _IX_ and _Article_ _X_ , and, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Confidentiality Agreement, which, in each case, shall remain in full force and
effect notwithstanding such termination) shall be terminated without further
liability of any party; provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party
from liability for any breach of this Agreement.

Section 9.2. _Withdrawal of Certain Filings_. In the event of termination
under the provisions of this Article IX, all filings, applications and other
submissions relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as to
which termination has occurred shall, to the extent practicable, be withdrawn
from the Governmental Authority or other Person to which made.

ARTICLE X

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 10.1. _Amendment and Modification_. Subject to applicable Law,
this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in any and all
respects by written agreement of Seller and Buyer at any time whether prior to
or after the Closing with respect to any of the terms contained herein.

 

Section 10.2. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing,
subject to applicable Law, Buyer on the one hand, or Seller on the other
hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement of the other party or (c) waive
compliance by the other party with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party
of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further
exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement.

 

Section 10.3. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the
party incurring such cost or expense.

 

Section 10.4. _Disclosure Schedule References_. All capitalized terms not
defined in the Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement (the " _Disclosure
Schedule_ ") shall have the meanings assigned to them in this Agreement. The
Disclosure Schedule shall, for all purposes in this Agreement, be arranged in
numbered and lettered parts and subparts corresponding to the numbered and
lettered sections and subsections contained in this Agreement. Each item
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule shall constitute an exception to or, as
applicable, disclosure for the purposes of, the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable,) to which it makes

 



66

    

 express reference and shall also be deemed to be disclosed or set forth for
the purposes of every other part in the Disclosure Schedule relating to the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable,) set forth in
this Agreement to the extent a cross-reference within the Disclosure Schedule
is expressly made to such other part in the Disclosure Schedule, as well as to
the extent that the relevance of such item as an exception to or, as
applicable, disclosure for purposes of, such other section of this Agreement
is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure. The listing of any
matter on the Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute
an admission by Seller or Buyer, as applicable, or to otherwise imply, that
any such matter is material, is required to be disclosed by Seller or Buyer
under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or
materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in the
Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible breach or violation by Seller or
Buyer of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication
that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. In no
event shall the listing of any matter in the Disclosure Schedule be deemed or
interpreted to expand the scope of the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 10.5. _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, by
facsimile (with confirmation of transmission), by email (with confirmation of
receipt) or sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service, such as

Section 10.6. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement, it being understood that each party hereto need not sign the same
counterpart. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Signatures delivered electronically or by facsimile shall be deemed to
be original signatures.

 

Section 10.7. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including the Exhibits hereto and the documents and the
instruments referred to herein), the Disclosure Schedule, the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Seller Ancillary Agreements and
the Buyer Ancillary Agreements (a) constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between Seller and Buyer with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof
and (b) are not intended to and do not confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities upon any Person other than the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 10.8. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the
remainder of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so
long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby, taken as a whole, is not affected in a manner materially adverse to
any party hereto. Upon such a determination, the parties to this Agreement
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 10.9. _Assignment_. Except provided in this  _Section_ __ _
10.9_, this Agreement shall not be assigned by any party hereto. Any party
(including, for this purpose, Seller and Buyer) may assign or transfer any of
its rights under this Agreement to any of their Affiliates (in the case of
Buyer which is a Subsidiary of TEGNA), provided that no such assignment or
transfer materially delays the grant of the FCC Consent, clearance under the
HSR Act, if necessary, or approval by 

 



68

    

 the DOJ pursuant to the DOJ Final Judgment, and provided further that no
such assignment or transfer shall operate to relieve a party of any of its
liabilities or obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 10.10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the
application of the Law of any other state.

 

Section 10.11. _Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement shall be
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby. The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, including the obligations to consummate the
Seller Ancillary Agreements and the Buyer Ancillary Agreements, in the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware without proof of actual damages or
otherwise (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The
parties rights in this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby waives any objections
to any remedy referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 10.11._

(b) In addition, each of the parties (i) consents to submit itself, and
hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of
Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any
state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in
the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying
of venue in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) agrees that it will not bring
any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if
neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of the
State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, and (iv) consents to
service of process being made through the notice procedures set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 10.5_.

 

Section 10.12. _Waiver of Jury Trail_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 



69

     

Section 10.13. _Guarant_ _or_. Subject to the provisions of this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.13_, as consideration for the benefits that Buyer and TEGNA
will receive as a result of Buyer entering into this Agreement, TEGNA hereby
fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Seller the
prompt payment and performance of all of Buyers obligations under this
Agreement in full in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. TEGNA hereby
acknowledges that, with respect to all of Buyers obligations under this
Agreement, this guaranty shall be a guaranty of payment and performance and
not of collection and shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit
of any remedies against any Buyer Group Member. TEGNA hereby waives diligence,
demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of a merger or
bankruptcy of Buyer, any right to require a proceeding first against Buyer,
the benefit of discussion, protest or notice and all demands whatsoever, and
covenants that this guaranty will not be discharged as to any obligation
except by satisfaction of such obligation in full. TEGNA hereby irrevocably
waives any claim or other rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against
Buyer that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of
its obligations under the guarantee set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 10.13_,
including any right of reimbursement, exoneration, contribution,
indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or remedy or
any collateral which Buyer hereafter acquires, whether or not such claim,
remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law,
including the right to take or receive from Buyer, directly or indirectly, in
cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or
security on account of such claim or other rights. To the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the obligations of TEGNA hereunder shall not be affected by
(a) the failure of a party to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any
right or remedy against Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or
otherwise, (b) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any
release from any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement or the
invalidity or unenforceability (in whole or in part) of this Agreement, unless
consented to in writing by Seller and (c) any change in the existence
(corporate or otherwise) of Buyer or TEGNA or any insolvency, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding affecting any of them or their assets.
TEGNA acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the
consummation of the Transactions and that the waivers set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 10.13_ are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

 

Section 10.14. _Confidential Nature of Information_. Each party agrees
that it will treat in confidence all documents, materials and other
information which it shall have obtained regarding the other party or parties
during the course of the negotiations leading to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether obtained before or after the date
of this Agreement), the investigation provided for herein and the preparation
of this Agreement and other related documents, and, in the event the
transactions contemplated hereby shall not be consummated, each party will
return to the other party or parties all copies of nonpublic documents and
materials which have been furnished in connection therewith. Without limiting
the right of either party to pursue all other legal and equitable
rights available to it for violation of this _Section_ __ _ 10.14_ by the
other party, it is agreed that other remedies cannot fully compensate the
aggrieved party for such a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 10.14_ and that
the aggrieved party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent a
violation or continuing violation hereof.

 

Section 10.15. _Disclaimer of Warranties_. Neither Seller nor Tribune
makes any representations or warranties with respect to any projections,
forecasts or forward-looking information provided to Buyer. There is no
assurance that any projected or forecasted results will be achieved. EXCEPT AS
TO THOSE MATTERS EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE

 



70

    

 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE CERTIFICATES
DELIVERED BY THE SELLER PURSUANT TO _SECTION_ __ _ 7.2_, SELLER IS SELLING
THE BUSINESS AND THE PURCHASED ASSETS ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND
SELLER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTIES WHETHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO
MERCHANTABILITY, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO
IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. Buyer acknowledges that neither Seller nor any
of its representatives nor any other Person has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
memoranda, charts, summaries or schedules heretofore made available by Buyer
or its representatives or Affiliates or any other information which is not
included in this Agreement or the Schedules hereto, and neither Seller nor any
of its representatives nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability to Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any other Person resulting from
the distribution of any such information to, or use of any such information
by, Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any of their agents, consultants,
accountants, counsel or other representatives. Buyer, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that neither it nor any of its
Representatives has relied, and none of such Persons is relying, upon any
statement, warranty or representation (whether written or oral) not made in
this Agreement; provided that nothing in this Agreement shall limit or
restrict the ability of Buyer to bring an action based on Fraud.
