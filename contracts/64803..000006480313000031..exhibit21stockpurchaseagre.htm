by Seller to the Escrow Agent at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing (the "Seller Payment Amount"). The Escrow Amount shall be retained in
the Escrow Account until released pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement.

SECTION 2.3. The Closing.(a) The closing of the transactions contemplated
hereby (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and

or the Closing, as the case may be), or such other later date as Buyer and
Seller may mutually agree in writing, and (y) after, but on the same day as,
the Funding Time. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter
referred to as the "Closing Date".

(b) At the Closing, and subject to Buyer's and Seller's receipt of the

SECTION 2.5. Purchase Price Adjustments.

(a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Buyer a certificate signed by an officer of the Company,
accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation, setting forth in
reasonable detail the Company's good faith estimate of: (i) the Working
Capital as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding on the
Closing Date (the "Working Capital Estimate"), as well as the calculation of
any resulting estimated Working Capital Overage or estimated Working Capital
Underage, and (ii) (x) the Cash, (y) the Indebtedness of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, the amount of such Indebtedness that is to be paid
and discharged on the Closing Date, and the Bridge Loan Payoff Amount, and (z)
the Transaction Expenses and the Transaction Expenses Payoff Amount, as well
as the calculation of the estimated Initial Equity Purchase Price.

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare
in good faith and deliver to Seller a combined balance sheet which shall set
forth its calculation of the assets and liabilities of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet") and a statement
(the "Statement") of (i) the Working Capital derived from the Closing Date
Balance Sheet (the "Closing Working Capital") and (ii) (x) the Cash, (y) the
Indebtedness of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the close of
business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the amount of such
Indebtedness that was paid and discharged on the Closing Date and the Bridge
Loan Payoff Amount, and (z) the Transaction Expenses and the Transaction
Expenses Payoff Amount, as well as its calculation of the Initial Equity
Purchase Price derived therefrom and from the Closing Date Balance Sheet (the
"Equity Purchase Price"), together with reasonable supporting calculations and
documentation. Seller's independent accountants may participate in the
preparation of the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Statement; provided,
however, that Seller acknowledges that the Company shall have the primary
responsibility and authority for preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet and
the Statement.

 (c) During the forty-five (45) day period following Seller's receipt of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Statement, Seller and its independent
accountants shall be given access at all reasonable times to the personnel,
properties, books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
shall be permitted to review the working papers relating to the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and the Statement. The Closing Date Balance Sheet and the
Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the 45th day
following delivery thereof, unless Seller gives written notice of its
disagreement with the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Statement (a "Notice
of Disagreement") to Buyer prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement
shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted.
If a Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer in a timely manner, then the
Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Statement (as revised in accordance with
this sentence) shall become final and binding upon Seller and Buyer on the
earlier of (A) the date Seller and Buyer resolve in writing any differences
they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement
and (B) the date any disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the
Accounting Firm. During the forty-five (45) day period following the delivery
of a Notice of Disagreement (the "Resolution Period"), Seller and Buyer shall
seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If at the end of the
Resolution Period any matters properly included in the Notice of Disagreement
remain in dispute, Seller and Buyer shall each submit to
PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such
other nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be
agreed upon by the parties hereto in writing (in any such case, the
"Accounting Firm") for resolution, in accordance with the standards set forth
in this Section 2.5, any and all such matters, in the form of a written brief
delivered to the Accounting Firm within thirty (30) days after the end of the
Resolution Period. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to, and Seller and
Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to, render a
written decision resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within
thirty (30) days of the receipt of such submission. The scope of the disputes
to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to whether the Closing
Working Capital and the Equity Purchase Price were calculated in accordance
with the standards set forth in this Section 2.5 (including the Balance Sheet
Principles) and the definitions set forth in this Agreement and whether there
were errors in the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Statement and the
Accounting Firm is not to make any determination as to whether the Balance
Sheet Principles are appropriate or as to whether the WC Target is correct.
The Accounting Firm's decision shall be conclusive and binding upon the
parties and shall be based solely on the written submissions by Seller and
Buyer and their respective representatives and not by independent review. The
Accounting Firm shall address only those items in dispute and may not assign a
value greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or
smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Accounting Firm is not
authorized or permitted to make any determination as to the accuracy of
Section 4.6 or any other representation or warranty in this Agreement or as to
compliance by the Company with any of its covenants or agreements in this
Agreement (other than in this Section 2.5). Judgment may be entered upon the
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the
party against which such determination is to be enforced. The cost of any
arbitration (including the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and
reasonable attorney fees and expenses of the parties) pursuant to this Section
2.5 shall be borne by Buyer and Seller in inverse proportion as they may
prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting Firm

 at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits
of the matters submitted. For the avoidance of doubt and solely as an
illustration of the methodology set forth in the preceding sentence, if (i)
the Notice of Disagreement delivered by Seller assigns values to the disputed
matters such that the Closing Working Capital set forth in the Statement would
be increased by $1,000,000, (ii) Buyer maintains that the Closing Working
Capital set forth in the Statement is correct and (iii) the Accounting Firm's
final resolution of the disputed items in accordance with this Section 2.5(c)
is that the Closing Working Capital is increased from the amount set forth in
the Statement by $600,000 (i.e., sixty percent (60%) of the amount in dispute
is resolved in favor of Seller), then Seller shall be responsible for 40% of
such cost of arbitration and Buyer shall be responsible for 60% of such cost
of arbitration. Except as provided in the two preceding sentences, the fees
and disbursements of Buyer's independent auditors incurred in connection with
their review of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Statement and any Notice
of Disagreement shall be borne by Buyer, and the fees and disbursements of
Seller's independent accountants incurred in connection with their review of
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Statement and any Notice of Disagreement
shall be borne by Seller.

(d) Within ten (10) Business Days after the determination of the final Closing
Date Balance Sheet and the Statement: (i) if the Equity Purchase Price, as
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.5(c), is greater than the Initial Equity
Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay, or cause the Company to pay to Seller, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, cash in an amount equal to such
excess, and (ii) if the Equity Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to Section
2.5(c), is less than the Initial Equity Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to
Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, cash in an amount
equal to such deficit. If the Equity Purchase Price is equal to the Initial
Equity Purchase Price, neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required to make any
payment. Any amounts due under this Section 2.5(d) which are not paid when due
shall bear interest from such due date until paid at the prime rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition on such due date.

(e) The term "Working Capital" means Current Assets minus Current Liabilities
as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date.
The terms "Current Assets" and "Current Liabilities" mean, respectively, the
total combined current assets and total combined current liabilities of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries covered by the line items set forth in
the Form of Working Capital Statement attached as Exhibit G (the "Form of
Working Capital Statement"), calculated in accordance with the Balance Sheet
Principles; provided that: (i) "Current Assets" shall not include: (x) any
Cash, (y) any Tax assets or Tax receivables or (z) any intercompany assets or
receivables as between Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries) on the one hand, and the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, and (ii) "Current Liabilities" shall not
include: (u) any Bridge Loan Costs; (v) any Tax liabilities or Taxes payable
(other than the employer's portion of applicable payroll taxes described in
the definition of Employee Payment); (w) any Transaction Expenses; (x) any
Indebtedness; (y) any amounts payable (whether or not accrued) in respect of
any Employee Payment or 2014 annual incentive compensation; provided, however,
that (1) Employee Payments shall be included in "Current Liabilities" to the
extent they exceed $22,000,000 in the aggregate and (2) if any Employee
Payment is made by the Company or its Affiliates prior to the Closing, then
the amount so paid shall be treated as a "Current Asset" (less the value of
any available U.S.

 federal Tax deduction associated with such payment, assuming a tax rate of
35%), or (z) any intercompany liabilities or payables as between Seller and
its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) on the
one hand, and the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand.
Except as set forth in this Section 2.5, the Closing Working Capital and its
components, Current Assets and Current Liabilities, shall be calculated and
the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, without change in or introduction of new or different
reserves, accruals, accounting methods, policies, practices, principles,
procedures, classifications, judgments, estimation methodologies or line items
from those reflected in the audited combined balance sheet of the Company
Business as of December 31, 2012 included in the Company Financial Statements
(the "Balance Sheet Principles"); provided, however, that, in the event that
the Balance Sheet Principles conflict with GAAP, GAAP shall prevail. All
intercompany payables and intercompany receivables that are payable or
receivable, as the case may be, between the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall be cancelled
as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date,
other than the Transaction and Management Fee Agreement.

(f) During the period of time from and after the Closing Date through the
final determination of Closing Working Capital and the Equity Purchase Price
in accordance with this Section 2.5, Buyer shall afford, and shall cause the
Company to afford, to Seller and the accountants, counsel and/or financial
advisers retained by Seller in connection with the determination of Closing
Working Capital and the Equity Purchase Price in accordance with this Section
2.5 reasonable access during normal business hours to all the properties,
books, contracts, personnel and records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries relevant to the determination of Closing Working Capital and the
Equity Purchase Price in accordance with this Section 2.5. In furtherance of
the foregoing, Buyer shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to
deliver promptly to Sellers copies of any bills or invoices received by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary subsequent to the Closing and prior to the
final determination of Closing Working Capital and the Equity Purchase Price
and which purport to relate to Transaction Expenses.

audited combined statements of operations, net parent investment and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012,
together with the notes thereto (collectively, the "Company Audited Financial
Statements"), and (ii) the unaudited combined balance sheets of the Company
Business of Apria Healthcare Group Inc. as of June 30, 2012, June 30, 2013 and
September 30, 2013 and the related unaudited combined statements of
operations, net parent investment and cash flows for the six-month periods
ended

 June 30, 2012 and 2013 and the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013
(collectively, the "Company Unaudited Financial Statements", and, together
with the Company Audited Financial Statements, the "Company Financial
Statements"). The Company Financial Statements have been prepared from the
books of account and other financial records of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP, as at the dates and for the periods
presented (except as may be stated therein or in the notes thereto and, with
respect to the Company Unaudited Financial Statements, subject to normal year-
end adjustments), consistently applied by the Company, and fairly present, in
all material respects, the combined financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods presented therein,
subject to the notes therein and, in the case of the Company Unaudited
Financial Statements, normal year-end adjustments.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedules,
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has any Liability of a
type that would be required to be reported on a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except Liabilities (i) disclosed in the Company
Financial Statements, (ii) incurred since December 31, 2012 in the ordinary
course of the Business consistent with past practice, (iii) expressly
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The Company and the respective Company Subsidiaries maintain systems of
internal controls and procedures concerning financial reporting sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, including
but not limited to internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance that: (A) transactions are executed only in accordance
with management's and directors' general or specific authorization; (B)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in conformity with GAAP
and maintain accountability for assets and such records are maintained in
reasonable detail and accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; and
(C) the recorded accountability for assets (which, for the avoidance of doubt,
includes the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that
could have a material effect on the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries'
respective financial statements) is maintained at reasonable intervals and
appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. There are no
significant deficiencies (as such term is defined in Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act) in the Company and the Company Subsidiaries' internal controls
likely to adversely affect the Company and the Company Subsidiaries' ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there has not been any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries who have a significant role in its internal controls over
financial reporting. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party
to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance
sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between the Company
and any Company Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
person, on the other

 hand, or any "off balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
in the Company's or such Company Subsidiary's financial statements.

(d) Since December 31, 2012, (i) the Company and each Company Subsidiary have
conducted the Company Business only in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, (ii) there has not been any event, occurrence,
circumstance, development or condition that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, and (iii) except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement
(including Exhibit A) or as set forth in Section 4.6(d) of the Company
Disclosure Schedules, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has taken
any of the actions described in clauses (a) through (g) or (i) through (s) or
(u) of Section 6.1.

SECTION 4.7. Litigation. Except as set forth in the Company Financial
Statements or in Section 4.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedules, there are no
Actions or Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or otherwise related to
Seller's and its Affiliates' conduct of the Company Business, by or before any
Governmental Authority, other than any such Actions or Proceedings for amounts
which do not exceed $100,000 on an individual basis. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is subject to any outstanding Order which would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially affect
the Company Business or have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. To the
Knowledge of the Company, no Action or Proceeding has been instituted against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary before any Governmental Authority by any
Person (including any public authority) seeking to restrain or prohibit the
execution and delivery by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries of this

thereby.

SECTION 4.11. Employees; Employee Benefits.

(a) Section 4.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth as of the
date hereof a complete and correct list of (i) all material "employee benefit
plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and (ii) all material bonus,
stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, benefit, incentive
compensation, profit sharing, savings, retirement, disability, insurance,
vacation, incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental retirement,
severance, termination pay, salary continuation, employment, consulting,
indemnification, layoff, unemployment, change in control, medical, dental,
health, welfare and other similar fringe or employee benefit plans, programs,
agreements or arrangements written or otherwise (including any employee
communication evidencing any express or implied commitment with respect to any
of the foregoing) maintained or contributed to, or under which any of the
Company, Seller or their Affiliates could have any direct or indirect
Liability, in each case, for the benefit of or relating to any Company
Employee, director or consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(whether or not material, the "Employee Plans"), excluding expired or fully
performed agreements under which neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary could have any Liability whatsoever. Section 4.11(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule separately designates each Employee Plan that is sponsored
or maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiary (whether or not
material, the "Company Employee Plans"). Each Employee Plan that is not a
Company Employee Plan is hereinafter referred to as a "Seller Employee Plan."
No Employee Plan is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the United States
or covers any Company Employees or other service providers of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary who reside or work outside of the United States.

 (b) In respect of each Company Employee Plan set forth on Section 4.11(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has made available to Buyer (i)
the most recent annual report on Form 5500 filed with the Internal Revenue
Service for any Company Employee Plan where such report is required and (ii) a
true and complete copy of the plan documents (including all amendments) and
trust agreements or other funding arrangements, if any, governing such
Employee Plan (other than those referred to in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) (or,
if the Employee Plan is not written, a written description thereof). Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any express or implied commitment
to modify, change or terminate any Employee Plan, other than with respect to a
modification, change or termination required by Law.

(c) All Company Employee Plans have been established, operated and
administered in all material respects in compliance with their terms and
applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code. There are no Actions or
Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing
against any Employee Plan which would reasonably be expected to result, in the
aggregate, in any material Liability to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists that would give
rise to any such Action or Proceeding.

(d) None of the Employee Plans is (i) subject to Title IV of ERISA, (ii) a
multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA
(a "Multiemployer Plan") or (iii) a single employer pension plan within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA for which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary could incur Liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a
"Multiple Employer Plan"). None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, nor
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has ever during the six-year period
ending on the Closing Date maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or incurred
any Liability or obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan subject
to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. None of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary, nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred
any Liability under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA,
other than Liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
arising in the ordinary course of business, including any Liability in
connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any employee benefit
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or (ii) the withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists that
would give rise to any such Liability.

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, with respect to any Employee Plan, there
has not occurred any non-exempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is
defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA which could result
in a material Liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Each
Employee Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has timely
received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue
Service to such effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, no fact or event has
occurred since the date of such determination or opinion letter or letters
from the IRS that could adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Employee Plan.

(f) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any Company Employee Plan have been made on or before their due dates. No
insurance policy or any other Contract affecting any Company Employee Plan
requires or permits a retroactive

 increase in premiums or payments due thereunder. In accordance with applicable
law, each Company Employee Plan (other than any Company Employee Plan that is
an employment, severance, or similar agreement with a specified individual)
can be amended or terminated by the Company at any time, without consent from
any other person and without material liability other than for benefits
accrued as of the date of such amendment or termination (other than
administrative expenses incurred as a result of such termination) or
liabilities that arise under applicable Law.

(g) No Company Employee Plan provides for post-retirement medical or other
post-retirement welfare benefits (excluding severance pay and benefits), other
than the medical benefits required to be provided under Part 6 of Subtitle B
of Title I of ERISA or any similar law ("COBRA"), and none of the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has any obligation or Liability to provide any such
benefits except to the extent expressly required by COBRA or any similar local
law.

(h) Except as set forth in Section 4.11(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in
combination with any other event) will (i) entitle any Company Employee or
current or former director or consultant of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to severance pay or any material increase in severance pay, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or materially increase the amount
of compensation due to any such Company Employee or director or consultant,
(iii) directly or indirectly cause the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
transfer or set aside any assets to fund any material benefits under any
Employee Plan, (iv) increase any benefits otherwise payable by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary under any Employee Plan or otherwise give rise to any
material Liability pursuant to any Employee Plan, (v) limit or restrict the
right to merge, materially amend, terminate or transfer the assets of any
Employee Plan on or following the Closing or (vi) result in any forgiveness of
indebtedness to any Company Employee or current or former director or
consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(i) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any obligation to
provide (whether pursuant to an Employee Plan or otherwise) a "gross-up",
indemnity payment or otherwise to compensate any individual with respect to
the additional taxes or interest pursuant to Section 280G of the Code or
Section 4999 of the Code.

(j) Each Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been administered
in compliance with its terms and the operational and documentary requirements
of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any obligation to gross up, indemnify
or otherwise reimburse any individual for any excise taxes, interest or
penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

bargaining agreement with respect to Company Employees with any labor

represented for purposes of collective bargaining by any labor union or works
council, (ii) to

practice or labor charge or complaint is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company threatened with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
before the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or any other Governmental Authority.

Company Subsidiary is in compliance with all applicable Laws respecting labor,
employment, fair employment practices (including equal employment opportunity
laws), terms and conditions of employment, workers' compensation, occupational
safety and health, affirmative action, employee privacy, plant closings,
proper classification of "employees" and "independent contractors",
withholdings, and wages and hours. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or
citation by, any Governmental Authority relating to employees or employment
practices.

respective Company Employees or adequately accrued in accordance with GAAP for
all wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, benefits and other compensation due
to or on behalf of such employees.

the effect that it has (a) improperly classified as an independent contractor
any of its officers or employees or (b) improperly classified an employee as
"exempt" or "nonexempt" under the United States Fair Labor Standards Act or
any state, local or foreign counterpart.

(e) Section 4.12(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, with

(g) To the Knowledge of the Company and except as set forth on Section 4.7 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, no Company Employee who is (1) at or above
the level of vice president or (2) directly responsible for revenue generation

SECTION 6.2. Efforts.

(a) Subject to Section 6.3, each party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts, and shall cause its Affiliates to use their commercially reasonable
efforts, to cause the Closing

 to occur as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement
and, in any event, on or prior to the Termination Date, including taking all
actions reasonably necessary to comply as promptly as reasonably practicable
with all legal requirements that may be imposed on it or any of its Affiliates
with respect to the Closing. Each party shall not, and shall not permit any of
their respective Affiliates to, take any actions that would, or that could
reasonably be expected to, result in any of the conditions set forth in
Article VII not being satisfied.

(b) Prior to the Closing, subject to Section 6.3, each party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause its Affiliates to use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain, and to cooperate in
obtaining, all Consents from third parties, including any landlords and any
Governmental Authorities, necessary or appropriate to permit the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to make or give, and to
cooperate in making or giving, all filings and notices necessary or
appropriate in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that neither the Company
nor Buyer shall be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur
any obligation in favor of) any Person from whom any such Consent may be
required (other than any reasonable filing or application fees). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, prepare and file, in consultation with the other party and
as promptly as practicable and advisable after the date hereof, all
documentation to effect all necessary or appropriate applications, notices,
petitions and filings, including with respect to any change of control Consent
or notification requirements of applicable Governmental Authorities with
jurisdiction over any Health Care Law, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to obtain as promptly as reasonably
practicable and maintain all Consents necessary to be obtained from any third
party, including any Governmental Authority. Each of the parties will consult
and cooperate reasonably with the other in connection with any filings,
analyses, presentations and memoranda made or submitted by or on behalf of
itself or any of its Affiliates to any third party in accordance with this
Section 6.2(b) (including, with respect to making a particular filing, by
providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its
advisors prior to filing and, if requested, giving due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith).
Following the Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts,
and shall cause its Affiliates to use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts, to cooperate with Buyer's and the Company's and the Company
Subsidiaries' efforts to effect all necessary or appropriate applications,
notices, petitions and filings with, and to obtain any and all Consents from,
any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over any Health Care Law, in each
case, as promptly as practicable, to the extent such applications, notices,
petitions and filings cannot be made and such Consents cannot be obtained, by
their terms, until following the Closing.

(c) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller and the
Company shall give prompt notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt notice
to Seller and the Company, (a) of any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or from any Person alleging that
the Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) of any Actions or Proceedings
commenced relating to or otherwise affecting such party or any of its
Affiliates which relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (c) if such party becomes aware of any fact, circumstance or event that

 would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in
Article VII not to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
understood and agreed that neither the delivery or non-delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 6.2(c) nor any disclosures provided thereby shall
affect any of the rights, remedies or obligations of the parties hereunder.

SECTION 6.3. Regulatory Filings.

(a) Each of the Company and Buyer shall as promptly as reasonably practicable,
but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, (i) file or cause to be filed with the FTC and the
DOJ the notification and report form, if any, required for the transactions
contemplated hereby and any supplemental information requested in connection
therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) make such other filings as are
necessary in other jurisdictions in order to comply with all applicable Laws
relating to competition and shall promptly provide any supplemental
information requested by applicable Governmental Authorities relating thereto.
Any such notification and report form and supplemental information shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act and such other
applicable Law relating to competition. Each of the Company and Buyer shall,
and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under the HSR Act and such other applicable Law relating to competition and in
connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry by the FTC, the
DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or any
other Law relating to competition with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of the Company and Buyer shall, and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to, keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other applicable Governmental Authority and
shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, comply as promptly as
reasonably practicable with any such inquiry or request and shall, and shall
cause its respective Affiliates to, provide as promptly as reasonably
practicable any supplemental information requested in connection with the
filings made hereunder pursuant to the HSR Act and such other applicable Law
relating to competition. Any such supplemental information shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act and such other
applicable Law relating to competition. Neither the Company nor Buyer (nor any
of their respective Affiliates) shall participate in any meeting with the FTC,
the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigations or other inquiries without giving the other party
reasonable notice prior to the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, giving the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate at such meeting. Each of the Company and Buyer will consult and
cooperate with the other in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of itself or any of its Affiliates in connection
with all meetings, actions and proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or
other applicable Laws relating to competition (including, with respect to
making a particular filing, by providing copies of all such documents to the
non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, giving
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
in connection therewith).

(b) Buyer shall be solely responsible for any filing fees under the HSR Act.

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of Buyer,
Seller, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to
agree to sell, divest, dispose of or hold separate any assets or businesses,
or otherwise take or commit to take any action that could limit its freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more businesses,
product lines or assets; provided, however, that Buyer shall agree, consistent
with the terms hereof, conditioned on the Closing, to the extent necessary to
ensure satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.1(a) on or prior
to the Termination Date, and if the parties are informed by the management of
the Bureau of Competition of the FTC that such actions are necessary and
required, to the divestiture, disposition, assignment, novation or transfer of
such tangible or intangible assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as did not collectively generate, during the 12-month period ended June 30,
2013, gross profits in excess of $16,000,000 in the aggregate.

SECTION 6.4. Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall provide
Buyer and its Representatives with reasonable access during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice to the offices, properties, books and records
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and of Seller and its Subsidiaries
(to the extent relating to the Company Business or the Restructuring),
including continued access to a "frozen" version of the electronic data room
maintained by Seller and its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided that such access does not unreasonably interfere
with the normal operations of the Company; provided further that all requests
for such access shall be directed to Seller or such other Person as the
Company may designate in writing from time to time. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to
disclose any information to Buyer if such disclosure would be reasonably
likely to (a) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege, so long
as the Company shall have made all reasonable efforts to take any action (such
as entering into a joint defense agreement or other arrangement to avoid loss
of the attorney-client privilege) with respect to such information as is
necessary to permit disclosure to Buyer and its Representatives, or (b)
contravene any applicable Laws (including the Antitrust Laws) or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date hereof, so long as, with respect to
any binding agreements, the Company shall have made all reasonable efforts to
obtain a waiver regarding the disclosure to Buyer and its Representatives from
the third party to whom the confidentiality obligation is owed. Neither the
Company nor Seller make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of
any information (if any) provided pursuant to this Section 6.4, and Buyer may
not rely on the accuracy of any such information, in each case other than as
expressly set forth in the representations and warranties contained in Article
III and Article IV. The information provided pursuant to this Section 6.4 will
be used solely for the purpose of effecting the transactions contemplated
hereby, and will be governed by all the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) Following the Closing, upon the written request of Buyer, Seller shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, to the extent permitted by Law and
confidentiality obligations existing as of the Closing Date and consistent
with the protection of attorney-client privilege (so long as Seller shall have
made all reasonable efforts to take any action with respect to the relevant
information as is necessary to permit disclosure to Buyer and its
Representatives, including entering into a joint defense agreement or
requesting a waiver from any third party to whom any

 confidentiality obligation is owed), grant to Buyer and its Representatives
during regular business hours the right, at the expense of Buyer, to inspect
and copy the books, records and other documents (if any) in the possession of
Seller or any of its Affiliates which relate to the operation of the Company
Business prior to the Closing (including any books of account, records, files,
invoices, correspondence and memoranda, customer and supplier lists, data,
specifications, insurance policies, operating history information and
inventory records) (the "Seller Retained Records"). Seller agrees to retain,
and cause its Affiliates to retain, the Seller Retained Records for a period
of the greater of (i) seven (7) years after the Closing Date and (ii) any
applicable statutory or regulatory retention period, as the same may be
extended.

(c) Following the Closing, upon the written request of Seller, Buyer shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, to the extent permitted by Law and
confidentiality obligations existing as of the Closing Date and consistent
with the protection of attorney-client privilege (so long as Buyer shall have
made all reasonable efforts to take any action with respect to the relevant
information as is necessary to permit disclosure to Seller and its
Representatives, including entering into a joint defense agreement or
requesting a waiver from any third party to whom any confidentiality
obligation is owed), grant to Seller and its Representatives during regular
business hours the right, at the expense of Seller, to inspect and copy the
books, records and other documents (if any) in the possession of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates which relate to the operation of the Apria Business prior to
the Closing (including any books of account, records, files, invoices,
correspondence and memoranda, customer and supplier lists, data,
specifications, insurance policies, operating history information and
inventory records) (the "Buyer Retained Records"). Buyer agrees to retain, and
cause its Affiliates to retain, the Buyer Retained Records for a period of the
greater of (i) seven (7) years after the Closing Date and (ii) any applicable
statutory or regulatory retention period, as the same may be extended.

SECTION 6.5. Employee Matters.

(a) During the 12-month period commencing on the Closing Date, Buyer shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries), to provide to the Company Employees who continue
with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (the
"Continuing Employees"), base salary, base wage rate or base commissions, and
target annual cash bonus opportunities (for Continuing Employees eligible
immediately prior to the Closing for bonuses under the Employee Plans set
forth on Section 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules), that are in the
aggregate no less than (subject to adjustment for voluntary changes in
position) the base salary, base wage rate or base commissions, and target
annual cash bonus opportunities (for Continuing Employees eligible immediately
prior to the Closing for bonuses under the Employee Plans set forth on Section
6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules), being provided to Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date (for the avoidance of doubt
excluding, for purposes of calculating a Company Employee's level of base
salary, base wage rate or base commissions, and target annual cash bonus
opportunities immediately prior to the Closing Date, the value of equity-based
compensation and any special retention or other change in control related
compensation); provided, that (1) performance metrics and goals for annual
cash bonus opportunities described in the preceding portion of this sentence
shall be established and determined by Buyer and (2) Buyer's obligation with
respect to continuation

 of target annual cash bonus opportunities shall apply only to the annual bonus
year ending December 31, 2014. Continuing Employees will be provided with
"employee welfare benefits" (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA) that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than (1) through May 31, 2014, the
employee welfare benefits provided to the Continuing Employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date and (2) after May 31, 2014, the employee welfare
benefits provided to the similarly-situated employees of Buyer. During the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary
thereof, Continuing Employees will be provided with severance benefits that
are substantially comparable to the severance benefits available to the
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall (i) prevent the amendment or
termination of any Employee Plan in accordance with the terms of any such
Employee Plan or interfere with Buyer's right or obligation to make such
changes as are necessary to conform to or comply with applicable Law or (ii)
limit the right of Buyer or its Affiliates to terminate any Continuing
Employee after the Closing Date.

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to comply in full with, and honor, the terms of the Company's
2013 annual bonus plans; provided that (x) the Company may not amend such
bonus plans following the Closing in any way that adversely impacts any
Continuing Employee with respect to the 2013 calendar year; (y) in no event
may the Company exercise any discretion to reduce the amounts otherwise
payable to Continuing Employees under such bonus plans, except for
discretionary reductions due to individual performance to the extent permitted
by the terms of the applicable bonus plans; and (z) if the employment of any
Continuing Employee is terminated by the Company without "cause" (within the
meaning of the severance plan generally applicable to such Continuing
Employee) following the Closing but prior to the applicable payment date under
such bonus plan, then such Continuing Employee shall be entitled to receive a
bonus under such bonus plan, payable when bonuses under such plan are
generally paid (but no later than March 15, 2014) with no pro ration. Buyer
shall cause the Company or a Company Subsidiary to make the Employee Payments
in accordance with their terms and applicable law.

(c) As of and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries), to recognize service with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (and their predecessor entities) prior to the Closing Date
("Prior Service") for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for
purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit plans), under any
employee compensation, incentive, and benefit (including vacation) plans,
programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Continuing
Employees as of and after the Closing Date by Buyer and its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to the
extent that Prior Service was recognized under a similar Employee Plan and to
the extent that it would not result in duplication of benefits. With respect
to each Buyer plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA), Buyer and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or
eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible
and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by,
and amounts reimbursed to, Continuing Employees under similar plans maintained
by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing
Date.

 (d) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (i) the Company
shall submit for approval by its stockholders, in accordance with Section 280G
of the Code and the regulations thereunder (the "Section 280G Stockholder
Vote"), any payments that could reasonably be expected to constitute a
"parachute payment" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code (each, a "Parachute
Payment") (if the right to any Parachute Payment shall have been irrevocably
waived by each of the applicable individuals who may receive a Parachute
Payment (the "Disqualified Individuals")), and (ii) the Company shall have
delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of all disclosures and documents
that comprise the stockholder approval of each Parachute Payment as set forth
in this Section 6.5(d) in sufficient time to allow Buyer to comment thereon
(but no less than seven (7) Business Days prior to the Section 280G
Stockholder Vote) and shall reasonably consider in good faith Buyer's comments
thereon. To the extent any Disqualified Individual fails to waive any
Parachute Payments or the Company fails to perform a proper Section 280G
Stockholder Vote with respect to any Disqualified Individual, then the value
of any otherwise available U.S. federal Tax deduction associated with
Parachute Payments made by the Company and its Affiliates following the
Closing and lost pursuant to Section 280G of the Code shall be treated as
"Transaction Expenses".

(e) Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall take such actions as are
necessary to fully vest Continuing Employees in any unvested account balances
held by such Continuing Employees under any Seller Employee Plan that is a
401(k) retirement plan.

(f) Seller shall be responsible for providing any notices required to be given
and otherwise complying with WARN relating to any employment losses as defined
in WARN caused by the Seller or its Affiliates (including the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries) prior to the Closing. Buyer shall be responsible for
providing any notices required to be given and otherwise complying with WARN
relating to any employment losses caused by Buyer or its Affiliates on or
after the Closing. Through the time at which the Closing occurs, Seller shall
provide Buyer with information regarding terminations of employment sufficient
to assess whether obligations under WARN will arise as a result of any
subsequent terminations of employment in the ninety (90) days following the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, provided that Seller provides such
information about employment losses that occur in the 90 day period preceding
the Closing and which do not otherwise trigger WARN notice requirements, Buyer
shall be responsible for providing any and all notices required by WARN
arising out of employment losses that occur ninety (90) days following the
Closing. The Company and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in the provision of
any such notices prior to the Closing in a form that is compliant with WARN.

(g) This Agreement shall inure exclusively to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns, executors
and legal representatives. Nothing in this Agreement shall (i) confer any
rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any Continuing Employee, or
their respective successors and assigns, beneficiaries or dependents or (ii)
be treated as an amendment to any particular Employee Plan.

SECTION 6.6. Repayment of Debt; Financing.

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Buyer drafts of the payoff
letters with respect to the Senior

 Secured Term Loan and the Amended and Restated ABL Facility and draft
documents relating to the redemption of the bonds and satisfaction and
discharge of the related indenture with respect to the Series A-2 Notes (the
"Specified Indebtedness Payoff Letters"), in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Seller and Buyer, providing that, upon and subject to the
financing of the Bridge Loan and use of the proceeds thereof as contemplated
by Step 3 of the Restructuring, all obligations to pay principal, premium and
interest payments to, and all Liens in favor of, the holders of Indebtedness
under the Specified Indebtedness will be automatically terminated and
released, any future obligations with respect to any Contracts relating
thereto will be terminated (in each case, except such obligations that by
their terms survive the Specified Indebtedness Repayment), all guarantees by
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in respect thereof shall be cancelled
and extinguished, and that the Company will be authorized to file and record
all Lien release documentation necessary to document the release of such Liens
(the "Specified Indebtedness Repayment").

(b) Seller shall use its, and cause its Subsidiaries to use, their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
financing contemplated by the Bridge Loan Commitment, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to
funding in the Bridge Loan Commitment and the definitive agreements entered
into pursuant thereto, (ii) enforce its rights under the Bridge Loan
Commitment, and (iii) subject to the terms and upon satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in the Bridge Loan Commitment, cause the Financing
Sources providing such Bridge Loan to provide the Bridge Loan at, or as soon
as practicable after, 9 a.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date (the
"Funding Time") (but not later than the Closing Date). Seller will exercise
its rights to extend the Bridge Loan Commitment in the event that the
Termination Date is extended pursuant to Section 9.1(b) hereof. Seller shall
keep Buyer informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to consummate the Bridge Loan or any other Alternative
Financing. In the event any portion of the Bridge Loan becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Bridge Loan Commitment, (A)
Seller shall immediately notify Buyer and (B) Seller shall use, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain alternative financing from alternative sources (the "Alternative
Financing") on terms no less favorable in any respect to Seller than those in
the Bridge Commitment and in an amount sufficient to repay and discharge all
obligations in respect of the Specified Indebtedness as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event; provided that Buyer and
its Affiliates (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries following
the Closing) shall not have any liability thereunder to pay or be responsible
for, directly or indirectly fees and expenses in an aggregate amount greater
than those contemplated by the Bridge Loan Commitment on the date hereof. For
the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Bridge Loan Commitment" shall be
deemed to include any Bridge Loan Commitment (or similar agreement) or
commitment with respect to any Alternative Financing. Seller shall promptly
notify the Buyer in writing (A) if Seller has actual knowledge of any breach
or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or
default) by any party to the Bridge Loan Commitment, (B) of the receipt by
Seller of any written notice or other written communication from any financing
source with respect to any actual breach, default, termination or repudiation
by any party to any Bridge Loan Commitment or (C) if, for any reason, Seller
no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to

 obtain all or any portion of the Bridge Loan contemplated by the Bridge Loan
Commitment on the terms described therein. Seller shall not agree to (i) an
early termination of the Bridge Loan Commitment or (ii) any amendment,
modification, waiver of any provision under the Bridge Loan Commitment, in
each case, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which in the case
of subclause (ii) shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided that it shall
not be unreasonable for the Buyer to withhold consent to any amendment,
modification or waiver if such amendment, modification or waiver (A) reduces
the aggregate amount of the Bridge Loan Commitments, (B) imposes new or
additional conditions or otherwise amends, modifies, waives or expands any of
the conditions to the receipt of the Bridge Facility, (C) could reasonably be
expected to delay the Closing or (D) adversely impacts in any respect the
ability of the Seller to enforce its rights against the parties to the Bridge
Commitments or any agreement related thereto. Seller shall use, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of the Bridge Loan Commitment until the Bridge Loan
(or Alternative Financing, as applicable) is consummated. Buyer agrees to pay
at the Funding Time (and subject to the occurrence of the Closing) (i) all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Seller which
are due and payable to administrative agent under the Bridge Loan Commitment,
the collateral agent under the Bridge Loan Commitment and lenders providing
the Bridge Loan Commitment, in each case, to the extent required under Section
10.04 of the Bridge Loan Facility (as in effect on the date hereof and
excluding any agency fees) or any comparable provision in any Alternative
Financing that would result in no additional fees and expenses being payable,
directly or indirectly, by the Buyer than those contemplated by Section 10.04
of the Bridge Loan Facility (as in effect on the date hereof) and (ii) the
commitment fee incurred by the Seller to Goldman Sachs pursuant to the first
paragraph of the fee letter (as in effect on the date hereof) or pursuant to
any other Alternative Financing provided that the aggregate fees payable in
such Alternative Financing are equal to or less than the fees that would have
been payable pursuant to the first paragraph of the fee letter as in effect on
the date hereof (the "Bridge Loan Commitment Fee", and collectively "Bridge
Loan Costs"). Buyer shall have no responsibility to pay or reimburse any fees,
expenses or other amounts in respect of the Bridge Loan Commitment in the
event the Closing does not occur (without limiting any of Seller's rights
under Section 9.3(a)). In the event that the Closing occurs but any fees
(including any fees payable under the fee letter), expenses or, other amounts
other than the Bridge Loan Costs specified above, are payable or paid, or any
interest has been paid or is payable in respect of the Bridge Loans (such
other fees, expenses, other amounts or interest, "Additional Financing
Costs"), such Additional Financing Costs shall be treated as "Transaction
Expenses" and deducted from the purchase price. In no event shall Buyer be
responsible for the fees and expenses of any legal, financial or other advisor
to the Seller, or any accounting costs incurred by the Seller in connection
with the Bridge Loan Commitment.

(c) At the Funding Time and subject to the receipt of the proceeds of the
Bridge Loan, Seller shall use such proceeds to repay and discharge all
obligations in respect of the Specified Indebtedness.

(d) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a draft of a payoff letter (the "Bridge Loan Payoff Letter"),
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Buyer, providing
that, upon the full payment of the amounts required by Section 2.4(a), all
obligations to pay principal, premium and interest payments to, and all Liens
in

 favor of, the holders of Indebtedness under the Bridge Loan will be
automatically terminated and released, any future obligations with respect to
any Contracts relating thereto will be terminated (in each case, except such
obligations that by their terms survive the Repayment), all guarantees by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries in respect thereof shall be cancelled and
extinguished, and that the Company and/or Buyer will be authorized to file and
record all Lien release documentation necessary to document the release of
such Liens (the "Repayment").

(e) Seller shall not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates (including
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to, amend, modify or terminate any
Contracts relating to the Specified Indebtedness if such amendment,
modification or termination would reasonably be likely to have a Seller
Material Adverse Effect. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to take all such actions
as may be reasonably required under the Specified Indebtedness and each
Contract related thereto to facilitate the repayment and discharge thereof at
the Funding Time upon and subject to the receipt of the proceeds of the Bridge
Loan, including the giving of any notices that may be required as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and delivery of any legal
opinions, officers' certificates or other documents or instruments required in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) If and only if (i) the conditions set forth in Section 7.1, 7.2(A) and
7.3(A) have been satisfied (in each case assuming that the Bridge Loan
Commitment has been funded) and (ii) the Financing Sources (or the agent on
behalf of the Financing Sources) confirm that all of the documentary
conditions precedent to closing (other than the delivery of the Financing
Certificate) to the obligations of the Lenders to make Bridge Loans under
Section 4.01 of the Bridge Loan Commitment (or any comparable provision of any
Alternative Financing) have been satisfied and that subject to receipt of the
Financing Certificate the Lenders are prepared to fund, then Buyer and Seller
agree to deliver, immediately prior to the Funding Time on the Closing Date, a
certificate to that effect and confirming the willingness of Buyer and Seller
to consummate the Closing (the "Financing Certificate").

(g) No Financing Source will have any liability to the Buyer or its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Bridge Loan or otherwise,
whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any of
Financing Source hereunder or thereunder. The Buyer (i) agrees not to bring or
permit any of its Affiliates to bring any Action or Proceeding in any court
other than a state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New
York, and any appellate court thereof, (ii) hereby waives for itself and its
Affiliates any right to trial by jury in respect of any such Action or
Proceeding and (iii) any such Action or Proceeding shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules that would result in the application of
the laws of any other State. Any Financing Source is an express third party
beneficiary of, and may enforce, this provision and no amendment to this
provision may be made without the approval of the Financing Source.

 SECTION 6.7. Tax Matters.

(a) Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely file, or cause to
be timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary for
(i) any Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent such Tax Returns are first due
after the Closing Date and (ii) any Straddle Periods. Buyer shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, any such Tax Returns with respect to any Seller Taxes
that may be applied to offset any amounts due to Seller under Section 6.7(h)
herein to Seller for its review and comment at least fifteen (15) Business
Days prior to the due date for filing. Buyer shall accept any reasonable
written comments received from Seller with respect to such Tax Returns at
least ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date of any such Tax Return. If
Buyer and Seller cannot agree to any such comments within five (5) Business
Days prior to the due date of any such Tax Return, Buyer shall file such Tax
Return as prepared. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a
manner that is consistent with the past practices of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries unless (i) Buyer obtains a written opinion of nationally
recognized tax counsel that such past practice is not more likely than not to
be successfully defended in a judicial or administrative proceeding, (ii) such
past practice resulted in an adjustment by a Taxing Authority, or (iii)
otherwise required by law.

(b) The amount of any Tax refunds or credits relating to Seller Taxes applied
to offset any amounts due to Seller under Section 6.7(h) herein, that is
actually received or applied to offset any Taxes of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary attributable to a period after the Closing Date (net of any Tax
thereon) shall be for the account of Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, all
other refunds or credits shall be for the account of Buyer; provided that any
Tax refund or credit that results from amending a Tax Return to claim
Carryforward NOLs shall be considered an Annual Carryforward Tax Savings
subject to Section 6.7(h). Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller, or
to the order of Seller, the amount of such refund or credit that Seller is
entitled to under this Section 6.7(b) (net of any Tax thereon), within ten
(10) days after such refund is received or after such credit or refund is used
to offset another Tax liability, as the case may be.

(c) Buyer shall notify Seller, in writing within ten (10) Business Days after
the receipt by Buyer or the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any written
notice of any examination, audit, dispute or proceeding regarding any Seller
Taxes that could be applied to offset any amounts due to Seller under Section
6.7(h) herein (a "Tax Claim"), provided that the failure to timely or duly
give notice of a Tax Claim shall only affect the rights of Seller hereunder to
the extent such failure has a material and actual prejudicial effect on the
defenses or other rights available to Seller with respect to such Tax Claim.
Seller shall have the right to represent the interests of the Company and/or
any Company Subsidiary with respect to a Tax Claim , to the extent such Tax
Claim is solely in respect of Seller Taxes, and to take any actions in
connection with such Tax Claim, provided that (i) Seller gives written notice
to Buyer confirming that it will have access to adequate financial resources
to conduct the defense of such Tax Claim and (ii) Seller shall not enter into
any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Tax Claim without the
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Seller shall provide Buyer with notice of its
intention to assume the defense of any such Tax Claim and shall keep Buyer
fully and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature
of any such Tax Claim. Seller shall, in good faith, allow Buyer or Buyer's
counsel to consult with it regarding the

 conduct of, or positions taken in such Tax Claim, and shall allow Buyer to
fully participate in such Tax Claim. If Seller does not assume or is not
conducting the defense of any such Tax Claim actively and diligently, Buyer
may assume control of such Tax Claim and defend such Tax Claim in a manner as
it may deem appropriate including settling such Tax Claim, after giving notice
thereof to Seller, on such terms as Buyer may deem appropriate, provided that
Buyer shall not settle or cause the Company or any Company Subsidiary to
settle, without Seller's written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), any such Tax Claim the settlement of which
would adversely affect Seller (including by having amounts offset pursuant to
Section 6.7(h)). The provisions of Section 8.5 shall not be applicable to Tax
Claims subject to the provisions of this Section 6.7(c). To the extent Buyer
or Seller is not otherwise permitted to control a Tax Claim pursuant to this
Section 6.7(c), Buyer and Seller shall use (and cause their respective
Affiliates to use) their commercially reasonable efforts to separate from any
such Tax Claim any item that could result in Taxes that are not Seller Taxes,
and to permit, to the greatest extent possible, Buyer to control the contest
of any such item and Seller to control the contest relating to Seller Taxes;
provided that if any such matters cannot be conducted separately pursuant to
this sentence, the Party with the greater potential Tax Liability will control
the Tax Claim subject to the other Party's participation rights, in each case
pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.7(c).

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) Seller and Buyer
shall each bear fifty percent (50%) of any Transfer Taxes incurred as a result
of the purchase and sale of the Shares and (ii) Seller shall bear all Transfer
Taxes incurred in connection with the Restructuring (other than the purchase
and sale of the Shares). Such Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the party
legally responsible to pay such Transfer Taxes (with the other party paying
the party that is legally responsible to pay the Tax its share of such Tax at
least three (3) Business Days before the Tax payment due date). Both Seller
and Buyer will join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation as required by Law.

(e) After the Closing Date, each of Seller and Buyer shall reasonably
cooperate (and cause their respective Affiliates to reasonably cooperate) in:
(i) preparing any Tax Returns or reports of or with respect to the Company or
any Company Subsidiary which such other party is responsible for preparing and
filing, (ii) preparing for any audits of, or disputes with Taxing Authorities
regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (iii)
making available to the other and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and (iv) furnishing the other with
copies of all correspondence received from any Taxing Authority in connection
with any Tax audit or information request with respect to Taxes for which the
other party may be liable under this Agreement.

(f) (i) Buyer and its Affiliates shall not make any election with respect to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary under Section 338 of the Code, and (ii)
at Seller's request, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable,
shall make elections (and enter into agreements required to make such
elections) under Section 362(e)(2) of the Code or Treasury Regulations section
1.1502-36(d) with respect to Steps 9, 10, and 11 of the Restructuring.

 (g) So long as Buyer can offset Seller Taxes against the Annual Carryforward
Payment Amount otherwise payable pursuant to Section 6.7(h), if Buyer, its
Affiliates, the Company or any Company Subsidiary amends after the Closing any
Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary without the prior written consent of the
Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, any
incremental Taxes from any such amendment shall not be included in Seller
Taxes; provided however, that such amendment in respect of any incremental
Taxes is not the result of a successful challenge by a Taxing Authority.

(h)

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

(A) The "Annual Carryforward Payment Amount" with respect to a taxable year
shall mean an amount (not less than zero) equal to (I) the sum of (x) 100% of
the Annual Carryforward Tax Savings for such taxable year until an aggregate
amount equal to $60,000,000 has been taken into account pursuant to this
clause (x) with respect to such taxable year and any prior taxable years, (y)
50% of any Annual Carryforward Tax Savings not taken into account pursuant to
clause (x) and (z) 100% of any Tax savings relating to any U.S. federal Tax
deductions associated with any Employee Payments included as an asset in
Working Capital (such Tax savings calculated under principles similar to the
calculation of Annual Carryforward Tax Savings, with such deductions replacing
Carryforward NOLs), less (II) the amount of any Seller Taxes arising after the
Closing Date that has not previously reduced an Annual Carryforward Payment
Amount pursuant to this clause (II), less (III) the amount of any Disallowed
Carryforward Amount that has not previously reduced an Annual Carryforward
Payment Amount pursuant to this clause (III); provided, however, that the
Annual Carryforward Amount shall equal $0 with respect to all taxable years
subsequent to the last taxable year in which there are U.S. federal net
operating losses which are a part of the Carryforward NOLs for such taxable
year.

(B) The "Annual Carryforward Tax Savings" for a taxable year means the excess
of (I) the cumulative liability for Taxes of Parent, Buyer, the Company and
their Affiliates for such taxable year, calculated with the Carryforward NOLs
claimed in such taxable year excluded over (II) the actual cumulative
liability for Taxes of Parent, Buyer, the Company and their Affiliates for
such taxable year, calculated with the Carryforward NOLs claimed in such
taxable year included.

(C) "Carryforward NOLs" means any U.S. federal and state net operating losses
and credit carryforwards of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date that are available after the Closing Date for use by Parent, Buyer, the
Company or their Affiliates. Carryforward NOLs shall be deemed to include any
such U.S. federal and state net operating losses

 and credit carryforwards which become unavailable to be used after the Closing
Date as a result of a breach by Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates of any of
their covenants in this Agreement. Carryforward NOLs shall be computed without
regard to any deductions for Bridge Loan Costs, and for the avoidance of
doubt, any Employee Payments, and any Taxes in respect of such Employee
Payments.

(D) "Disallowed Carryforward Amount" means the amount of any prior payment of
the Annual Carryforward Payment Amount that would not have been made if
Disallowed Carryforward NOLs had not been taken into account in determining
the Annual Carryforward Tax Savings. If there is a Disallowed Carryforward
Amount, the determination of any Annual Carryforward Payment Amount with
respect to subsequent taxable years shall be made as if such Disallowed
Carryforward Amount had not been made and the Disallowed Carryforward NOLs has
not been used.

(E) "Disallowed Carryforward NOLs" means any Carryforward NOLs previously
claimed resulting in an Annual Carryforward Tax Savings, the use of which is
subsequently, successfully challenged by a Taxing Authority.



(ii) (A) Buyer shall pay the Annual Carryforward Payment Amount with respect
to a taxable year to Seller, or to the order of Seller, not more than ten (10)
Business Days after Parent (or any successor entity that is part of the U.S.
federal consolidated group of which the Company is a member) receives from the
Internal Revenue Service a Closing Letter with respect to its Tax Return for
such taxable year under the Compliance Assurance Process; provided that Buyer
shall in no event pay the Annual Carryforward Payment Amount later than 180
days after the filing of any U.S. federal income Tax Return utilizing
Carryforward NOLs for such taxable year.

(B) If on the date of the payment of the Annual Carryforward Payment Amount
with respect to a taxable year, (x) there is an outstanding Tax Claim that if
sustained by the applicable Taxing Authority would result in Seller Taxes (the
amount of such Seller Taxes, the "Potential Seller Taxes") and/or (y) Parent,
Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates has received a written notice of
an examination, audit, dispute or proceeding challenging or questioning the
prior use of any Carryforward NOLs that if sustained by the applicable Taxing
Authority would result in Disallowed Carryforward NOLs and a Disallowed
Carryforward Amount (a "NOL Tax Claim" and the potential Disallowed
Carryforward Amount, the "Potential Disallowed Carryforward Amount"), Buyer
shall be entitled to reduce the Annual Carryforward Payment Amount that would
otherwise be payable to Seller by the sum of the amount of the Potential
Seller Taxes and the Potential

 Disallowed Carryforward Amount as reasonably determined by Buyer (the
aggregate amount of any such permitted reduction of the Annual Carryforward
Payment Amount, the "Holdback Amount"). On the resolution of any such Tax
Claim, Buyer shall pay to Seller the excess of (I) the portion of any Holdback
Amount relating to such Tax Claim over (II) the amount of Seller Taxes
resulting from such Tax Claim. Any amount of such Holdback Amount retained by
Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates shall be considered Seller Taxes that
reduced an Annual Carryforward Payment Amount. On the resolution of any such
NOL Tax Claim, Buyer shall pay to Seller the excess of (a) the portion of any
Holdback Amount relating to such NOL Tax Claim over (b) the amount of any
Disallowed Carryforward Amount resulting from such NOL Tax Claim. Any amount
of such Holdback Amount retained by Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates shall be
considered a Disallowed Carryforward Amount that reduced an Annual
Carryforward Payment Amount.

(iii) If, after the Closing Date, Parent, Buyer, the Company or any of their
Affiliates engage in a transaction that results in Parent, Buyer, the Company
or any of their Affiliates obtaining the benefit of any net operating losses
or credit carryforwards that would not have been available absent such
transaction ("Subsequently Acquired NOLs"), the Annual Carryforward Tax
Savings shall be calculated assuming the Subsequently Acquired NOLs do not
exist.

(iv) If, after the Closing Date, Parent, Buyer, the Company or their
Affiliates sell or otherwise dispose of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(or any successors thereto), such that any amount of Carryforward NOLs is not
subsequently available for use by Parent, Buyer, the Company or their
Affiliates as a result of such sale or disposition, Buyer shall make a payment
to Seller, or to the order of Seller, equal to the present value of the future
reductions in the Annual Carryforward Payment Amount that result from such
loss of Carryforward NOLs, calculated assuming (A) there would be sufficient
income to fully utilize any Carryforward NOLs available for use in each year,
(B) the Carryforward NOLs available for use in a particular year are used on
the due date for the applicable Tax Return for such year (without regard to
extensions), (C) the Tax rates for the year of the sale or other disposition
apply to all subsequent years, and (D) a discount rate of 10%.

(v)

(A) Upon Seller's request, Parent shall provide to Seller an officer's
certificate of Parent, signed by a responsible corporate officer, of the
Annual Carryforward Tax Savings realized by Parent, Buyer, the Company or any
of their Affiliates with respect to any particular taxable year, along with,
if applicable, an explanation to Seller, in sufficient detail, of why such
amount is less than the amount of Annual Carryforward Tax Savings that would
be realized if the full amount of Carryforward NOLs available for use in the
applicable taxable year were utilized at the highest applicable marginal tax
rate.

 (B) No more than ten (10) days after Parent (or any successor entity that is
parent of the U.S. federal consolidated group of which the Company is a
member) receives from the Internal Revenue Service a Closing Letter with
respect to a Tax Return utilizing Carryforward NOLs for such taxable year
under the Compliance Assurance Process, Parent (or such successor entity)
shall provide a copy of such Closing Letter to Seller (redacting any portions
not relevant to the Carryforward NOLs).

(C) At least sixty (60) days prior to filing the first U.S. federal income Tax
Return after the Closing Date utilizing Carryforward NOLs, Parent and Buyer
shall provide to Seller their calculation of the yearly limitation under
Section 382 of the Code applicable to the U.S. federal net operating losses
that are part of the Carryforward NOLs and any similar limitations applicable
to state net operating losses that are part of the Carryforward NOLs (the
"Carryforward Limitations"), including supporting materials and calculations.
Parent and Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall work
together in good faith to resolve any disputes regarding the determination of
the Carryforward Limitations; provided that any disputes shall be resolved by
a nationally recognized independent accountant mutually agreed by the parties
(the "Independent Accountant"). Neither Parent, Buyer, the Company or any of
their Affiliates shall be required to provide to Seller a copy of the filed
Tax Returns of Parent, Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates for any
taxable period for which Carryforward NOLs are claimed; provided, that if
there should be any dispute described in the preceding sentence, Parent,
Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates, as applicable, shall provide to
the Independent Accountant or other arbitrator copies of such Tax Returns
subject to an appropriate confidentiality agreement or arrangement reasonably
acceptable to Parent, Buyer, the Company or its Affiliates, as applicable, to
the extent necessary for the Independent Accountant or arbitrator, as the case
may be, to resolve such dispute. The parties shall share equally in any costs
and expenses of the independent Accountant.

(vi) The parties will work together, in good faith, between the date of this
Agreement and the Opening Conference for the Compliance Assurance Process in
respect of the taxable year in which the Closing occurs on a joint statement
of facts and law that best supports the amount and use of the Carryforward
NOLs (the "NOL Joint Statement"). Parent, Buyer and their Affiliates shall act
in accordance with the NOL Joint Statement in filing Tax Returns and in the
Compliance Assurance Process unless (and for the avoidance of doubt subject to
the procedures of Section 6.7(h)(vii)) either (i) Parent believes, in good
faith, that there is not "substantial authority" (as defined in Section 6662
of the Code and regulations thereunder) with respect to a particular amount of
the Carryforward NOLs or (ii) the IRS presents an argument or challenge in
respect of the use of an amount of the Carryforward NOLs that Parent believes,
in good faith, would result in a successful challenge by the IRS against the
use of such amount of Carryforward NOLs; provided that Parent, Buyer and their
Affiliates shall continue to act in accordance with the NOL Joint

 Statement to the extent not inconsistent with Parent's good faith
determination pursuant to this sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this Section shall be construed to allow Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates
to trade or offset any amount of Carryforward NOLs in determining any other
tax position.

(vii) Buyer, Parent, the Company and their Affiliates shall promptly notify
the Seller of any challenge by a Taxing Authority regarding the use of the
Carryforward NOLs or any other adverse development regarding the Carryforward
NOLs (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in the Compliance Assurance
Process or any audit, examination or other proceeding) (a "NOL Contest"). In
connection with any NOL Contest, Parent or Buyer shall (i) provide updates to
Seller of any material developments, (ii) provide Seller with reasonably
opportunity to review and comment on any written submissions to the Taxing
Authority (and consider any comments provided in good faith), and (iii)
consult with Seller in good faith regarding the defense of the NOL Contest.



SECTION 6.8. Director and Officer Liability. For a period of six years after
the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the
Company\'s or any of the Company Subsidiaries\' certificate or articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent governing documents relating to the
exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses of any officers and
directors (unless and to the extent required by Law).

SECTION 6.9. Restructuring. On the Closing Date prior to the Funding Time,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, effect Step 1 of the
Restructuring, and subject to the receipt of the proceeds of the Bridge Loan
as contemplated by Step 2(a) of the Restructuring, following the Funding Time,
Steps 2(b) through 11 of the Restructuring, in each case, in all material
respects in accordance with Exhibit A. The parties shall consult with each
other in good faith concerning the progress of steps incorporated within the
Restructuring and shall not materially amend or modify the steps set forth in
Exhibit A without each party's prior written consent. Seller and its
Affiliates shall not execute, deliver, amend, modify or terminate any
agreements or instruments relating to the Restructuring without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld,
delayed or conditioned. Furthermore, the parties agree to report for tax
purposes the steps of the Restructuring as provided in Exhibit A.

SECTION 6.10. Further Assurances. From time to time prior to the Closing, as
and when requested by any party hereto and at such requesting party's expense,
any other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be
taken, all such further or other actions as the requesting party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.11. Parent Guarantee. Parent hereby guarantees to Seller the timely
payment and performance of all obligations required to be paid or performed by
Buyer under this Agreement, both before and after Closing (such obligations,
the "Guaranteed Obligations"). This guarantee by Parent is an absolute,
unconditional, continuing and irrevocable guaranty by Parent

 of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing, is in no way
conditioned upon any requirement that any member of the Seller Group first
attempt to collect or enforce any of the Guaranteed Obligations from Buyer or
upon any other condition or contingency whatsoever and shall remain in full
force and effect until all Guaranteed Obligations are indefeasibly performed
in full and paid in cash. Parent hereby waives presentment, protest, notice,
dishonor or default, demand for payment and any other notices to which Parent
might otherwise be entitled and any legal or equitable defenses to the
enforcement of this guarantee.

SECTION 6.12. Other Seller Covenants.

(a) On the Closing Date and prior to the Funding Time, Seller shall cause (i)
Apria Healthcare Group Inc. and Coram LLC to execute and deliver, each to the
other, the Amended and Restated IT Transition Services Agreement (to be
effective as of and, subject to, the Closing) and (ii) Apria Healthcare LLC
and Coram LLC to execute and deliver, each to the other, the Amended and
Restated Operational Transition Services Agreement (to be effective as of and,
subject to, the Closing).

(b) Seller and Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Escrow Agent to execute and deliver, on the Closing Date and prior to the
Funding Time, the Escrow Agreement, and shall execute and deliver the same to
the other at such time.

(c) Seller hereby assigns, and shall cause each of its Affiliates (other than
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to assign, effective at the Closing,
to Buyer all of its right, title and interest in and to any confidentiality
agreements entered into by Seller or each such Affiliate (other than the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) with any Person in connection with the
proposed sale of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the extent such
rights related to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and, to the extent
any such rights may not be assigned, Seller undertakes to, and shall cause
each of its Affiliates to, enforce any such rights at the request and
direction of Buyer and at Buyer's expense. True and complete copies of all
such confidentiality agreements shall be provided to Buyer at Closing.

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, AHG will assign its obligation under the
Transaction and Management Fee Agreement (the "Transaction and Management Fee
Agreement") dated as of October 28, 2008 with Blackstone Management Partners V
L.L.C. ("BMP") to the Company to pay the "Lump Sum Fee" (as defined therein)
to BMP at the Closing upon receipt of written notice from BMP of its election
under Section 4(f) and its consent to such assignment, and such amount will be
treated as a Transaction Expense hereunder.

SECTION 6.13. Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation.

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending two (2) years
following the Closing (the "Restricted Period"), neither Seller nor AHG, nor
any of their respective Subsidiaries (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), shall directly or indirectly,
without the prior written consent of Buyer, engage in, or manage, operate,
Control, make an investment in or own an equity interest in, any entity that
is engaged in, a Competing Business; provided that this Section 6.13(a) shall
not prohibit (i) the acquisition of an equity interest

 up to (but not more than) 5% in any publicly-traded Person whose equity
interests are listed on a nationally or internationally recognized securities
exchange; (ii) the acquisition of any entity or enterprise engaged in a
Competing Business, so long as Seller (or AHG or any other relevant
Subsidiary) shall not materially expand such Competing Business during the
Restricted Period and so long as Seller (or AHG or any other relevant
Subsidiary) gives Buyer an option to purchase the Competing Business at fair
market value within six (6) months following the acquisition; (iii) Seller's
or its Subsidiaries' activities under the Ancillary Agreements or any other
Contracts with the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or (iv)
engagement in a Competing Business if (1) Seller (or AHG or any other relevant
Subsidiary) or substantially all of its (or AHG's or any other relevant
Subsidiary's) assets is acquired by an unrelated company or enterprise already
involved in a Competing Business that does not derive more than fifteen
percent (15%) of its total revenues from such Competing Business, and (2) the
purchaser consolidates Seller's (or AHG's or any other relevant Subsidiary's)
operations with its own (including the Competing Business). For the avoidance
of doubt, in the event that Seller (or AHG or any other relevant Subsidiary)
is acquired by a purchaser that either is not engaged in a Competing Business,
or which derives more than fifteen percent (15%) of its net revenues from a
Competing Business, then the restrictions of this Section 6.13(a) shall
continue to apply to Seller, AHG and their respective Subsidiaries, though not
to the acquiring company or its other Affiliates.

(b) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending one (1) year
following the Closing, (A) neither Seller nor AHG shall (and shall each ensure
that none of its Subsidiaries (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) shall), directly or indirectly, (i)
induce, encourage, persuade or solicit any employee of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to terminate his or her employment with the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or accept any other position or employment with Seller, AHG
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and (ii) hire or assist any other
Person in hiring, as an officer, employee, consultant, independent contractor
or otherwise, any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who has
left such employment, except pursuant to a general solicitation which is not
directed specifically to any such employee; provided, however, that nothing in
this Section 6.13(b) shall prevent Seller, AHG or any of their respective
Subsidiaries from hiring any employee whose employment was terminated by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or the employee after 180 days from the date
of termination, and (B) Buyer and its Affiliates shall not, and shall ensure
that none of their respective Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) shall, directly or
indirectly, (i) induce, encourage, persuade or solicit any employee of the
Seller or any of Seller Subsidiary (the "Covered Employees"), to terminate his
or her employment with the Seller or any of Seller's Subsidiaries or accept
any other position or employment with Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, and
(ii) hire or assist any other Person in hiring, as an officer, employee,
consultant, independent contractor or otherwise, any Covered Employee who has
left such employment, except pursuant to a general solicitation which is not
directed specifically to any such employee; provided, however, that nothing in
this Section 6.13(b) shall prevent Buyer, its Affiliates, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries from hiring any Covered Employee whose employment was
terminated by Seller or any of Seller's Subsidiaries or the Covered Employee
after 180 days from the date of termination.

 (c) The parties acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this Section
6.13 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of each
party and constitute a material inducement to each party to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the event that any covenant contained in this Section 6.13 should ever be
adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court is
expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be deemed
reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic, product or
service, or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The covenants
contained in this Section 6.13 and each provision hereof are severable and
distinct covenants and provisions. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
such covenant or provision as written shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable the remaining covenants or provisions hereof, and any such
invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 8.1. Survival. The representations and warranties of the parties and
such covenants and agreements of the parties that require performance prior to
Closing will survive the Closing and will remain in full force and effect
thereafter until the Final Survival Date (or, with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in the last sentence of Section
4.11(d), until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations), upon
which they will terminate and have no further force and effect, and any claim
for indemnity in respect thereof made by an Indemnified Party under Section
8.2 or Section 8.3 in accordance with the terms of this Article VIII prior to
the Final Survival Date (or, with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in the last sentence of Section 4.11(d), prior to the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations), will survive beyond such
date until such time as it is finally resolved; provided that the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.9 (other than Section
4.9(l), which will remain in full force and effect until the Final Survival
Date) shall terminate at Closing and shall have no further force and effect.
All covenants and agreements that require or contemplate performance at or
after the Closing shall survive for a period of thirty (30) days following the
date on which the performance of such covenant is required to be made, and any
claim for indemnity in respect thereof made by an Indemnified Party under
Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 in accordance with the terms of this Article VIII
prior to the expiration of such survival period will survive until such time
as it is finally resolved. The right of a Person to any remedy pursuant to
this Article VIII shall not be affected by any investigation or examination
conducted, or any knowledge possessed or acquired, by such Person at any time
concerning any circumstance, action, omission or event relating to the
accuracy or performance of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation, or by the satisfaction or waiver of any Closing condition
contained in this Agreement.

SECTION 8.2. Indemnification by Seller. From and after the Closing, and from

Company Subsidiaries), and their respective directors, officers,
equityholders, partners, members, attorneys, accountants, agents,
representatives and employees and their heirs, successors and permitted
assigns, each in their capacities as such (the "Buyer Indemnified Parties"),
from, against and with respect to any damages, losses, charges, Liabilities,
claims, demands, actions, suits, judgments, settlements, awards, interest,
penalties, fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements) (collectively, "Losses") sustained or incurred by any Buyer
Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from or otherwise in respect of
(a) the failure of any representation or warranty of the Seller Parties
contained in Article III or Article IV of this Agreement (other than those set
forth in Section 4.9 (a) through (k) and (m), which terminate at the Closing,
but including those set forth in Section 4.9(l), which will remain in full
force and effect until the Final Survival Date) to be true and correct as of
the Closing (or, with respect to representations and warranties that by their
terms refer to a specific date, as of such

 specific date), it being understood that in determining whether any such
representation or warranty failed to be true and correct, such representation
and warranty (other than those set forth in Section 4.6(d)(ii)) shall be
considered without regard to any qualifications or limitations as to
"materiality", "Seller Material Adverse Effect" or "Company Material Adverse
Effect" set forth therein) or (b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of
Seller or any of its Affiliates (which, until the Closing, shall include the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) contained in this Agreement. From and
after the Closing, Seller and AHG shall, jointly and severally (subject to
Section 8.8(b)), indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified

any Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from or otherwise in
respect of (c) any Apria Liabilities, (d) any breach by Apria Healthcare LLC

respective directors, officers, equityholders, partners, members, attorneys,
accountants, agents, representatives and employees and their heirs, successors
and permitted assigns, each in their capacities as such (the "Seller
Indemnified Parties" and, collectively with Buyer Indemnified Parties, the
"Indemnified Parties"), from, against and with respect to any Losses sustained
or incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting from or
otherwise in respect of (a) the failure of any representation or warranty of
Buyer contained in Article V of this Agreement to be true and correct as of
the Closing (or, with respect to representations and warranties that by their
terms refer to a specific date, as of such specific date), it being understood
that in determining whether any such representation or warranty failed to be
true and correct, such representation and warranty shall be considered without
regard to any qualifications or limitations as to "materiality" or "Buyer
Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein), (b) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (which following the Closing,
shall include the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) contained in this
Agreement, (c) any Coram Liabilities or (d) any breach by Coram LLC of any
covenant, representation or warranty under the Contribution Agreements.

SECTION 8.4. Certain Limits to Indemnification.

(a) Neither Seller shall be liable to Buyer Indemnified Parties, nor shall
Buyer be liable to any Seller Indemnified Parties, for any Losses (i) with
respect to the matters described in Section 8.2(a), (c), (d) or (e) or Section
8.3(a), (c) or (d), respectively, unless a written claim or demand for
indemnification with respect to such matters is submitted by the applicable
Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party in accordance with the
terms of this Article VIII, on or prior to the Final Survival Date (or, with
respect to any breach of the representations and warranties set forth in the
last sentence of Section 4.11(d), on or prior to the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations), or (ii) with respect to the matters
described in Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.3(b), respectively, unless a written
claim or demand for indemnification with respect to such matters is submitted
by the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party in
accordance with the terms of this Article VIII, on or prior to the lapse of
the relevant survival period set forth in Section 8.1. AHG shall not be liable
to any Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses with respect to matters
described in Section 8.2(c), (d) or (e), unless a written claim or demand for
indemnification

 with respect to such matters is submitted by the Buyer Indemnified Party, on
or prior to the Final Survival Date (or, with respect to any breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in the last sentence of Section
4.11(d), on or prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations).

(b) Seller shall not be liable under Section 8.2 to any Buyer Indemnified
Parties, nor shall Buyer be liable under Section 8.3 to any Seller Indemnified
Parties, respectively, for any Losses with respect to the matters contained in
(i) Section 8.2(a), other than the Seller Fundamental Representations and
Warranties and the representations and warranties set forth in the last
sentence of Section 4.11(d), Section 4.16 (Related Party Transactions) and
Section 4.21(a) (Sufficiency of Assets), or (ii) Section 8.3(a), other than
the Buyer Fundamental Representations and Warranties, unless such respective
Losses exceed an aggregate amount equal to $10,000,000 (the respective
"Deductible Amount") in which case Seller shall be liable to the Buyer
Indemnified Parties and Buyer shall be liable to the Seller Indemnified
Parties only for those Losses in excess of its respective Deductible Amount.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall not be liable
under Section 8.2 to any Buyer Indemnified Parties, nor shall Buyer be liable
under Section 8.3 to any Seller Indemnified Parties, respectively, for any
Losses in excess of the Cap, other than (x) in the case of any breach of any
obligation to pay any purchase price adjustment when due pursuant to Section
2.5(d), (y) claims against Seller pursuant to Section 8.2(c), (d) or (e), or
(z) claims against Buyer pursuant to Section 8.3(c) or (d). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Losses arising out of the same facts and circumstances with respect
to the matters contained in Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.3(a) shall not be
entitled to indemnification under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 and shall not be
counted toward satisfaction of the Deductible Amount unless they exceed
$50,000. For the avoidance of doubt, AHG's indemnification obligations under
Section 8.2(c), (d) or (e) shall not be limited to the Cap and shall not be
subject to any limitations regarding the Deductible Amount or the $50,000 per
claim amount referred to in this Section 8.4(b).

(c) With respect to each indemnification obligation contained in this
Agreement, the amount of each Loss shall be determined net of any Tax benefit
actually realized in the taxable period in which such Loss is incurred by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates as a result of sustaining such Loss.

(d) Seller shall not be liable to any Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses
relating to the loss or unavailability of any Tax attribute (including,
without limitation, any net operating loss, deduction, credit, or Tax basis).

SECTION 8.5. Third-Party Claim Indemnification Procedures.

(a) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an indemnifying
party hereunder (an "Indemnifying Party") may have liability to any
Indemnified Party hereunder, is asserted against or sought to be collected
from any Indemnified Party by a third party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party promptly, but in no
event more than thirty (30) days following such Indemnified Party's receipt of
a Third-Party Claim, a written notice of claim specifying its good faith
estimate of the U.S. dollar amount of such claim, to the extent then
ascertainable (the "Claim Amount"), and describing in reasonable detail the
basis upon which the Indemnified Party asserts that such claim is required to
be satisfied (the "Claim

 Basis") (such notice, a "Claim Notice") and a copy of such Third-Party Claim;
provided that the failure to timely or duly give a Claim Notice shall only
affect the rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder to the extent such failure
has a material prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to
the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly following
the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third-Party Claim.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
that it elects to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by
appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and control
such defense at its expense, it being understood that, by assuming the defense
of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall conclusively acknowledge
and agree that it has an indemnity obligation with respect to such Third-Party
Claim. Once the Indemnifying Party has made such election, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in any such defense and to employ
separate counsel of its choosing at such Indemnified Party's expense;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall bear the cost of the
Indemnified Party's separate counsel if in the reasonable opinion of counsel
to the Indemnified Party an actual or a potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that makes such separate
representation advisable and/or conduct of claim by the Indemnifying Party
would compromise any legal privilege or similar doctrine with respect to the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to direct or assume
control of the defense against a Third-Party Claim if (i) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal, civil or
regulatory proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (ii)
the claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified
Party (or against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, if the Indemnified
Party is a Buyer Indemnified Party), and/or (iii) the Third-Party Claim
materially exceeds the balance of the Indemnifying Party's indemnity
obligations hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any Third-Party Claim if the terms of such settlement do not
contain a release of the Indemnified Parties or would result in (i) the
imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would restrict the
future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party, (ii) a finding or
admission of a violation of Law by the Indemnified Party, or (iii) any
monetary liability of the Indemnified Party that will not be paid or
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not settle,
compromise or discharge such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying
Party's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(c) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably
cooperate in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party
Claim, including by providing reasonable access to each other's relevant books
and records, and employees. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying
Party of books and records and information that are reasonably relevant to
such Third-Party Claim, and making employees and Representatives available on
a mutually convenient

 basis during normal business hours to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable best efforts to avoid production of
confidential information (consistent with applicable Law), and to cause all
communications among employees, counsel and others representing any party to a
Third-Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client
or work-product privileges.

SECTION 8.6. Direct Claim Indemnification Procedures. Each Indemnified Party
may assert, in good faith, any bona fide claim on account of any Losses which
do not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") by delivering to the
Indemnifying Party reasonably promptly (and, in any event, no later than
thirty (30) days following the Indemnified Party's determination to make a
claim under this Article VIII) a Claim Notice in respect thereof; provided
that the failure to timely or duly give a Claim Notice shall only affect the
rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder to the extent such failure has a
material prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Direct Claim.

SECTION 8.7. Investigation by Indemnifying Parties. In connection with any
claim pursuant to this Article VIII:

(a) The parties to this Agreement shall allow, and shall cause their
Affiliates to allow, the Indemnifying Party and its financial, accounting or
legal advisers to investigate the fact, matter or circumstance alleged to (or
which may) give rise to such claim and whether and to what extent any amount
is or may be payable in respect of such claim.

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall disclose to the others all material of
which it is aware which relates to the claim and shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and all of their respective employees and financial, accounting and
legal advisors to, provide such information and assistance as the other
parties or their financial, accounting or legal advisers shall reasonably
request, including:

(i) reasonable access to premises and personnel (including any employee with
knowledge relating to the relevant facts, matters or circumstances or who can
otherwise reasonably assist the requesting party); and

(ii) the right to examine and copy or photograph any relevant assets,
accounts, correspondence, documents and records, subject to reasonable
accommodation to address confidentiality and attorney-client privilege
concerns.

SECTION 8.8. Limitations on Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement:

(a) No Indemnifying Party shall be liable to pay any amount in discharge of a
Third-Party Claim or Direct Claim unless and until the Loss in respect of
which the claim is made has become due and payable; provided that an
Indemnified Party may timely deliver a Claim Notice or Direct Claim for a Loss
without regard to whether such Loss is then due and payable. The parties shall
cause their representatives to meet, confer and negotiate in good faith in
order to resolve Third-Party Claims and Direct Claims pending as of the Final
Survival Date.

 (b) Neither a Buyer Indemnified Party, nor the Buyer Indemnified Parties as a
group or class, shall be entitled to recover from Seller and AHG,
collectively, pursuant to this Article VIII (or otherwise, including pursuant
to Section 2.5 or Section 6.7) more than once in respect of the same Losses
suffered. Neither a Seller Indemnified Party, nor the Seller Indemnified
Parties as a group or class, shall be entitled to recover from Buyer pursuant
to this Article VIII (or otherwise, including pursuant to Section 2.5) more
than once in respect of the same Losses suffered.

(c) No Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this Article VIII for any
punitive or exemplary damages except to the extent awarded to a Person other
than the Indemnified Party pursuant to a Third-Party Claim.

SECTION 8.9. Adjustments to Losses.

(a) Reserves and Provisions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
in calculating the amount of any Loss for which any Buyer Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification hereunder, the amount of any reserve, other
negative provision or Loss reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet and to
the extent specifically related to the facts of such Loss shall be deducted.

(b) Reimbursement. If any Indemnified Party or the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries actually recovers (whether by payment, discount, credit, relief,
insurance or otherwise) from a third party a sum which indemnifies or
compensates such Indemnified Party or the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
(in whole or in part) in respect of any Loss which is the subject matter of
the claim, such Indemnified Party shall reduce or satisfy, as the case may be,
the Losses in respect of such claim to the extent of such actual recovery or,
if an indemnification payment in respect of such Loss had been previously
paid, should pay over the amount of such recovery to the Indemnifying Party.

SECTION 8.10. Characterization of Indemnification Payments/Carryforward NOL
Payments. All payments made (or deemed to be made, in accordance with this
Agreement) by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party with respect to
any claim pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, and payments made pursuant
to Section 8.12 or Section 6.7(h), shall be treated, to the fullest extent
possible under applicable Law, as adjustments to the Initial Equity Purchase
Price or additional purchase price for Tax purposes.

SECTION 8.11. Mitigation. Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any indemnifiable Loss.

SECTION 8.12. Payment.

(a) If any Buyer Indemnified Party delivers to Seller any Claim Notice
pursuant to Section 8.5 or Section 8.6 (each, a "Buyer Claim Notice"), then
Buyer shall provide to the Escrow Agent of copy of such Buyer Claim Notice.
Upon receipt of a copy of the Buyer Claim Notice from Buyer, the Escrow Agent
shall, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, set aside and hold as a reserve to
cover the Third-Party Claim or Direct Claim in respect of which such Buyer
Claim Notice was delivered (each, a "Buyer Indemnity Claim") such portion of
the Escrow Amount equal to the

 Claim Amount set forth in such Buyer Claim Notice, until there is a final
resolution of such Buyer Indemnity Claim.

(b) In the event a claim for indemnification under this Article VIII shall
have been finally determined, the amount of the related Loss, if such Loss is
owed to a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or (b), shall be
paid by means of release of all or part of the Escrow Amount pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement. In the event that such Loss is owed to a Buyer Indemnified
Party pursuant to Section 8.2(c), (d) or (e), the Loss shall be paid, at the
Buyer Indemnified Party's option, either by means of release of all or part of
the Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement or by wire transfer by AHG
to such Buyer Indemnified Party of immediately available funds, within three
(3) Business Days after such final determination. In the event that such Loss
is owed to a Seller Indemnified Party, the Loss shall be paid by Buyer, to
such Seller Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, within three (3) Business Days after such final determination. Any
payments required to be made by Seller or AHG to any Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 8.2 shall not be offset against any payments required to
be made by Buyer to any Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.3, and
any payments required to be made by Buyer to any Seller Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 8.3, shall not be offset against any payments required to
be made by Seller or AHG to any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
8.2. Any claim, the Indemnifying Party's liability therefor and the amount of
the related Losses shall be "finally determined" or "finally resolved" when
the parties to such claim have so determined by mutual written agreement or,
if disputed, when a Final Judgment shall have been entered concerning such
matters. Any amounts due under this Section 8.12 which are not paid when due
shall bear interest from such due date until paid at the prime rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition on the due date.

SECTION 8.13. Remedies. From and after the Closing, (a) the rights and
remedies of Buyer and Seller, and any Indemnified Party, under this Article
VIII are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and remedies for
monetary relief which Buyer and Seller, and any Indemnified Party, may have
under this Agreement or otherwise against each other (or any of their
respective Affiliates) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) Buyer and Seller each expressly waives and releases
and agrees to waive and release any and all other rights or causes of action
for monetary relief it or its Affiliates may have against the other party or
its Affiliates now or in the future under any Law or otherwise with respect
thereto, provided that the limitations set out in this Section 8.13 shall not
apply (i) prior to the occurrence of the Closing, (ii) in the case of actual
fraud or (iii) in respect of any (x) breaches of any obligation to pay any
purchase price adjustment when due pursuant to Section 2.5(d), (y) breaches of
the undertakings provided in Section 6.13, or (z) obligations under the
Ancillary Agreements (other than the Contribution Agreements) or the
Assignment Agreements.

 ARTICLE IX

SECTION 9.1. Termination. This Agreement may be validly terminated only as
follows (it being understood and hereby agreed that this Agreement may not be
terminated for any other reason or on any other basis):

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and the Seller Parties at any time
prior to the Closing;

(the "Initial Termination Date"); provided that if prior to the Initial

"Termination Date"); provided, further, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to any party

permanently prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by

be satisfied, and (ii) such breach or failure to perform or inaccuracy cannot
be cured by the Seller Parties or, if capable of being cured, shall not have
been cured within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Seller Parties of
notice in writing from Buyer, specifying the nature of such breach and
requesting that it be cured; provided that Buyer shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if it is then in
breach of any of its covenants set forth in this Agreement that would result
in the closing conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 (other than
those conditions which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing
Date) not being satisfied; or

(e) by the Seller Parties, by written notice to Buyer, if Buyer has breached
or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements set forth in
this Agreement or if any

 representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement shall be or
shall have become inaccurate, in either case (i) such that the conditions set
forth in Section 7.3 would not be satisfied and (ii) such breach or failure to
perform or inaccuracy cannot be cured by Buyer or, if capable of being cured,
shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after receipt by Buyer of
notice in writing from the Seller Parties, specifying the nature of such
breach and requesting that it be cured; provided that the Seller Parties shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(e)
if any of them is then in breach of any of its covenants set forth in this
Agreement that would result in the closing conditions set forth in Section 7.1
or Section 7.2 (other than those conditions which by their terms cannot be
satisfied until the Closing Date) not being satisfied.

SECTION 9.2 Termination Fee

If (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Seller Parties or by Buyer pursuant

Section 7.1(a), or (y) Section 9.1(b) as the result of a failure of the
condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) resulting from any Antitrust Law, any
Prohibitive Order enforcing any Antitrust Law, or any Action or Proceeding
seeking to enforce any Antitrust Law, or (z) Section 9.1(c) as the result of a
Prohibitive Order enforcing any Antitrust Law, and (ii) all of the conditions
to Closing set forth in Section 7.2 (A) (a), 7.2 (A) (b) and 7.2 (A) (h) would
be satisfied if the Funding Time and the time of such termination were
identical, then (p) Buyer shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days following such termination, pay to, or to the order of, Seller a
termination fee of $25,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"), payable by wire
transfer of same day funds and (q) (a) the right of Seller to receive payment
of the Termination Fee under this Section 9.2 shall be exclusive and in lieu
of any and all other rights and remedies for any monetary, injunctive or other
relief which any of the Seller Parties or any of their respective Affiliates
may have under this Agreement or otherwise against Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and (b) each Seller Party expressly waives and releases and agrees to waive
and release any and all other rights or causes of action for any monetary,
injunctive or other relief it or its Affiliates may have against Buyer or its
Affiliates now or in the future under any Law or otherwise with respect
thereto.

Representatives or Affiliates) shall have any liability to any other Person;
provided that (i) the obligations of the parties hereto contained in this
Section 9.3, Article X and the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and (ii) except as provided in Section 9.2,
nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability or damages to the

breach of any covenant or agreement made by such party (including the
agreement to effect the Closing).

both written and oral, between or on behalf of the parties hereto with respect

 SECTION 10.4. Publicity. No party or Subsidiary of such party shall issue or
cause the publication of any press release or public announcement in respect
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
written consent of Seller and Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld), except as may be required by Law or stock exchange rules, in which
the case the party required to publish such press release or public
announcement shall allow the other party a reasonable opportunity to comment
on such press release or public announcement in advance of such publication;
provided, further, that neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make
any announcement or communication to any employees, customers and other
business relations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in respect of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without Buyer's prior
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

SECTION 10.5. Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement or any
Exhibit hereto or the Disclosure Schedules may be amended or waived if, and
only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and duly executed, in the case
of an amendment, by all parties hereto, or in the case of a waiver, by the
party against whom the waiver is to be effective. Any waiver of any term or
condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a
subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term
or condition of this Agreement. No failure or delay by any party in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

SECTION 10.6. Parties in Interest; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as
provided in Article VIII with respect to Indemnified Parties or Section 6.6(g)
with respect to the Financing Sources, this Agreement is for the sole benefit
of the parties to this Agreement and their successors and permitted assigns
and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person, any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified
period, under or by reason of this Agreement.

SECTION 10.7. Assignment; Binding Effect. This Agreement shall not be assigned
by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of Seller
and Buyer, except that Seller and Buyer may assign any or all its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries so
long as such wholly owned Subsidiary agrees in writing to be bound by all of
the terms, conditions and provisions contained herein; provided that no such
assignment shall release Seller or Buyer from any liability or obligation
under this Agreement. Any attempted assignment in violation of this Section
10.7 shall be void. This Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the parties hereto and their
successors and permitted assigns.

SECTION 10.8. Section Headings. The article, section and paragraph headings
and table of contents contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

SECTION 10.9. Disclosure Schedules. If a disclosure is made in one of or in
any part of any of the Disclosure Schedules, such disclosure will be deemed to
have also been made in

 each other part of the Disclosure Schedules to the extent the relevance of
such disclosure to such other part of the Disclosure Schedules is reasonably
apparent on its face. The reference to or listing, description, disclosure or
other inclusion of any item or other matter, including any charge, violation,
breach, debt, obligation or liability, in the Disclosure Schedules shall not
be construed to be an admission or suggestion that such item or matter
constitutes a violation of, breach or default under, any contract, agreement,
note, lease or otherwise. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedules relating
to any possible breach or violation of any agreement, applicable Law or
regulation shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such
breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. Notwithstanding the use
of the terms "material," "Seller Material Adverse Effect," "Company Material
Adverse Effect" and "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" in this Agreement, the
inclusion of any particular disclosure in the attached Disclosure Schedules
shall not, of itself, mean that the item or matter so disclosed is material,
is required to be disclosed or would be likely to constitute a Seller Material
Adverse Effect, Company Material Adverse Effect or Buyer Material Adverse
Effect. Such disclosure shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the term
"material," "materially," "materiality," "Seller Material Adverse Effect,"
"Company Material Adverse Effect," "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" or any
similar qualification in this Agreement.

SECTION 10.10. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any provision
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions
hereof. If any provision of this Agreement (or any portion thereof), or the
application of any such provision (or any portion thereof), to any Person or
entity or any circumstance, is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any
court, (i) the parties hereto shall take any actions necessary to render the
remaining provisions of this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law and, to the extent necessary, shall amend
or otherwise modify this Agreement to replace any provision contained herein
that is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable with a valid, legal and
enforceable provision giving effect to the original intent of the parties
hereto and (ii) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other persons, entities or circumstances shall not be affected by
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability affect the validity, legality or enforceability
of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 10.11. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction.

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action based upon, arising out
of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws
of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or rules of
conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or
permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction.

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the exclusive
personal jurisdiction and venue of the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
New York County and the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York ("Applicable Courts") with respect to any suit (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it
will not,

 directly or indirectly, attempt to defeat or deny such personal jurisdiction
or venue by motion or otherwise, (iii) agrees that it will not, and it will
cause its Subsidiaries not to, bring or support any such suit in any court
other than such courts of the State of New York, as described above, (iv)
irrevocably agrees that any such suit (whether at law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) shall be heard and determined exclusively in such courts
of the State of New York, as described above, (v) agrees to service of process
in any such action in any manner prescribed by the Laws of the State of New
York.

SECTION 10.12. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH
PARTY (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (II)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS Section 10.12.

SECTION 10.13. Counterparts. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be
executed and delivered in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed to be an original by the party executing such counterpart, but all of
which shall be considered one and the same instrument. The execution and
delivery of the signature page, including the electronic delivery of the
actual signature, by any party will constitute the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by such party.

SECTION 10.14. Specific Performance Without intending to limit the remedies
available to the parties hereunder, the parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, will cause
irreparable injury to the other parties, for which damages, even if available,
will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereby consents to the
issuance of temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief by the
Applicable Courts to compel performance of such party's obligations, or to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to the granting
by the Applicable Courts of the remedy of specific performance of its
obligations hereunder, without, in any such case, the requirement to post any
bond or other undertaking, in addition to any other rights or remedies
available hereunder or at law or in equity. Each party agrees not to oppose
the granting of such injunctive relief on the basis that monetary damages are
an adequate remedy.

SECTION 10.15. No Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim, action, suit or other legal proceeding based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement, may only be brought against the persons or entities that are
expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. No past, present or
future

 director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other Representative of any party
hereto or of any Affiliate of any party hereto, or any of their successors or
permitted assigns, shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities
of any party hereto under this Agreement or, except in the case of actual
fraud, for any claim or Action based on, in respect of or by reason of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 10.16. Time for Performance. Time is of essence with regard to any
time, date or period set forth or referred to in this Agreement.
