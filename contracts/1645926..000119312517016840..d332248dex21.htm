Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.01. _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the
Bermuda Companies Act, at the Effective Time, (i) Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company such that the separate corporate existence of Merger
Sub shall thereupon cease, (ii) the Company shall be the surviving company in
the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ "), and (iii) the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and Section 109(2) of the Bermuda
Companies Act. As a result of the Merger, the Surviving Company shall become
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

Section 1.02. _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law) waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
ARTICLE VII, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place no
later than the third (3rd) Business Day after satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law) waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
ARTICLE VII that are susceptible to satisfaction prior to the Closing, at the
offices of Conyers Dill and Pearman Limited, Clarendon House, 2 Church Street,
Hamilton, Bermuda, unless another date or place is agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ". 

Section 1.03. _Effective Time_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall (a) on the Closing Date, execute and deliver
the Statutory Merger Agreement, (b) on or prior to the Closing Date, cause an
application for registration of the Surviving Company (the " _Merger
Application_ ") to be executed and delivered to the Registrar of Companies in
Bermuda (the " _Registrar_ ") as provided under Section 108 of the Bermuda
Companies Act and to be accompanied by the documents required by Section
108(2) of the Bermuda Companies Act and (c) cause to be included in the Merger
Application a request that the Registrar issue the certificate of merger with
respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") on the Closing Date
at the time of day mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent and set
forth in the Merger Application. The Merger shall become effective on the date
shown in the Certificate of Merger. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree
that they will request that the Registrar provide in the Certificate of Merger
that the effective date of the Merger be the Closing Date (the " _Effective
Time_ ").

 

Section 1.04. _Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws_. The memorandum of
association and bye-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the memorandum of association and bye-laws of
the Surviving Company, until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by Applicable Law (in each case, subject to Section 6.04).

 

Section 1.05. _Directors and Officers of Surviving Company_. The directors
of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after
the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Company, and the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the

 



2  Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of
the Surviving Company, in each case until their respective successors shall
have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

ARTICLE II

 

 _EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES_

 

Section 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or holders of any common shares, par value $1.00 per share,
of the Company (" _Company Shares_ ") or any common shares of Merger Sub ("
_Merger Sub Shares_ "):

 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding Merger Sub
Share shall be cancelled and converted into one fully paid and nonassessable
common share of the Surviving Company.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Treatment of
Stock Owned by Company Subsidiaries_.

(i) All Company Shares that are owned by the Company as treasury shares
and any Company Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(ii) All Company Shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company shall be automatically converted into such number
of common shares of the Surviving Company such that the ownership percentage
of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Company immediately following the
Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Each issued and outstanding Company
Share (other than Company Shares to be cancelled or converted in accordance
with Section 2.01(b) and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right
to receive $18.00 (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder
thereof in cash, without interest. Subject to Section 2.03, as of the
Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be issued and
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") or person entered as
the owner in a book-entry in respect of a share (a " _Book-Entry Share_ ")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pertaining to the Company Shares
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share upon the surrender
thereof in accordance with Section 2.02. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the issued and
outstanding Company Shares shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any bonus issue, share dividend,
subdivision, reclassification,

 



3  recapitalization, split, combination, consolidation or exchange of Company
Shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number or amount
contained herein which is based upon the number of Company Shares will be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ that with respect to outstanding awards made under the Company
Stock Plans, any such adjustments shall be made in accordance with the
applicable Company Stock Plan. Nothing in this Section 2.01(c) shall be
construed to permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited by this Agreement, including pursuant to Section
5.01(a).

Section 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company LLC as agent for the holders of
Company Shares in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and to
receive the consideration to which holders of Company Shares shall become
entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(c). At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the cash
necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration for the Company Shares
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). If for any reason the
Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of Company
Shares shall be entitled under Section 2.01(c), Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional cash with the Paying Agent
sufficient to make all payments of the aggregate Merger Consideration, and
Parent and the Surviving Company shall in any event be liable for
payment thereof.

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Company Shares whose shares are converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01 a form of letter of
transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, shall
be in such form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions
with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Book-Entry
Shares) as Parent may specify, subject to the Companys reasonable approval,
and shall be prepared prior to the Closing), together with instructions
thereto.

 

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i)
in the case of Company Shares represented by a Certificate, the surrender of
such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or (ii) in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, the receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent, in
each case together with the Letter of Transmittal, duly, completely and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Company Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration into which such Company Shares have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.01. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate
representing such Company

 



4  Shares (or, if such Company Shares are held in book-entry form, proper
evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each Company Share, and any Certificate
with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration that the holders of Company Shares are entitled to
receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01(c). No interest
shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate (or Book-Entry Shares).

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. Except as provided in Section
2.02(j), no cash payment with respect to the Merger Consideration shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate (or Book-Entry Shares)
until the surrender of such Certificate (or Book-Entry Shares) in accordance
with this ARTICLE II.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE II, upon
conversion of any Company Shares, shall be deemed to have been issued and paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares. From and
after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the register of members of the Surviving Company of Company Shares that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing Company Shares are
presented to Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this ARTICLE II, subject to
satisfaction of the terms, conditions and requirements set forth in Section
2.02(c).

(f) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Shares one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Shares who has
not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

 

(g) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment
Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares for two years after
the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the
Payment Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash
in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct
obligations of the United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term
commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard

 



5  and Poors Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$5 billion. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent. No investment losses resulting from investment of the
Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any shareholder of the Company to
receive the Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein.

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Company, and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any holder of Company Shares, Company Restricted Stock Awards or Company
Restricted Stock Unit Awards pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under Applicable Law with respect to Taxes. Amounts so withheld and
timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

(j) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, issue the Merger Consideration.

 

(k) _Uncertificated Shares_. If any Company Shares are held in
uncertificated form in a direct registration system (each, an "
_Uncertificated Share_ "), then promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to (i) mail to each holder of Uncertificated
Shares (other than Dissenting Shares) materials advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the conversion of its Uncertificated Shares
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and (ii) deliver the amount
of cash that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of its
Uncertificated Shares pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.02(i)), without interest
thereon.

 

Section 2.03. _Shares of Dissenting Holders_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist and, unless otherwise required by
Applicable Law, shall automatically be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and any holder of Dissenting Shares shall, in the event
that the fair value of a Dissenting Share as appraised by the Supreme Court
of Bermuda under Section 106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act (the " _Appraised
Fair Value_ ") is greater than the Merger Consideration, be entitled to
receive such difference from the Surviving Company by payment made
within thirty (30) days after such Appraised Fair Value is finally determined
pursuant to such appraisal procedure.

 

(b) In the event that a holder of Dissenting Shares fails to exercise,
effectively withdraws or otherwise waives any right to appraisal (each, an "
_Appraisal Withdrawal_ ") such holders Dissenting Shares shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist and shall automatically be converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive solely the Merger
Consideration for each such Dissenting Share.

 



6 (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) written notice of (A) any demands
for appraisal of Dissenting Shares, Appraisal Withdrawals and any other
instruments, notices, petitions or other written communication received by the
Company in accordance with this Section 2.03 and (B) to the extent that
the Company has Knowledge thereof, any applications to the Supreme Court of
Bermuda for appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and (ii) to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the right to participate in any
settlement negotiations and proceedings with respect to any demands for
appraisal under the Bermuda Companies Act. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to,
offer to settle or settle any such demands or applications, or waive any
failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or timely take any
other action to exercise appraisal rights in accordance with the Bermuda
Companies Act.

 

Section 2.04. _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards_ _and
Company Restricted Stock Awards_. 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering any Company Stock Plans) will take all actions as it
deems necessary or appropriate to give effect to this Section 2.04 to provide
that immediately prior to the Effective Time:

 

(i) Each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award that is subject to
performance-based vesting conditions and each Company Restricted Stock Award,
in each case that is then outstanding, shall be cancelled and terminated, and
each holder thereof shall have the right to receive from the Surviving
Company, in respect of such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award or
Company Restricted Stock Award, an amount in cash (less applicable
withholding Taxes, if any) equal to (x) the number of Company Shares subject
to such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award or Company Restricted Stock Award
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming, in the case of
Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards that are subject to performance-based
vesting conditions, that satisfaction of the performance goals as of the
Closing Date is calculated as set forth in the agreement governing such
Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards), multiplied by (y) the Merger
Consideration, payable through the Surviving Companys payroll systems
promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) following the
Closing Date; _provided_ that to the extent any amounts described in this
Section 2.04(a)(i) relate to a payment that is nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Surviving Company shall
pay such amounts at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the
applicable agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such payment that will
not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(ii) Each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award that is not subject to
performance-based vesting conditions that is then outstanding shall be
assumed by Parent and converted into an award of restricted stock units by
Parent (an " _Assumed Award_ ") with respect to a number of shares of common
stock of Parent, par value $0.01 per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), equal
to (i) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Restricted Stock

 



7  Unit Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii)
the Exchange Ratio (as defined below), rounded to the nearest whole share, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Restricted
Stock Unit Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Exchange Ratio_ " means a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the average
of the volume weighted average price per share of Parent Common Stock on the
New York Stock Exchange Inc. (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not
reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Parent
and the Company) on each of the five (5) consecutive trading days ending with
the second complete trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to (i) reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for issuance with respect to the Assumed Awards and (ii) cause
the registration of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to
the Assumed Awards to become effective as part of a registration statement on
Form S-8 or Form S-3 as the case may be, or any successor or other appropriate
forms, and, thereafter, Parent shall deliver to holders of Assumed Awards any
applicable prospectus and shall maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement, including the current status of any related
prospectus, for so long as the Assumed Awards remain outstanding.

_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) in no event shall any disclosure in any
Company SEC Documents apply to or qualify any representation or warranty in

deemed to apply to and qualify any representation or warranty in this ARTICLE
III only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that the description of
such matter in such Company SEC Document is relevant to the topic of such

delivered by the Company to Parent at or before the execution and delivery of
this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being understood

Company is an exempted company duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of Bermuda and has all requisite power and
authority necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the failure

Effect. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and, to the extent legally applicable, in good standing under

Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (where such
concept is recognized under Applicable Law) in each jurisdiction in which the
properties and assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such approvals, qualification or licensing
necessary, except, in the case of the Company and its Subsidiaries, where the
failure to be so duly approved, qualified or licensed and in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement a true, correct and
complete copy of the memorandum of association and bye-laws of the Company in

into this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement is in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders, (iii) declared this Agreement

authorize or adopt this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (except for the filing of the appropriate merger documents as
required by Applicable Law). The Company has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and

record date for, declared, set aside for payment or paid any dividend on, or

not prevent or materially delay or adversely affect the consummation of the
Merger.

 

Section 3.05. _Company SEC Documents_.

 

(a) The Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC all reports,
schedules, forms, statements, prospectuses and other documents required to be

together with any exhibits and schedules thereto and other information
incorporated therein (collectively, together with any documents filed
with the SEC during such period by the Company on a voluntary basis on a
Current Report on Form 8-K, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their
respective effective dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents that are

Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other
Company SEC Documents), the Company SEC Documents complied as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of SOX, the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC, applicable to such Company SEC Documents, and none of the Company
SEC Documents as of such respective dates (and, if amended, as of the date of
the filing of such amendment, with respect to the disclosures that are
amended) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



12 (b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company (including
the related notes) included or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Documents complied as to form, as of their respective dates of filing with the

of unaudited consolidated financial statements, as permitted by rules and
regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except (i) as may be indicated in the notes thereto or (ii) as
permitted by Regulation S-X) and fairly presented in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the case of

over financial reporting and accounting (including "internal control over

Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances (i) regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes, (ii) that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
consistently applied, (iii) that transactions are executed only in accordance
with the authorization of management and directors of the Company and (iv)
regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of the Companys properties or assets that could have a
material effect on the Companys financial statements. The Company has
designed and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance that material information (both financial and
non-financial) that is required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules
and forms and is accumulated and made known to its principal executive officer
and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of the Company to make the certifications required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

 

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, there was no outstanding Indebtedness
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, determined on a consolidated basis, other

Subsidiaries as of September 30, 2016, as disclosed in the Company SEC
Documents.

 

(e) Each of the chief executive officer of the Company and the chief
financial officer of the Company (or each former chief executive officer of
the Company and each former chief financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all applicable certifications required by Rule 13a-14

exchange offer by the shareholders of the Company (including, for these
purposes, by disclosing that it is taking no position with respect to the
acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by its shareholders, which

such tender offer or exchange offer (any of the foregoing, an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) authorize, adopt or approve or propose to
authorize, adopt or approve, an Acquisition Proposal, or cause or permit the
Company or its Subsidiaries to enter

 



35  into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, the
Company Board may (I) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company
Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, or
(II) if the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from
a material breach of Section 5.02(a) (or any material violation of the
restrictions set forth in Section 5.02(a) by any Representative of the
Company acting in its capacity as such) that the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, constitutes a
Superior Proposal, authorize, adopt, or approve such Superior Proposal and
cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company Board may only take the actions described in (x) clause (II) if the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d) concurrently
with entering into such Alternative Acquisition Agreement and pays the
applicable Termination Fee in compliance with Section 8.03(b) and (y) clause
(I) or (II) if:

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent of its or the
Company Boards intention to take such actions at least three (3) Business
Days in advance of taking such action, which notice shall specify (x) in the
case of a Superior Proposal, the material terms of the Superior Proposal and
shall include a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with, and
the identity of, the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, or (y) in cases
not involving a Superior Proposal, the material circumstances giving rise to
the Adverse Recommendation Change (and the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of any material developments with respect thereto);

 

(ii) after providing such notice and prior to taking such actions, the
Company shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during
such three (3) Business Day period to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Company or the Company Board
not to take such actions; and

(iii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any changes to
this Agreement or other arrangements that may be offered in writing by Parent
by 5:00 PM Eastern Time on the third (3rd) Business Day of such three (3)
Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith (A) with
respect to the actions described in clause (I), after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that it would continue to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law not to effect the Adverse
Recommendation Change and (B) with respect to the actions described in clause
(II), after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, that the Acquisition Proposal received
by the Company would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal, in each
case, if such changes offered in writing by Parent were given effect (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice in accordance with Section 5.02(d)(i) and
a new two (2) Business Day period).

 



36 (e) _Disclosure Obligations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent the Company or the Company Board from issuing a customary "stop, look
and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure to the Companys
shareholders if the Company Board concludes, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ that any Adverse
Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with Section 5.02(d).
For the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that
describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation
of this Agreement with respect thereto (without including such
reaffirmation) shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(f) _For purposes of this Agreement_ :

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any bona fide proposal or offer from
any Person or group of Persons (other than Parent or Merger Sub) providing
for (a) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, of (1) 20% or more (based on
the fair market value) of assets (including capital stock of the Companys
Subsidiaries) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2)
shares or other equity securities of the Company which together with any other
shares or other equity securities of the Company beneficially owned by such
person or group, would equal 20% or more of aggregate voting power of the
Company, (b) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in any Person or group owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of
the aggregate voting power of the Company, (c) any merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, business combination, joint venture, binding share exchange or
similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which any Person or
group (or the shareholders of any Person) would own, directly or indirectly,
20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the Company or of the surviving
or resulting entity in a merger or amalgamation or the resulting direct or
indirect parent of the Company or such surviving or resulting entity, (d) any
recapitalization transaction involving the Company or (e) any combination of
the foregoing, other than, in each case, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ _"_ means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal
from a Person or group of Persons (other than Parent or Merger Sub and any
entity that is a party to a Voting Agreement or any of its Affiliates) that,
if consummated, would result in such Person or group of Persons acquiring,
directly or indirectly, 100% of the voting power of the Company Shares
(excluding any Company Shares owned by management that are being rolled over)
or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and which the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside legal counsel) (x) is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms, (y) if consummated, would be more favorable from a
financial point of view to the holders of Company Shares than the Merger, in
each case, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and of this Agreement (including any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any fees to be
paid by the Company pursuant to Section 8.03) and (z) did not result from a
material breach of Section 5.02(a) or any material violation of the
restrictions set forth in Section 5.02(a) by any Representative of the
Company acting in its capacity as such.

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

 

Section 6.01. _Preparation and Mailing of the Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than the
twentieth (20th) Business Day) after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy statement
relating to the matters to be submitted to the shareholders of the Company at

supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Subject to Section 5.02, the
Company Board shall make the Company Recommendation to the Companys
shareholders and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response and (ii) shall include in such
document or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent.

of the Company Shareholders Meeting or to solicit additional proxies and votes
in favor of adoption of this Agreement if sufficient votes to constitute the
Company Shareholder Approval have not been obtained, but only to the extent
necessary to obtain such quorum or such sufficient votes and the Company uses
its reasonable best efforts to obtain such a quorum or such sufficient votes
as promptly as reasonably practicable or (iii) or to the extent (and only to
the extent) required by Applicable Law. In no event shall all such
adjournments, recesses or postponements, together with all postponements made
pursuant to Section 6.01(d), exceed fourteen (14) days in the aggregate,
except as required to comply with Applicable Law or the provisions of the
Company Organizational Documents; _provided_ that, at any time that an
Acquisition Proposal is pending, any such adjournments, recesses or
postponements, together with all postponements made pursuant to Section

avoidance of doubt, measured from the time that the Acquisition Proposal is
received by the Company). The Company shall provide updates to Parent with
respect to the proxy solicitation for the Company Shareholders Meeting
(including interim results) as reasonably requested by Parent.

required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
Statement, Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such event or change,
and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC
of any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement and, as
required by Applicable Law, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to the Companys shareholders. Nothing in this
Section 6.01(c) shall limit the obligations of any party under Section
6.01(a).

 

(d) The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms prior thereto, its obligations to hold the Company
Shareholders Meeting pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall not be affected by
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal or by the making of any Adverse
Recommendation Change by the Company Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
subject to Section 6.01(b), if the public announcement of an Adverse
Recommendation Change or the delivery of notice by the Company Parent
pursuant to Section 5.02(d)(i) occurs less than seven (7) Business Days prior
to the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall be entitled to postpone
the Company Shareholders Meeting to a date not more than seven (7) Business
Days after the later of such event and the original date of the Company
Shareholders Meeting.

Applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, afford Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable access, upon
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours, during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all their respective properties, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to
the Parent (a) to the extent not publicly

 



39  available, a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of

material respect with the normal business operations of the Company its
Subsidiaries); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required
to permit such access or make such disclosure, to the extent that such
disclosure or access would reasonably be likely to (i) violate the terms of
any confidentiality agreement or other Contract with a third party (
_provided_ that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the required consent of such third party to such disclosure or access), (ii)
result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ that the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or
disclosure (or as much of it as possible) in a manner that would not be

violate any Applicable Law. If any material is withheld by the Company
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall, to the
extent possible without violating an agreement or Applicable Law or risking
a loss of attorney-client privilege, inform Parent as to the general nature
of what is being withheld. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to provide any
access or make any disclosure to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.02 to the
extent such access or information is reasonably pertinent to a litigation

as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material to be provided to the Parent under this Section 6.02 as

therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors
of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the

such consolidation, amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable, shall cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Company, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.04.

(d) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall either cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies for the Company and its current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company in
either case, of not less than the existing coverage and having other terms
not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently
maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time (with insurance carriers having
at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance); _provided_ that in no
event shall Parent be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in
excess of 300% of the aggregate annual premium payable by the Company for such
insurance policy for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 (the " _Maximum
Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if such insurance can only be
obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Amount, Parent shall
obtain the most advantageous policy of directors and officers insurance

 



43  obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of
such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may, if it has received
the prior written consent of Parent, purchase a "tail" directors and
officers liability insurance policy and fiduciary liability insurance policy
for the Company and its current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, such tail to provide
coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other
terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time. In the event
the Company purchases such tail coverage, the Surviving Company shall cease
to have any obligations under the first sentence of this Section 6.04(d). The
Surviving Company shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee the prompt
payment of the obligations of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
under this Section 6.04.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.04(f) (i) shall survive consummation
of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and
(iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

 

Section 6.05. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company and Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to

each individual who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, or who will
become subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act as of the Effective Time, to
be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.06. _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company
shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

prior to such consultation, except as may be required by Applicable Law, court
process or the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply to any release or other public statement to the
extent containing information that is consistent with the joint press release
referred to below or any other release or public statement previously issued
or made in accordance with this Section 6.06; _provided_ , _further_ , that
the Company need not consult Parent in connection with the matters referred to
in and in accordance with Section 5.02, including any press release or public
statement to be issued or made in order to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change made pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5.02, and Parent need
not consult the Company in connection with any matters referred to in Section
5.02. The parties hereto agree that the initial

 



44  press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby following execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release in
the form heretofore agreed to by Parent and the Company. Except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement (including the first sentence of this Section)
or as required by Applicable Law, no party shall issue any press release or
make any public statement regarding the other party or the other partys
operations, directors, officers or employees without obtaining the other
partys prior written consent.

 

Section 6.07. _Employee Matters_.

Agreement, whose compensation and benefits shall be provided in accordance
with any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement) who remains in the
employment of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries during such period (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") with at least the same salary, wages,

incentive compensation and bonus opportunities provided to such Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date (other than equity
compensation) and employee benefits (other than equity compensation and
defined benefit pension benefits) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such Continuing Employee under

any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the requirements of Applicable Law shall
be provided by Parent and its Subsidiaries pursuant to Applicable Law.

 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, credit each
Continuing Employee for service earned on and prior to the Effective Time
with the Company and its Affiliates, or any of their respective predecessors,
in addition to service earned with Parent and its Subsidiaries on or after the
Closing Date, (i) to the extent that service is relevant for purposes of
eligibility, vesting or the calculation of vacation, sick days, severance,
layoff and/or similar benefits (but not for purposes of defined benefit
pension benefit accruals) under any employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate on or after the Closing Date (other than
any such plan that as of immediately prior to the Closing Date is frozen to
new participants) and (ii) for such additional purposes as may be required by
Applicable Law, in each case, if an analogous Company Benefit Plan was in
effect as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, to the extent such service
would have been recognized by the Company or its applicable Subsidiary under
such analogous Company Benefit Plan as of immediately prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ that nothing herein shall result in a duplication of benefits
with respect to Continuing Employees.

 

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive limitations on benefits relating to any pre-
existing conditions of Continuing Employees and their eligible spouses and
dependents. Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, recognize for

plans applicable to Continuing Employees, deductible and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by Continuing Employees and their respective spouses and
dependents the Companys or any of its Affiliates health plans in the
calendar year in which the applicable Effective Time occurs.

the provisions of this Section 6.07 are for the sole benefit of the parties
to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or
shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Continuing Employee or other current or former
employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates), other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies (including with respect to the matters
provided for in this Section 6.07) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 6.07 shall constitute or be deemed to
constitute the establishment, adoption or amendment of any Company Benefit
Plan or any other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to
continue to employ or retain the services of any Continuing Employee or any
other employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates for any period of time
following the Closing.

 

Section 6.08. _Merger Sub; Parent Subsidiaries; Company Subsidiaries_.

Parent to comply with and perform all of its obligations under or relating to
this Agreement, including in the case of Merger Sub to consummate the Merger

cooperation to the extent it would require the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Representatives to waive or
amend any terms of this Agreement, incur any actual or potential liabilities
(of any kind), pay any fees, reimburse any expenses, or provide any indemnity,
or enter into any definitive agreement, in each case prior to the Closing for

Agreement or any such document (other than the Statutory Merger Agreement,

Agreement, including in the case of the Company, the right to specific
performance and injunctive relief to cause Parent and Merger Sub to effect the

which any party may have under this Agreement or otherwise. Each of the
parties hereto expressly disclaims that it is owed any duties not expressly
set forth in this Agreement, and waives and releases any and all tort claims
and causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement.
