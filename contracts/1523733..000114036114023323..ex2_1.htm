(subject to an aggregate $50,000,000 cap as to all Sponsors).   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound,
the Parties agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

 _THE MERGER; THE GP EQUITY TRANSFER_

  

  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DRULPA and the DLLCA, at
the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into MLP (the "
_Merger_ "), the separate limited liability company existence of Merger Sub
will cease, and MLP will continue its existence as a limited partnership under
the Laws of the State of Delaware as the surviving entity in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Entity_ ").

  

  

Section 1.2 _The GP Equity Transfer_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DLLCA, at
the Effective Time, GP Holdings will transfer and deliver to Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent designated by Parent, and Parent (or its designated
Affiliate) will accept the transfer and delivery from GP Holdings of, the GP
Equity Interest, free and clear of all Liens, except for any transfer
restrictions under any applicable securities Laws (the " _GP Equity Transfer_
").

  

  

Section 1.3 _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of _Article VII_ , unless
otherwise agreed by Parent and MLP in writing, the closing of the Transactions
(the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Jones Day, 2727 North
Harwood Street, Dallas, Texas 75201 at 7:30 A.M., local time, on the second
Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions); provided, however, that (a) if the Closing would otherwise occur
within the 10 Business Day period prior to the date on which MLP's Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q or MLP's Annual Report on Form 10-K (or any amendment to
any previously filed MLP SEC Document) would be required to be filed with the
SEC, the Closing will occur on the third Business Day after the filing by MLP
of such report (subject, in each case, to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions as of the date determined by this _clause (a)_ ) and (b) if the
Closing would otherwise occur during the Unitholder Consent Period, the
Closing will occur on the first Business Day following the expiration of such
period (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions as of the
date determined by this _clause (b)_ ). The date on which the Closing actually
occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

  

  

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, MLP will cause a certificate of merger, executed in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DRULPA and the DLLCA (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "), to be duly filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware. The Merger will become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later date or time as may be agreed by MLP and
Parent in writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the effective
time of the Merger (as well as the GP Equity Transfer) is referred to as the "
_Effective Time_ "). If the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
requires any changes in the Certificate of Merger as a condition to filing or
issuing a certificate that the Merger is effective, the Parties shall execute
any necessary revisions incorporating such changes; provided that such changes
are not inconsistent with and do not result in any material changes in the
terms of this Agreement.

  

    

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity_. At the
Effective Time:

  

  

(a) _Certificate of Limited Partnership_. The certificate of limited
partnership of MLP as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will
remain unchanged and will be the certificate of limited partnership of the
Surviving Entity from and after the Effective Time, and thereafter may be
amended as provided therein or by Law.

  

  

(b) _MLP Partnership Agreement_. The MLP Partnership Agreement as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time will remain unchanged (except as
otherwise provided by this Agreement) and will be the partnership agreement of
the Surviving Entity from and after the Effective Time, and thereafter may be
amended as provided therein or by Law.

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

 _EFFECT ON UNITS; TRANSFER OF GP EQUITY INTEREST_

  

  

Section 2.1 _Effect of Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the MLP Entities, the Parent Entities or
the holder of any securities of any of them:

  

  

(a) _Conversion of Common Units Owned by Public Unitholders_. Each issued and
outstanding Common Unit that is owned by the Public Unitholders as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will (i) be converted into the right
to receive the Public Merger Related Consideration, (ii) no longer be
outstanding, (iii) automatically be cancelled and (iv) cease to exist.

  

  

(b) _Conversion of Common Units Owned by Sponsors and Founding Unitholders_.
Each issued and outstanding Common Unit that is owned by the Sponsors or the
Founding Unitholders as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will (i) be
converted into the right to receive the Sponsor Merger Related Consideration,
(ii) no longer be outstanding, (iii) automatically be cancelled and (iv) cease
to exist.

  

  

(c) _Limited Partner Interests of the Surviving Entity_. The membership
interests in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into 100% of the limited partner interests in
MLP (as the Surviving Entity). At the Effective Time, the books and records of
the Surviving Entity will be revised to reflect the admission of each member
of Merger Sub as a Limited Partner of the Surviving Entity (with each such
member having a proportionate share of the aggregate Limited Partner Interests
in the Surviving Entity equal to such member's proportionate share of the
aggregate membership interests in Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time) and the simultaneous withdrawal of
all other Limited Partners of MLP (as the Surviving Entity).

  

    

(d) _Cancellation of MLP-Owned Units and Parent-Owned Units_. Any Partnership
Interests that are owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by MLP or any
Subsidiary of MLP, and any Partnership Interests owned immediately prior to
the Effective Time by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent will be automatically
cancelled and will cease to exist. No consideration will be delivered in
exchange for such cancelled Partnership Interests.

  

  

(e) _General Partner Interest Unaffected_. The General Partner Interest issued
and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
unaffected by the Merger and will remain outstanding; provided however, that,
upon the GP Equity Transfer, the General Partner Interest will be owned,
directly or indirectly, by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated by
Parent.

  

  

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Book-Entry Units_.

  

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a
paying agent reasonably acceptable to MLP (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
purpose of exchanging Common Units held of record in book-entry form (" _Book-
Entry Units_ ") for the Merger Related Consideration. Subject to _Section
2.2(c)_ , as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in
no event more than three Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent
will send, or will cause the Paying Agent to send, to each holder of Book-
Entry Units (other than The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ")) as of the
Effective Time (and, to the extent commercially practicable, Parent will, or
will cause the Paying Agent to, make available for collection by hand, during
customary business hours commencing immediately after the Effective Time, if
so elected by a holder of Book-Entry Units), a letter of transmittal in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (each such letter, a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") to be used for surrender of Book-Entry Units pursuant to this
_Article II_.

  

  

(b) _Deposit_. At or prior to the Closing, (i) Parent will deposit or cause to
be deposited with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Unitholders, an
amount of cash in U.S. dollars equal to the sum of the aggregate Public Merger
Consideration to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ plus the aggregate
Sponsor Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ and (ii)
MLP will deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Unitholders, an
amount of cash in U.S. dollars equal to the aggregate Merger Related
Distribution to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Section 2.1(b)_ , in
each case, payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry Units pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_. All cash deposited with the Paying Agent is
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Paying Agent will, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Related Consideration
contemplated to be paid pursuant to this _Article II_ out of the Exchange
Fund. The Paying Agent will invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;
provided that (x) no such investment or losses thereon will affect the Merger
Related Consideration payable to Unitholders entitled to receive such Merger
Related Consideration and Parent will promptly cause to be provided additional
funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of Unitholders entitled to receive
such Merger Related Consideration in the amount of any such losses and (y)
such investments will be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United
States of America or rated A-l or P-l or better by Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investment will be the sole and exclusive property
of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated by Parent, and no part of such
earnings will accrue to the benefit of Unitholders.

  

    

(c) _Exchange_.

  

  

(i) Each holder of Book-Entry Units other than DTC, upon surrender thereof by
delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance
with the terms of such Letter of Transmittal, will be entitled to receive in
exchange for each surrendered Book-Entry Unit a cash amount equal to the
Merger Related Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_ ). DTC, upon surrender of its Book-
Entry Units in accordance with the customary surrender procedures of DTC and
the Paying Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange for each surrendered
Book-Entry Unit a cash amount equal to the Merger Related Consideration. Each
Book-Entry Unit surrendered pursuant to this _Section 2.2(c)_ will be
cancelled.

  

  

(ii) The Merger Related Consideration will be paid to (A) the holders of Book-
Entry Units other than DTC, as promptly as practicable after receipt by the
Paying Agent of the Letter of Transmittal in respect thereof, by mail or wire
transfer of immediately available funds and (B) DTC, as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

  

  

(iii) Payment of the Merger Related Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Units will only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Units are
registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of Book-Entry Units. Until surrendered and paid as contemplated
hereby, each Book-Entry Unit will be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Related Consideration
in cash as contemplated by this Agreement. The Merger Related Consideration
paid upon surrender of such Book-Entry Units will be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Book-Entry Units.

  

  

(iv) No Person beneficially owning Common Units through DTC will be required
to deliver a Letter of Transmittal to receive the Merger Related Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive through DTC. Any such Person will
receive its Merger Related Consideration in accordance with the customary
payment procedures of DTC following the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there will be
no further registration on the books of MLP of transfers of Common Units. From
and after the Effective Time, the Unitholders as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to such Common
Units, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

  

    

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Unitholders on the first anniversary of the Effective
Time will be returned to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated by
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged its Common
Units for the Merger Related Consideration in accordance with this _Section
2.2_ prior to that time will thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of
the Merger Related Consideration in respect of such holder's Common Units. Any
Merger Related Consideration remaining unclaimed by Unitholders immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Authority will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent
designated by Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Merger Sub, MLP, MLP GP or any of their respective Affiliates will be liable
to any Unitholder for any Merger Related Consideration duly delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws.

  

  

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Phantom Units_.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, each Phantom Unit that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall (i) be canceled
and converted into the right to receive from Parent (through MLP GP) the
Phantom Unit Consideration, (ii) no longer be outstanding and (iii) cease to
exist. As a condition to the receipt of the Phantom Unit Consideration, each
holder of Phantom Units will be required to execute and deliver to MLP GP an
acknowledgement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ (a " _Phantom
Unitholder Acknowledgement_ ").

  

  

(b) Parent will cause MLP GP to pay the Phantom Unit Consideration (i) to any
holder of Phantom Units who executes and delivers to MLP GP a Phantom
Unitholder Acknowledgement at the Closing, as promptly as practicable (but in
no event later than three Business Days) following the Closing Date and (ii)
to any holder of Phantom Units who executes and delivers to MLP GP a Phantom
Unitholder Acknowledgement after the Closing, as promptly as practicable (but
in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll date that occurs
at least three Business Days) following the delivery of such Phantom
Unitholder Acknowledgement. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Phantom
Unit Consideration. The Phantom Unit Consideration paid will be paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Phantom Units formerly
outstanding.

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, MLP and MLP GP, including the MLP GP Board
and any committee thereof, shall take all action necessary under the MLP
Equity Plans to permit and effect the cancellation and conversion of Phantom
Units as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_.

  

  

  

Section 2.4 _Distributions_.

  

  

(a) The MLP Entities, including the MLP GP Board and any applicable committee
thereof, have adopted and approved the incorporation of _Annex VI_ of the MLP
Disclosure Letter into MLP's distribution policy. The MLP Entities shall not
take any action, including any amendment or modification of MLP's distribution
policy, that prohibits or restricts, or limits the ability of, either MLP
Entity from complying with the terms and conditions of _Annex VI_ of the MLP
Disclosure Letter in connection with any distribution permitted under _Section
6.3(d)_ , including the determination and payment of the Merger Related
Distribution.

  

    

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the MLP Entities
and GP Holdings will declare and make any distribution permitted under
_Section 6.3(d)_ , including the determination and payment of the Merger
Related Distribution, in accordance with and subject to the limitations of
_Annex VI_ of the MLP Disclosure Letter.

  

  

Section 2.5 _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, MLP, MLP GP, Merger Sub, any
Affiliate of Parent that has been designated by Parent pursuant to this
_Article II_ and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement, including to a
Unitholder or a holder of Phantom Units, such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law. The MLP Entities shall cooperate with Parent
in coordinating the deduction and withholding of any Taxes required to be
deducted and withheld by any MLP Group Entity under applicable Tax Law,
including payroll Taxes relating to payments made in respect of Phantom Units.
To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax
authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for the purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person, including the former Unitholder
or former holder of Phantom Units, as applicable, in respect of whom such
withholding was made.

  

  

Section 2.6 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article II_
to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in _Section
6.2_ and _6.3_ or other applicable prohibitions in this Agreement), if between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number of outstanding
Common Units have been changed into a different number of units or a different
class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any unit dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up, unit
distribution, combination, exchange of units or similar transaction, the
Merger Related Consideration will be equitably adjusted to proportionately
reflect the effect of such unit dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, split-up, unit distribution, combination, exchange of
units or similar transaction and to provide the Unitholders and holders of
Phantom Units the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event.

  

  

Section 2.7 _No Dissenters ' Rights_. No dissenters' or appraisal rights are
or will be available with respect to the Transactions.

  

  

Section 2.8 _GP Equity Transfer Covenants_. At the Effective Time, (a) GP
Holdings and Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated by Parent will each
execute and deliver to one another the Transfer Agreement substantially in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , (b) MLP GP will (i) register the GP
Equity Transfer in its books and records and (ii) update its records to
reflect Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated by Parent (as applicable)
as the registered owner of the GP Equity Interest and (c) GP Holdings will
deliver to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated by Parent the
resignations of such managers, officers and directors of MLP GP as are
requested by Parent prior to the Closing Date.

  

    

ARTICLE III

  

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE MLP ENTITIES_

  

  

Except as disclosed in (a) the MLP SEC Documents filed with the SEC on or
after December 31, 2013 and publicly available at least 24 hours prior to the

disclosures in any section relating to forward-looking statements and any
other disclosures included therein to the extent they are primarily predictive
or forward-looking in nature) or (b) the corresponding sections of the
disclosure letter delivered by MLP to Parent (the " _MLP Disclosure Letter_ ")
prior to the execution of this Agreement (or disclosed in any other section,
subsection or clause of the MLP Disclosure Letter if it is reasonably apparent
from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure will be deemed to be
disclosed with respect to any other section, subsection or clause of this
Agreement), MLP and MLP GP jointly and severally represent and warrant to

Section 3.1 _Organization_.

  

  

(a) Each of MLP and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly formed or
organized (as applicable), validly existing and in good standing under the

applicable. Each of MLP and its Subsidiaries has all requisite partnership,
corporate, limited liability company or other applicable power and authority
necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as currently conducted, except where the failure to have such power
or authority would not, and would not reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, result in any material liability to the MLP Group
Entities or otherwise interfere in any material respect with the conduct of
their respective businesses as currently conducted.

  

  

(b) Each of MLP and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
that concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(c) MLP has made available to Parent true and complete copies of its
certificate of limited partnership and the MLP Partnership Agreement (the "
_MLP Charter Documents_ "), and true and complete copies of the comparable
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries and MLP GP, in each case

Phantom Unit outstanding as of the date hereof, (i) the number of Common Units
issuable thereunder, (ii) the grant date, (iii) the vesting schedule, (iv) the
amount vested and outstanding and (v) the MLP Equity Plan pursuant to which
the award was made. No outstanding Partnership Interests are subject to
vesting restrictions or other risk of forfeiture to MLP under the MLP Equity
Plans or otherwise. All Phantom Units are evidenced by award agreements, in
each case, in the form made available to Parent. Each such Phantom Unit award
agreement provides that the MLP LTIP controls in the event of any conflict and
no such agreement contains any terms that are materially different from such
forms. Each Phantom Unit may be treated, by its terms, as set forth in
_Section 2.3_. From the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement,
neither MLP nor its Subsidiaries have issued any Equity Securities.

  

  

(c) Except for this Agreement, the MLP Partnership Agreement, the Registration

registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable foreign and
state securities Laws, or if such Equity Securities were not so registered or
exempt, any private rights of action for rescission or damages arising from
the failure to register any such Equity Securities are time barred by
applicable statutes of limitations or equitable principles, including laches.

  

  

(d) PetroLogistics Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Finance Corp._
"), and PL Propylene LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _OpCo_ "),
are the only Subsidiaries of MLP. All the outstanding Equity Interests of each
Subsidiary of MLP have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully

Finance Corp. and OpCo, MLP and its Subsidiaries do not directly or
indirectly, beneficially or of record, own any Equity Securities of any other
Person, or have any obligations or have made any Contract to acquire any
Equity Securities of, or to make any investment (in the form of a loan,

legal, valid and binding obligation of each of the MLP Entities, enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to
general equity principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

  

  

(b) MLP GP, in its capacity as the general partner of MLP has consented to the
Merger and approved this Agreement, and the written consent of the holders of
a Unit Majority approving this Agreement and the Transactions (the " _MLP
Unitholder Consent_ ") is the only vote or approval of the holders of any

Entities and GP Holdings of the Transactions, except for any such Consents

expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in an MLP Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 3.6 _MLP SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

  

  

(a) Since May 3, 2012, all MLP SEC Documents (except for the Information
Statement, which is addressed in _Section 6.1(b)_ ) have been timely filed or
furnished to the SEC in accordance with the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. All MLP SEC Documents (i) complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the
NYSE and (ii) as of its filing date in the case of any Exchange Act report and
as of its effective date in the case of any Securities Act filing, or if
amended, supplemented or superseded, as finally amended, supplemented or
superseded prior to the date of this Agreement, did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. MLP has
made available to Parent true and complete copies of all material
correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and any MLP Group Entity, on
the other hand, occurring since May 3, 2012. There are no outstanding or
unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to the MLP SEC
Documents. To the Knowledge of the MLP, no MLP SEC Document is the subject of
ongoing SEC review or investigation. None of MLP's Subsidiaries or MLP GP is
required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.

  

    

(b) The historical consolidated financial statements of MLP included in the
MLP SEC Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of
the last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of MLP and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and changes in partners' capital for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to
normal and immaterial year-end audit adjustments).

  

  

(c) MLP has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
MLP and its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by MLP in the
MLP SEC Documents under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
the MLP's principal executive officers and its principal financial officer
(the " _Principal Officers_ ") to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by MLP in the MLP SEC Documents
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. The Principal Officers have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to MLP's auditors and the
audit committee of the MLP GP Board (i) all significant deficiencies in the
design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect MLP's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
identified for MLP's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in MLP's internal controls. The
Principal Officers have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and the Exchange Act with respect to the MLP SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications were complete and correct when
made. The management of the MLP has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of MLP's internal control over financial reporting in compliance
with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act for the year
ended December 31, 2013, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. To the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, as of the date of this
Agreement there are no facts or circumstances that would prevent the Principal
Officers from giving the certifications and attestations required pursuant to
the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes
Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due. MLP is in compliance in all
material respects with all effective provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and,
to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, no employee of the MLP Group Entities
has provided or is providing information to any law enforcement agency
regarding the commission or possible commission of any crime or the violation
or possible violation of any applicable legal requirements of the type
described in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by any MLP Group Entity. No
MLP Group Entity nor, to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, any of their
respective Representatives has received any substantive complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, that an MLP Group Entity has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. No current or former
attorney representing any MLP Group Entity has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
the MLP Group Entities or any of their respective managers, officers,
directors, employees or agents, to the current MLP GP Board or any committee
thereof or to any current manager, director or executive officer of the MLP
Entities.

  

    

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Sections 3.6(a)_ through _3.6(c)_ ,

accountant of MLP as a result of or in connection with any disagreement with
MLP on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, (ii) no executive officer of MLP
has failed in any respect to make, without qualification, the certifications
required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with
respect to any form, report or schedule filed by MLP with the SEC since May 3,
2012 and (iii) no enforcement action has been initiated or, to the Knowledge
of the MLP Entities, threatened in writing against MLP by the SEC relating to
disclosures contained in any MLP SEC Document.

  

  

(e) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of MLP and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 (the "
_Balance Sheet Date_ ") (including the notes thereto) included in the MLP SEC
Documents filed by MLP and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance
Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business which have been paid, or are not
yet due and payable or are being contested in good faith, in each case for
which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP and
(iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in accordance with
this Agreement or in connection with the Transactions, neither MLP nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or
not accrued or contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved
against on a consolidated balance sheet of MLP prepared in accordance with
GAAP or the notes thereto in order for such balance sheet to fairly and
completely present MLP's financial position in all material respects.

  

  

(f) Neither MLP nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any Contract
to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among MLP and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
of the SEC)), where the purpose of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, MLP in MLP's
published financial statements or any MLP SEC Documents.

  

  

Section 3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

  

  

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date, there have not been any changes, events,
effects, occurrences, states of facts or developments that, individually or in
the aggregate with all other changes, events, effects, occurrences, states of
facts or developments, have had or would reasonably be expected to have an MLP
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) From the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, (i) except
for this Agreement and the Transactions, the MLP Group Entities have carried
on and operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) no MLP
Group Entity has taken any action that, if taken after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time without the prior written consent of
Parent, would constitute a breach of _Sections 6.3(a)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(h)_
, _(i)_ , _(l)_ , _(m)_ , _(n)_ or _(o)_.

  

    

Section 3.8 _Legal Proceedings_. No Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge
of the MLP Entities, is threatened, against or affecting any MLP Group Entity
or their respective assets (including by virtue of indemnification or
otherwise), or any director, manager, officer or employee (in his or her
capacity as such) of any MLP Group Entity that (a) would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in material liability to the
MLP Group Entities or otherwise interfere in any material respect with the
conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted or (b) as of the
date of this Agreement, challenges the validity or propriety of any of the
Transactions or otherwise seeks to prevent or materially delay consummation of
any of the Transactions or performance by the MLP Entities or GP Holdings of
any of their respective material obligations under this Agreement. None of the
MLP Group Entities is a party to, and none of the MLP Group Entities or their
respective assets are subject to the provisions of, any Orders of, or
promulgated or issued by or with (or settlement or consent Contract subject
to), any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, (i)
has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result, in material liability
to the MLP Group Entities or otherwise interfere in any material respect with
the conduct of their respective businesses as currently conducted or (ii)
challenges the validity or propriety of the Transactions or otherwise seeks to
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or performance by
the MLP Entities or GP Holdings of any of their respective material
obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

Section 3.9 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

  

  

(a) _Compliance with Laws_. None of the MLP Group Entities has been, or is, in
conflict with, default under or in violation of any Law (other than
Environmental Laws which are addressed in _Section 3.16_ ) applicable to any
MLP Group Entity or by which any property or asset of the MLP Group Entities
is bound or affected, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to
result in material liability to the MLP Group Entities or otherwise interfere
in any material respect with the conduct of their respective businesses as
currently conducted. Since March 31, 2009, no written notice, written charge,
written allegation or written assertion has been received by the MLP Group
Entities or, to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, threatened against any MLP
Group Entity alleging any actual or potential violation of or non-compliance
with any of the foregoing.

  

  

(b) _Permits_. The MLP Group Entities are in possession of Permits necessary
for the MLP Group Entities to own, lease and operate their properties and
assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted, except
where the failure to be in possession of such Permits would not, and would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in any
material liability to the MLP Group Entities or otherwise interfere in any
material respect with the conduct of their respective businesses as currently
conducted. All such Permits are in full force and effect, except where the
failure to be in full force and effect would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect. The MLP Group Entities are not, and
since March 31, 2009 have not been, in violation or breach of, or default
under, any such Permit, except where such violation, breach or default would
not have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension, modification, revocation or cancellation of any of such Permits is
pending or, to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, threatened, nor, to the
Knowledge of the MLP Entities, do reasonable grounds exist for any such
action, except for any such suspension, modification, revocation or

liability to any MLP Group Entity or otherwise interfere in any material
respect with the conduct of their respective businesses as currently

fine, or other criminal liability with respect to the MLP Group Entities or

(g) The consummation of the Transactions will not, either alone or in

entitle any current or former employee, individual, consultant or officer of
an MLP Group Entity to any severance pay, retention bonuses or any similar
payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of any compensation due any such employee, individual, consultant or
officer or (iii) result in any forgiveness of indebtedness or obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any such employee, individual, consultant or
officer. No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of any of the Transactions by any employee,
manager, officer or director of any MLP Group Entity or any of its Affiliates
who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or termination
Contract, other compensation Contract or MLP Benefit Plan currently in effect
would be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code), except as would not individually
or in the aggregate result in material liability to the MLP Group Entities or
otherwise interfere in any material respect with the conduct of their
respective businesses as currently conducted. No manager, director, officer,
employee or other service provider of any MLP Group Entity is entitled to a

compliance with Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2005, and all
applicable regulations and notices issued thereunder and (ii) since January 1,
2009, has been in documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code, except

Effect.

4980B of the Code, each MLP Entity and each ERISA Affiliate has complied with
the continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6
of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, except as would not reasonably be expected
to result in an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

benefit fund" as defined in Section 419(e) of the Code, and no benefits under
any MLP Benefit Plan are or at any time have been provided through a voluntary
employees' beneficiary association (within the meaning of subsection 501(c)(9)
of the Code) or a supplemental unemployment benefit plan (within the meaning
of Section 501(c)(17) of the Code).

Agreement has been, in compliance with all applicable Laws in respect of
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages
and hours and occupational safety and health (including classifications of
service providers as employees and/or independent contractors), except for any

otherwise interfere in any material respect with the conduct of their
respective businesses as currently conducted.

ARTICLE VI

  

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS_

  

  

Section 6.1 _Written Consent; Preparation of the Information Statement_.

  

  

(a) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Parties, MLP will, in accordance with the DRULPA, take all action necessary to
seek to obtain the MLP Unitholder Consent in the form attached as _Exhibit A_
hereto. As soon as practicable after receipt of the duly obtained MLP
Unitholder Consent, MLP GP will provide Parent with a facsimile or electronic
(.pdf) copy of such MLP Unitholder Consent, certified as true and complete by
an executive officer of MLP GP. If such MLP Unitholder Consent is not
delivered to MLP and Parent within 24 hours after the execution of this
Agreement, Parent will have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth
in _Section 8.1_. The MLP Entities will take all actions necessary to seek and
obtain the MLP Unitholder Consent in compliance with the DRULPA and the MLP
Partnership Agreement.

  

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than 15 Business Days)
following the date of this Agreement, MLP will, with the assistance of Parent,
prepare and file with the SEC an information statement of the type
contemplated by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act related to the
Transactions and this Agreement (such information statement, including any
amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Information Statement_ "). Parent and
MLP will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Information
Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent will
furnish to MLP the information relating to it and Merger Sub required by the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set
forth in the Information Statement. MLP will use its reasonable best efforts
to resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Information Statement as
promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof and to have the
Information Statement cleared by the staff of the SEC as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such filing. Each of Parent and MLP agrees to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Information Statement
which becomes false or misleading. MLP will as soon as reasonably practicable
notify Parent of receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to the
Information Statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment to the
Information Statement or for additional information and will provide Parent
with copies of all such comments and correspondence. Prior to filing or
mailing the Information Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect
thereto, MLP will provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to
propose comments on such document or response. Promptly after MLP has resolved
all comments to the Information Statement to the satisfaction of the SEC staff
or after 10 calendar days have passed since the date of filing of the
preliminary Information Statement with the SEC without notice from the SEC of
its intent to review the Information Statement, MLP will promptly file with
the SEC the Information Statement in definitive form as contemplated by Rule
14c-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act substantially in the form previously
cleared or filed with the SEC, as the case may be, and cause a copy of the
Information Statement to be mailed to each Unitholder. MLP will not
incorporate information by reference in the Information Statement in such a
manner that causes the earliest date that the Transactions may be consummated
after the Information Statement is mailed to the Unitholders to be 20 business
days after such mailing rather than 20 calendar days after such mailing.

  

    

Section 6.2 _Ordinary Course of Business_. From the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each of the MLP Entities will and the MLP Entities
and GP Holdings will cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to (a)

(i) Except as set forth in _Sections 6.4(a)(ii)_ and _6.4(a)(iii)_ , the MLP
Entities and GP Holdings agree that neither they nor any of their
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers, managers or directors
(including the MLP GP Board) shall, and that they shall instruct and cause
their respective Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, the " _MLP Non-
Solicit Parties_ ") not to, directly or indirectly:

  

  

(A) initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiries,
discussions regarding, or the making or submission of, any proposal, request
or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Alternative Proposal;

  

  

(B) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into any Contract or agreement in
principle, whether written or oral, with any Person (other than Parent and

(C) terminate, amend, release, modify, or fail to enforce any provision of, or
grant any permission, waiver or request under, any standstill, confidentiality
or similar Contract entered into by one or more of the MLP Group Entities in

extent the MLP GP Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its

Unitholders);

  

  

(D) conduct, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding any Alternative Proposal;

  

  

(E) furnish any non-public information relating to any of the MLP Group

(F) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Laws inapplicable
to any transactions contemplated by any Alternative Proposal; or

  

  

(G) resolve or publicly propose or announce to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
the conditions in _Section 6.4(a)(iii)_ and solely in response to a Bona Fide
Alternative Proposal made on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the expiration of the Unitholder Consent Period, the MLP Non-Solicit Parties
may, with respect to the Person that has made such Bona Fide Alternative
Proposal:

  

  

(A) in response to a request therefor by such Person, provide information or
afford access to the books and records or Representatives of any of the MLP
Group Entities; and

  

  

(B) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person
(and its Representatives) with respect to such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal.

  

  

(iii) The MLP Entities may not take the actions described in _Section
6.4(a)(ii)_ unless, prior to taking any such action:

  

    

(A) the MLP Entities have (1) received from such Person an executed
confidentiality and standstill agreement on terms that are no less restrictive
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (and compliant with the
last sentence of _Section 6.4(g)_ ) and (2) disclosed to Parent (and, if
applicable, contemporaneously provided copies of) any non-public information
to be provided to such Person and any books or records to which such Person
will be afforded access, in each case, to the extent not previously provided
to Parent;

  

  

(B) the MLP Entities have delivered to Parent written notice prior to taking
any such action (1) stating that the MLP GP Board intends to take such action,
(2) stating that the MLP GP Board has made the determination set forth in
_Section 6.4(a)(iii)(C)_ and (3) including an unredacted copy of such Bona
Fide Alternative Proposal (including any materials relating to such Person's
proposed equity and debt financing, if any) and an executed copy of the
confidentiality and standstill agreement described in _Section 6.4(a)(iii)(A)_
; and

  

  

(C) the MLP GP Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial and legal advisors that such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal.

  

  

(b) _No Withdrawal of Recommendation_. Except as set forth in _Section 6.4(c)_
, no MLP Non-Solicit Party shall:

  

  

(i) withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the Board Recommendation;

  

  

(ii) fail to announce publicly, within 10 Business Days after a tender offer
or exchange offer relating to any securities of MLP has been commenced, that
the MLP GP Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer;

  

  

(iii) fail to include the Board Recommendation in the Information Statement
distributed to the Unitholders in connection with the Transactions;

  

  

(iv) make any other public statement that is inconsistent with the Board
Recommendation;

  

  

(v) approve, adopt or recommend any Alternative Proposal; or

  

  

(vi) resolve or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any such
prohibited action described in _clause 6.4(b)(i)_ through this _clause
6.4(b)(vi)_ being referred to as a " _Withdrawal of Recommendation_ ");

  

  

provided that the making of any determination of the MLP GP Board (or any
committee thereof) to provide, or the provision of, a Superior Proposal Notice
or an Intervening Event Notice in compliance with the terms of this Agreement
shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a Withdrawal of Recommendation.

  

    

(c) _Certain Permitted Withdrawals of Recommendation_. Subject to _Section
6.4(d)_ , at any time prior to the end of the Unitholder Consent Period, the
MLP GP Board may effect, or cause the MLP Entities to effect, as the case may
be, a Withdrawal of Recommendation if: (i) the MLP GP Board determines that
(A) after complying with _Section 6.4(d)(i)_ , a Bona Fide Alternative
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) after complying with _Section
6.4(d)(ii)_ , an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the
MLP GP Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial and legal advisors, that the Transactions are not in the best
interests of the Unitholders.

  

  

(d) _Procedure Prior to Withdrawal of Recommendation_.

  

  

(i) _Superior Proposal_. The MLP GP Board shall be entitled to effect, or
cause the MLP Entities to effect, a Withdrawal of Recommendation in connection
with a Superior Proposal (to the extent permitted under _Section 6.4(c)_ ),
only if (A) the MLP Entities shall have delivered to Parent a written notice
(a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") (1) stating that the MLP GP Board intends
to take such actions pursuant to _Section 6.4(c)_, (2) stating that the MLP GP
Board has made the determinations set forth in _Sections 6.4(c)(i)(A)_ and
_6.4(c)(ii)_ and (3) including an unredacted copy of such Superior Proposal
and proposed and unredacted form of any Alternative Acquisition Agreement
related to such Superior Proposal (including any materials relating to such
Person's proposed equity and debt financing, if any) and (B) the Negotiation
Period shall have expired. During the four Business Day period commencing on
the date of Parent's receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice (such period, as
may be extended pursuant to this _Section 6.4(d)(i)_ , the " _Negotiation
Period_ "), the MLP Entities shall engage, and shall cause their
Representatives to be available for the purpose of engaging, in good faith
negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding
an amendment of this Agreement so that the Alternative Proposal that is the
subject of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Superior Proposal;
provided that, as is the case with any Superior Proposal, any such amendment
must reflect a transaction in which the value differential between the
consideration to be received by the Public Unitholders in such transaction and
the consideration to be received by the Sponsors and Founding Unitholders in
such transaction equals the Agreed Merger Consideration Differential. Each
time the financial or other material terms or conditions of such Bona Fide
Alternative Proposal (or terms or conditions related thereto, such as the
proposed equity and debt financing) are amended or modified, the MLP Entities
shall be required to deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice
(including, as attachments thereto, amended forms of the written Alternative
Acquisition Agreements relating to such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal) and
the Negotiation Period shall be extended by an additional two Business Days
from the date of Parent's receipt of such new Superior Proposal Notice.
Nothing set forth in this _Section 6.4(d)(i)_ shall extend or be deemed to
extend the Unitholder Consent Period.

  

    

(ii) _Intervening Event_. The MLP GP Board shall be entitled to effect, or
cause the MLP Entities to effect, a Withdrawal of Recommendation in connection
with, an Intervening Event (to the extent permitted under _Section 6.4(c)_ ),
only if (A) the MLP Entities shall have delivered to Parent prior to the
expiration of the Unitholder Consent Period a written notice (an "
_Intervening Event Notice_ ") (1) stating that the MLP GP Board intends to
take such actions pursuant to _Section 6.4(c)_ , (2) stating that the MLP GP
Board has made the determinations set forth in _Sections 6.4(c)(i)(B)_ and
_6.4(c)(ii)_ and (3) including a summary, in all material respects, of the
Intervening Event and (B) the Intervening Event Negotiation Period shall have
expired. During the four Business Day period commencing on the date of
Parent's receipt of such Intervening Event Notice (such period, as may be
extended pursuant to this _Section 6.4(d)(ii)_ , the " _Intervening Event
Negotiation Period_ "), the MLP Entities shall engage, and shall cause their
Representatives to be available for the purpose of engaging, in good faith
negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding
an amendment of this Agreement so that the MLP GP Board would no longer be
permitted to take such actions pursuant to _Section 6.4(c)_. Each time there
is a material change to the facts or circumstances relating to the Intervening
Event, the MLP Entities shall be required to deliver to Parent a new
Intervening Event Notice (including, as attachments thereto, a summary of the
changes to the facts and circumstances relating to the Intervening Event) and
the Intervening Event Negotiation Period shall be extended by an additional
two Business Days from the date of Parent's receipt of such new Intervening
Event Notice. Nothing set forth in this _Section 6.4(d)(ii)_ shall extend or
be deemed to extend the Unitholder Consent Period.

  

  

(iii) _MLP Partner Approvals_. In the event the Parties enter into an
amendment to this Agreement during the Negotiation Period or the Intervening
Event Negotiation Period (or any extensions of such periods) and if reasonably
requested in writing by Parent, (A) MLP GP will execute a written consent (1)
approving such amendment and (2) authorizing the approval of such amendment
and the transactions contemplated thereby by the Limited Partners by written
consent without a meeting, without a vote and without prior notice and (B) the
MLP Entities will promptly take all action necessary to seek to obtain the
written consent of the holders of a Unit Majority approving such amendment
substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ and in compliance with the DRULPA and
the MLP Partnership Agreement (such consents in _clauses (A)_ and _(B)_ , the
" _MLP Amendment Consents_ "). As soon as practicable after receipt of such
duly obtained MLP Amendment Consents, MLP GP will provide Parent with
facsimile or electronic (.pdf) copies of such written consents, certified as
true and complete by an executive officer of MLP GP.

  

  

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section_ _6.4_
shall be deemed to prohibit the MLP Entities from complying with their
required disclosure obligations under applicable Law with regard to an
Alternative Proposal or an Intervening Event; provided, however, that none of
MLP, MLP GP or the MLP GP Board (or any committee thereof) shall effect any
Withdrawal of Recommendation, except in accordance with _Section 6.4(c)_ and
_Section 6.4(d)_ ; and provided, further, that in no event shall any "Stop-
Look-and-Listen" communication contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act be deemed to be a Withdrawal of Recommendation or to violate this
_Section 6.4_. Disclosure of the type described in this _Section_ _6.4(e)_
(other than the type described in the second proviso of the foregoing
sentence) that is not an express rejection of any Alternative Proposal or an
express confirmation that the Board Recommendation remains in effect shall be
deemed to be a Withdrawal of Recommendation.

  

    

(f) _Existing Discussions_. The MLP Entities and GP Holdings shall, and shall
cause their Subsidiaries and their respective officers, managers and directors
and their respective Affiliates and Representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with, or any
solicitation or intentional assistance or encouragement of, any Person with
respect to any Alternative Proposal (or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to or result in an Alternative Proposal) which are on-going as of the
date of this Agreement and request that any such Person promptly return and
destroy (and confirm destruction of) all confidential information concerning
the MLP Group Entities. The MLP Entities and GP Holdings shall take the
necessary steps to promptly inform, on the date of this Agreement, the
individuals or entities referred to in the preceding sentence of this _Section
6.4(f)_.

  

  

(g) _Notice_. Without limiting anything in this _Section 6.4_ , the MLP
Entities shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent
orally and in writing if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an
Alternative Proposal or requests for non-public information relating to any of
the MLP Group Entities (other than requests for information in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and unrelated to an
Alternative Proposal) are received by, or any discussions or negotiations with
respect to an Alternative Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued
with, any of the MLP Group Entities or GP Holdings or any of their respective
Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of such discussions, proposals,
offers or requests, and including in the written version of such notice, an
unredacted copy of any written (including via electronic transmission)
proposals, offers or requests, in each case, including any amendments or
modifications thereto. The MLP Entities shall promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours after any amendment or modification of, or development with
respect to, any such, proposal, offer, request or Alternative Proposal, or at
the reasonable request of Parent) notify Parent orally and in writing of the
status of any such inquiries, proposals, offers or requests, including any
material developments, notifications, amendments or modifications thereto and
furnish to Parent copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft
documentation in connection with such discussions, proposals, offers or
requests. The MLP Entities and GP Holdings shall not, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, enter into any Contract
that would prohibit them from providing the information required to be
provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section_ _6.4(g)_.

  

    

Section 6.5 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations_.

  

  

(a) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Parent and the MLP Entities and GP Holdings will cooperate with each other and
use (and will cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable under this
Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Transactions as soon as practicable, including by (i) filing the Notification
and Report Forms pursuant to the HSR Act within 10 Business Days after the
date of this Agreement, (ii) using their respective reasonable best efforts
(including complying with its obligations under _Section 6.5(c)_ ) to obtain
as promptly as practicable all Antitrust Consents and Other Governmental
Consents, and the termination or expiration, as applicable, of approvals or
waiting periods required under all applicable Antitrust Laws in order to
consummate the Transactions and (iii) cooperating with each other in
connection with any review of, inquiry into, investigation of, or challenge to
the Transactions under any Antitrust Law by a Governmental Authority and all
activities with respect to any requests that may be made by, or any actions,
Consents or undertakings that may be sought by or from, any Governmental
Authority in respect of Antitrust Consents and Other Governmental Consents,
including determining the manner in which to contest or otherwise respond, by
litigation or otherwise, to objections to, or Proceedings challenging, the
consummation of the Transactions; provided that nothing in this Agreement will
require Parent, Merger Sub, any MLP Group Entity, GP Holdings or any of their
respective Affiliates to offer, accept or agree, or commit to agree, to, a
Divestiture Condition in order to obtain any Antitrust Consent or Other
Governmental Consent; and provided, further, that none of the MLP Entities or
GP Holdings will, without Parent's prior written consent, offer, accept or
agree, or commit to agree, to, any Divestiture Condition. Nothing in this
_Section 6.5_ will limit any applicable rights a Party may have to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ in a case where _Section 8.1_ permits
such termination. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Parties will
act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub will have the absolute
right (but not the obligation) to contest, at their cost and expense, any
challenge to this Agreement by any Governmental Authority, including
contesting through a Proceeding initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice or
the Federal Trade Commission to enjoin any of the Transactions, provided that
(i) such actions do not prevent the Closing from occurring on or before the
Outside Date and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub afford the MLP Entities, GP
Holdings and their respective Representatives an opportunity to participate in
all associated Proceedings, provided that Parent and Merger Sub will retain
final discretion and authority with respect to such litigation.

  


 

  

(b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Law, Parent and the MLP Entities and
GP Holdings each will, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers, members,
managers, general partners and stockholders and such other matters as may be
necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, any MLP Entity or GP Holdings to
any Governmental Authority or other Person in connection with the Parties'
respective obligations under _Section 6.5(a)_.

  

  

(c) _Fees and Other Costs of Governmental Consents_. Each of Parent and MLP
will be responsible for its own fees, costs and expenses, including costs and
expenses of any necessary experts or consultants, incurred by Parent or MLP,
as applicable, in connection with any review of, inquiry into, investigation
of, or challenge to any of the Transactions; provided that Parent will be
responsible for paying the filing fee under the HSR Act and any filing fee
associated with any other applicable Antitrust Laws.

  

    

(d) _Notification Requirements_. Each Party will promptly notify the other
Parties of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement; provided that such notice must be delivered within 24 hours if the
communication is a Divestiture Request. The Parties will coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing. The Parties will provide each other with copies of all filings
and all material correspondence or communications between them or any of their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of
its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions. The Parties will use reasonable best efforts to share
information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant
to this section so as to preserve any applicable privilege.

  

  

Section 6.6 _Public Announcements_. Parent and MLP will develop (a) the joint
press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement, including any
statements contained therein regarding the existence and duration of the
Unitholder Consent Period and the operation of _Section 6.4_ and any
announcement regarding the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date
as the record date for the right to receive the Merger Related Distribution,
and (b) a subsequent joint press release with respect to the expiration of (i)
the Unitholder Consent Period and (ii) MLP's right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_. Except for the joint press releases
described in the preceding sentence, neither MLP nor Parent will issue or
cause the publication of any other press release or other public announcement
(except to the extent previously issued or made in accordance with this
Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without the
prior consent of the other Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Law or by any applicable
listing Contract with the NYSE or other national securities exchange as
determined in the good faith judgment of the Party proposing to make such
release (in which case such Party will not issue or cause the publication of
such press release or other public announcement without prior consultation
with the other Party).

  

    

Section 6.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  

  

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of the MLP Entities and GP Holdings will (i)
afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access (and, with respect to
books and records, the right to copy), during normal business hours, to their
respective officers, employees, agents, properties, assets, books, offices,
facilities, Contracts, Tax Returns, Permits and records and other information
reasonably requested by Parent (in each case, whether in physical or
electronic form), (ii) furnish promptly during normal business hours such
information concerning the business, properties, offices, facilities,
Contracts, Tax Returns, Permits, assets and liabilities of the MLP Group
Entities as Parent or its Representatives reasonably request, (iii) reasonably
cooperate with Parent and its Representatives to organize and facilitate
meetings among Parent and its Representatives and the MLP Entities and their
respective Representatives to be located at the offices and facilities of the
MLP Group Entities at such times as Parent may reasonably request, (iv) use
reasonable best efforts to furnish or produce information related to the
financial or Tax records of the MLP Group Entities if reasonably requested by
Parent (which, for purposes of this _Section 6.7_ , will be deemed to be
furnished or produced upon MLP entering into an engagement with its regular
external advisors to furnish such information to Parent) and (v) reasonably
cooperate with Parent and its Representatives with respect to communications
to, and to organize and facilitate meetings with, customers, suppliers and
other key business relations of the MLP Group Entities as Parent may
reasonably request; provided, however, that such access shall be provided on a
basis that minimizes the disruption to the operations of the MLP Entities and
in no event, shall include invasive sampling or testing of the Environment;
and provided further, that the foregoing will not require the MLP Entities (i)
to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of the MLP Entities (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) would (A) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if the MLP Entities have used reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure or (B)
result in a violation of any Antitrust Laws or (ii) to disclose any privileged
information of the MLP Group Entities to the extent such disclosure would
result in the loss of such privilege (in each case, it being agreed that the
MLP Entities shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding
such access or information and thereafter the MLP Entities shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause such access or information, as
applicable, to be provided, or made available, in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to cause such a disclosure, violation or waiver).

  


 

  

(b) The MLP Entities and GP Holdings will furnish promptly to the Parent
Entities, and the Parent Entities will furnish promptly to the MLP Entities
and GP Holdings (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed
or submitted by any of them pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities Laws and a copy of any communication (including "comment letters")
received by any of them from the SEC concerning compliance with securities
Laws and (ii) all other information concerning their and their respective
Subsidiaries' business, properties and personnel as the Parent Entities or MLP
Entities and GP Holdings, as the case may be, may reasonably request,
provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and
notwithstanding any right to information under Law (to the extent such right
under Law can be waived), except as specifically provided in _Section 6.18_ ,
none of the MLP Group Entities or GP Holdings or any of their respective
Affiliates or holders of Equity Interests shall have the right at any time to
examine the Tax Returns, Tax work papers, financial statements or books and
records of the Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates for any
purpose.

  

  

(c) Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the Nondisclosure
Agreement, dated April 9, 2014, between Parent and MLP (as it may be amended
from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), Parent and its
Representatives will hold information received from the MLP Entities pursuant
to this _Section 6.7_ in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

(d) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this _Section 6.7_
will modify any of the representations and warranties of the Parties.

  

    

Section 6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The MLP Entities will give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent will give prompt notice to the MLP
Entities, of (a) any notice or other communication received by such Party (or
its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Representatives) from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that
the obtaining or making of Consent from or with such Person is or may be
required in connection with the Transactions, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such Consent is
reasonably likely to be material to the MLP Entities or Parent, (b) any
Proceedings that relate to the Transactions and are commenced or, to such
Party's Knowledge, threatened against, relate to, involve or otherwise affect
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would result in the failure to be
satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VII_ and (d) any
material failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereby which would result in
the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in
_Article VII_ ; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 6.8_ shall not cure any breach of representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect
the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice; provided,
further, that in the case of _clauses (c)_ and _(d)_ , the failure to comply
with this _Section 6.8_ shall not result in the failure to be satisfied of any
of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VII_ , or give rise to any right
to terminate this Agreement under _Article VIII_ , if the underlying fact,
circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself give rise to such
failure or right.

  

  

Section 6.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, solely to the extent that any MLP Group
Entity would be obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Person, Parent and the
Surviving Entity jointly and severally agree to (i) indemnify and hold
harmless against any cost or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any Proceeding, and provide advancement of expenses to, all
Indemnified Persons to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and
(ii) honor the provisions regarding indemnification of officers, directors,
managers and employees and advancement of expenses contained in the MLP
Charter Documents or comparable governing documents of any Subsidiary of MLP
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, irrespective of any
subsequent amendment, modification or revocation thereof.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the MLP Entities will purchase a "tail
policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have
been committed by Indemnified Persons in their capacity as such and having
coverage terms, benefits, levels of coverage (including limits, self-insured
retentions and deductibles) and other terms and conditions which are in the
aggregate not less advantageous to the Indemnified Persons as those in effect
under the director and officer insurance policies of the MLP Group Entities on
the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section 6.9_ will be in
addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the MLP
Charter Documents or the DRULPA. The provisions of this _Section 6.9_ will
survive the Closing Date for a period of six years and are expressly intended
to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs,
successors, assigns, executors and administrators; provided, however, that in
the event that any claim or claims for indemnification set forth in this
_Section 6.9_ are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims will continue until
disposition of all such claims. If Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of
their businesses or assets to any other Person, then, in each such case, to
the extent necessary, a proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity set forth in this
_Section 6.9_.

  

    

Section 6.10 _Transaction Litigation_. The MLP Entities and GP Holdings will
give Parent prompt notice of any Proceeding commenced or, to the Knowledge of
the MLP Entities, threatened, against any of them or their respective
directors, officers, managers, partners or Affiliates relating to this
Agreement or the Merger or the GP Equity Transfer (collectively, "
_Transaction Litigation_ "). The MLP Entities and GP Holdings shall consult
with Parent regarding the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation
and shall not compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to
compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Transaction
Litigation or consent to the same, without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In
connection with any Transaction Litigation and the Parties' performance of
their obligations under this _Section 6.10_ , the Parties shall enter into a
customary common interest or joint defense agreement or implement such other
techniques as reasonably required to preserve any attorney-client privilege or
other applicable legal privilege; provided, however, that the MLP Entities
shall not be required to provide information if doing so, in the opinion of
such MLP Entity's legal counsel, would cause the loss of any attorney-client
privilege or other applicable legal privilege; provided, that, if any
information is withheld pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the MLP Entities
shall inform Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld and the
Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to enable the MLP Entities to
provide such information without causing the loss of any attorney-client or
other applicable legal privilege.

  

  

Section 6.11 _Cooperation Regarding MLP Debt_. If requested by Parent at any
time after the date hereof, the MLP Entities shall, and shall cause MLP's
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with, and use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist, Parent and Merger Sub in taking all actions necessary to,
(a) effect a discharge, covenant defeasance, redemption, amendment or similar
action in connection with any notes or bonds issued pursuant to the Indenture
(all to be effective on or after the Closing Date), (b) effect any consent
solicitation related to any provisions of the Indenture prior to the Closing
(such consent to be effective on or after the Closing Date) and (c)
contemporaneously with the Closing and on behalf of MLP and its Subsidiaries,
(i) repay or cause to be repaid all Indebtedness, liabilities and other
obligations outstanding under MLP's existing credit facilities or secured by
the collateral therefor, (ii) terminate or cause to be terminated all
commitments of the lenders to lend under such credit facilities and (iii)
terminate or release or cause to be terminated and released any and all
guarantees of, and Liens securing, such Indebtedness, liabilities and
obligations, in each case, including obtaining customary payoff letters and
causing the filing of any UCC-3 termination statements, mortgage releases or
similar documents evidencing termination or release of such Liens; provided
that, with respect to any cooperation or assistance under this _Section 6.11_
, the MLP Entities and GP Holdings shall not be required to incur any out-of-
pocket, third party costs (it being understood that any such costs would be
paid or advanced by or on behalf of Parent). The Parties shall, and the MLP
Entities shall cause the other MLP Group Entities to, reasonably cooperate
with the other Parties in the preparation, execution, delivery and filing of
the necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with any actions
reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this _Section 6.11_.

  

    

Section 6.12 _Fees and Expenses_. Parent or its designee shall pay all charges
and expenses of the Paying Agent in connection with the provisions set forth
in _Article II_. Subject to _Section 6.3(d)_ of the MLP Disclosure Letter, all
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions including all
legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and
expenses of third Parties incurred by a Party in connection with the
negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Transactions, will be the obligation of the respective Party incurring
such fees and expenses.

  

  

Section 6.13 _Employee Benefits_.

  

  

(a) _Compensation; Benefit Plans_.

  

 

  

(i) For a period of 12 months following the Closing Date, Parent shall (or
shall cause one of its Affiliates to) (A) provide to each employee of the
Surviving Entity, its Subsidiaries and MLP GP (collectively, the " _Employees_
") a base salary or hourly wage that is no less than the base salary or hourly
wage provided to such Employee as of the date hereof and (B) continue in
effect the hourly pay practices that are applicable to the Employees as of the
Closing Date and are set forth on _Section 6.13(a)(i)_ of the MLP Disclosure
Letter.

  

  

(ii) Beginning on the Closing Date and continuing through the last day of the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs (the " _Transition Date_ "),
Parent shall (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to) (A) provide each
Employee with employee benefits pursuant to the MLP Benefit Plans (including
the MLP Annual Discretionary Bonus Award plan) that are in effect as of the
Closing Date, (B) process payroll for the Employees in the same manner as
payroll is processed for the Employees as of the Closing Date and (C) continue
in effect those policies that are applicable to the Employees as of the
Closing Date and are set forth on _Section 6.13(a)(ii)_ of the MLP Disclosure
Letter. Beginning on the day immediately following the Transition Date, Parent
shall (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to) provide each Employee with
employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits provided to other similarly situated employees of Parent.

  


 

 

  

(b) _Severance Benefits_. Subject to the applicable Employee signing a release
in a form and at a time approved by Parent, Parent shall (or shall cause one
of its Affiliates to) provide severance benefits in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the MLP Change in Control Severance Plan, a copy of which is
set forth on _Section 6.13(b)_ of the MLP Disclosure Letter. Parent shall not
(and shall cause its Affiliates not to) amend, modify, suspend or terminate
_Section 6.13(b)_ of the MLP Disclosure Letter (including any annexes thereto)
at any time before the day following the first anniversary of the Closing Date
in any way that would adversely affect the rights of any Qualifying Employee
(as such term is defined in _Section 6.13(b)_ of the MLP Disclosure Letter
(including any annexes thereto)).

  

    

(c) _Retention Bonus_. On the first payroll date of MLP following the 12 month
anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall (or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to) pay to each Employee who has remained continuously employed by
the Surviving Entity, its Subsidiaries or MLP GP from the Closing Date until
the date that is 12 months following the Closing Date a retention bonus in an
amount equal to eight (8) weeks of such Employee's then-current base pay.

  

  

(d) _MLP 401(k) Plan_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall (or shall cause one of its Affiliates to) continue in effect the
MLP GP Profit Sharing 401(k) Plan (the " _MLP 401(k) Plan_ ") through the
Transition Date and shall make matching contributions and profit sharing
contributions determined in the same manner in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice. On the Transition Date, each individual who is an Employee
on the Closing Date shall become one hundred percent (100%) vested in any
account balance he or she has under the MLP 401(k) Plan on the Transition
Date, provided that Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to,
take any and all actions necessary, including amending the MLP 401(k) Plan, to
effectuate the foregoing and to ensure that no amounts will be forfeited on an
Employee's termination of employment following the Closing if such Employee
maintains an account balance under the MLP 401(k) Plan on the Transition Date.

  

  

(e) _New Plans_. If, following the Closing Date, Employees become eligible to
participate in employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements that are not
MLP Benefit Plans (any such new plan, a " _New Plan_ ") or in any MLP Benefit
Plan in which such Employee did not participate prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall credit each such Employee for the service that such Employee
performed for an MLP Entity or one of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
Date for benefits eligibility purposes (including vacation and paid time off),
severance determination purposes and, except with respect to any equity
compensation plan and programs, vesting purposes, but not for benefit accrual
purposes, and only to the extent that such service was credited by an MLP
Entity or one of its Subsidiaries under the corresponding MLP Benefit Plan as
of the Closing Date. With respect to any New Plan, Parent shall (i) waive all
pre-existing conditions, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements, waiting
periods and any other eligibility requirements of such New Plan for such
Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent they were
inapplicable to, or were satisfied under, the applicable MLP Benefit Plans and
(ii) cause any expenses incurred by any Employee of any MLP Entity or its
Subsidiaries and his or her covered dependents pursuant to any MLP Benefit
Plan during the portion of the plan year of such MLP Benefit Plan ending on
the date such Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins,
to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
under the New Plan as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with the New
Plan, to the extent such amounts had been taken into account under the
applicable MLP Benefit Plan.

  

  

(f) _No Employee Third Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the generality
of _Section 9.7_ , the provisions of this _Section 6.13_ are for the sole
benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or
implied, is intended or will be construed to confer upon or give to any Person
(including any current or former employee of any MLP Entity or any of their
respective Affiliates) other than the Parties and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(including with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 6.13_ )
under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Section 6.13_ amends, or will be deemed to amend (or prevent the amendment or
termination of) any MLP Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plans sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by Parent. Parent has no obligation to continue
to employ or retain the services of any Employee for any period of time
following the Effective Time and, except as specifically provided in this
_Section 6.13_ , Parent will be entitled to modify any compensation or
benefits provided to, and any other terms or conditions of employment of, any
such Employees in its absolute discretion.

  

    

Section 6.14 _Termination of Trading and Deregistration_. The MLP Entities
will cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NYSE
to enable (a) the delisting of the Common Units from the NYSE and the
termination of trading of the Common Units on the Closing Date and prior to

Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any

to the Transactions, the MLP Entities and their respective boards of directors
or managers and/or the Parent Entities and their respective boards of
directors or managers, as applicable, will grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and the
Parties will otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
Takeover Law on the Merger.

  

  

Section 6.16 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, to the extent
reasonably necessary, the MLP Entities will take all such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause the Merger, including any dispositions of
Common Units and Phantom Units resulting from the Merger by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the MLP Entities to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

  

  

Section 6.17 _FIRPTA Certificates_. Each Party will, and will cause its
Affiliates (and their respective officers and directors) to, cooperate with
each other Party to obtain, at the Closing, from each of the Persons listed on
_Section 6.17_ of the MLP Disclosure Letter a certificate, dated as of the
Closing Date and substantially in the form and to the effect of _Exhibit C_ ,
which satisfies the requirements set forth in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(b)(2), attesting that such Person is not a "foreign person" for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes; provided that if any Person listed on _Section
6.17_ of the MLP Disclosure Letter does not deliver such certificate, Parent
and Merger Sub's sole remedy shall be to withhold, or cause to be withheld,
from the consideration payable to such Person pursuant to this Agreement any
amounts required to be withheld pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code. At the
Closing, MLP shall deliver to Parent a certificate, dated as of the Closing
date and substantially in the form and to the effect of _Exhibit D_ , which

(a) Unitholders will be allocated all items of income, gain, loss, deduction
and credit of MLP for income Tax purposes through and including the Closing
Date.

  

  

(b) MLP will be responsible for (i) the preparation, filing and delivery of

consistent with the past practices of the MLP unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, and (ii) the delivery to the Unitholders of all MLP Income Tax
Returns of such Unitholders required to be filed on or after to the Closing
Date; provided, that any out-of-pocket, third party costs, fees or expenses
incurred with respect to the foregoing shall be borne by MLP. GP Holdings will
provide to Parent copies of all such MLP Income Tax Returns at least 30 days
prior to the date on which such MLP Income Tax Return is required to be filed
or delivered for Parent's review and comment, and any reasonable comments of
Parent shall be considered in good faith for incorporation into such MLP
Income Tax Return by GP Holdings prior to filing by MLP or delivery by GP
Holdings, as applicable.

  

  

(d) Following the Closing, the Parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates (and their respective officers, directors, employees or agents) to,
cooperate with the other Parties regarding the preparation and filing of all
MLP Income Tax Returns, including providing the other Parties with reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to their respective offices, employees,
outside accountants, books, records and Tax Returns, subject to the proviso in
_Section 6.7(b)_.

Merger Sub or any Unitholder (including the Sponsors), whether at or prior to
the Closing. Following the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause its

federal income Tax purposes, and not as a disregarded entity or an association
taxable as a corporation.

  

  

(f) Following the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including MLP) not to, amend, refile or otherwise modify any MLP Income Tax
Returns filed prior to the Closing Date, except with the consent of GP
Holdings or as required by applicable Law.

(a) Prior to the Closing, each MLP Entity and GP Holdings will, and will cause
the MLP Group Entities to, take such actions as are necessary or required to
(i) terminate, effective at or prior to the Closing, (A) each Contract that is
listed in _Section 6.19_ of the MLP Disclosure Letter or (B) at Parent's
request, any Contract that is not disclosed in _Section 3.22_ of the MLP
Disclosure Letter where the failure of such Contract to be so disclosed would
cause the representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.22_ not to be
true and correct and (ii) ensure that the MLP Group Entities have no further
liabilities or obligations thereunder from and after the Closing.

  

    

(b) MLP will cause its transfer agent to enter stop transfer orders and make
notations on the MLP's records pursuant to the terms of the Support
Agreements.

effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Parent Material Adverse
Effect" set forth in any individual such representation or warranty) would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

  

    

(b) _Performance of Obligations of the Parent Entities_. The Parent Entities
shall have performed all obligations that are required to be performed by them
under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date (i) in all respects for
obligations with respect to which performance of them is qualified by
"materiality" and (ii) in all material respects for all other obligations.

  

  

(c) _Certificate_. MLP shall have received at the Closing a certificate signed
on behalf of Parent by a senior executive officer of Parent to the effect that
the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.3(a)_ and _7.3(b)_ have been
satisfied.

  

  

  

Section 7.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. No Party may rely on the
failure of any condition set forth in _Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_ or _7.3_ , as the
case may be, to be satisfied, if such Party's failure to perform any material
obligation required to be performed by it has been the primary cause of, or
primarily results in, such failure.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

 _TERMINATION_

  

  

Section 8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

the MLP GP Board and the board of managers of Parent, respectively.

  

  

(b) by either of MLP or Parent:

  

  

(i) by written notice to the other Party at any time after the Outside Date,
if the Closing has not been consummated on or before the Outside Date;
provided that, if on the Outside Date the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Sections 7.1(b)_ (Regulatory Approval) or _7.1(c)_ (No Injunctions or
Restraints) (but for purposes of _Section 7.1(c)_ , only if such Restraint is
attributable to Antitrust Laws) have not been satisfied, but all other
conditions to Closing in _Article VII_ have been satisfied or are capable of
being satisfied, then the Outside Date may be extended on one or more
occasions to a date not later than May 27, 2015 at the option of MLP or Parent
by providing written notice to the other Parties at or before 11:59 p.m.
Houston, Texas time on the Outside Date; and provided, further, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ will not be
available (x) to a Party if the inability to satisfy such conditions was due
to the failure of such Party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement or (y) to a Party if the other Party has filed (and is then
pursuing) an action seeking specific performance as permitted by _Section 9.9_
; or

  

  

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 7.1(c)_ is in
effect and has become final and nonappealable.

  

    

(c) by Parent:

  

  

(i) if either MLP Entity or GP Holdings has breached any of its obligations
under _Section 6.4_ (No Solicitation or Withdrawal of Recommendation),
excluding any such breaches that are de minimis in nature and do not adversely
affect the Parent Entities or the Transactions;

  

  

(ii) if either MLP Entity or GP Holdings has breached any of its respective
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement (or if any such
representations or warranties fail to be true) or either MLP Entity or GP
Holdings has failed to perform any of its respective covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure (A) would (if it occurred
or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ and (B) is incapable of
being cured, or is not cured by the applicable MLP Entity or GP Holdings by
the earlier of (x) the Outside Date and (y) 30 days following receipt of
written notice from Parent of such breach or failure;

  

  

(iii) (A) if a copy of the duly obtained MLP Unitholder Consent, certified as
true and complete by an executive officer of each of the MLP Entities, has not
been delivered to Parent within 24 hours following execution of this Agreement
or (B) if copies of duly obtained MLP Amendment Consents, certified as true
and complete by an executive officer of each of the MLP Entities, have not
been delivered to Parent within 72 hours following the later of (1) execution
of an amendment of this Agreement and (2) Parent's request to seek to obtain
the MLP Amendment Consents, in the case of each of _clauses (1)_ and _(2)_ ,
as contemplated by _Section 6.4(d)_ ;

  

  

(iv) if the MLP GP Board has made a Withdrawal of Recommendation (whether or
not in compliance with _Section 6.4(c)_ (Certain Permitted Withdrawals of
Recommendation)); or

  

  

(v) if a Divestiture Request has been made; provided that (x) Parent must
exercise its right to terminate with respect to a Divestiture Request under
this _Section 8.1(c)(v)_ within 10 Business Days of the earlier of (1) its
receipt of such Divestiture Request and (2) its receipt of notice of such
Divestiture Request from MLP pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_ and (y) prior to,
and as a condition of, any termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(c)(v)_ , Parent shall have paid the Parent Termination Fee
to MLP pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)(ii)_.

  

  

(d) by MLP:

  

  

(i) if either Parent or Merger Sub has breached any of its respective
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement (or if any such
representations or warranties fail to be true) or either Parent or Merger Sub
has failed to perform its respective covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure (A) would (if it occurred or was continuing
as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_ and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is not
cured, by Parent by the earlier of (1) the Outside Date and (2) 30 days
following receipt of written notice from MLP of such breach or failure;
provided that MLP will not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 8.1(d)_ if MLP is then in breach of _Section 6.4_ (No
Solicitation or Withdrawal of Recommendation), excluding any such breaches
that are de minimis in nature and do not adversely affect the Parent Entities
or the Transactions; or

  

    

(ii) if MLP GP Board has made a Withdrawal of Recommendation in compliance
with _Section 6.4(c)_ and _Section 6.4(d)_ ; provided that prior to, and as a
condition of, any termination of this Agreement by MLP pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ , MLP shall have paid the MLP Termination Fee to Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_.

  

  

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  

  

(a) _Generally_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided
in _Section 8.1_ , written notice thereof will be given to the other Party or
Parties, specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement will become null and void (other than
the provisions in _Section 6.12_ (Fees and Expenses) and this _Section 8.2_
and in _Section 6.7(c)_ (Confidentiality), and the provisions in _Article IX_
(Miscellaneous), all of which will survive termination of this Agreement).
Upon termination pursuant to this _Article VIII_ , there will be no liability
on the part of any Parent Entity, MLP Entity or GP Holdings or their
respective directors, managers, officers and Affiliates, provided that, upon
the termination of this Agreement and except as provided in _Section 8.2(f)_ ,
nothing will be deemed to (i) release any Party from any liability to any
other Party for any breach by such Party of this Agreement prior to such
termination or (ii) impair the right of any Party to compel specific
performance by any other Party of its obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

(b) _MLP Termination Fee_.

  

  

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(i)_ , _Section 8.1(c)(iii)(B)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iv)_ , then
MLP shall pay to Parent a termination fee of $57,000,000 (the " _MLP
Termination Fee_ ") promptly (but in no event later than two Business Days)
after such termination, by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  

  

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by MLP pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ , then MLP shall pay Parent the MLP Termination Fee prior
to, and as a condition of, such termination.

  

    

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (A) (1) by Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ , if due to GP Holdings' or either MLP
Entity's failure to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement (but not if due to any breach or failure to be true of any of the
representations or warranties of the MLP Entities or GP Holdings set forth in
this Agreement or a breach of a covenant or agreement in _Section 6.4_ ), or
(2) by Parent or MLP pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ at a time when this
Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ , if due
to any MLP Entity's or GP Holdings' failure to perform any covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement (but not if due to any breach or failure
to be true of any of the representations or warranties of the MLP Entities or
GP Holdings set forth in this Agreement), and (B) within 12 months after any
such termination (1) any MLP Group Entity or GP Holdings or any of their
respective Affiliates shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to, or shall have approved or recommended to MLP's
Limited Partners or otherwise not opposed, any Alternative Proposal or (2)
there shall have been consummated an Alternative Proposal, then MLP shall pay
the MLP Termination Fee to Parent upon the earlier of (x) the consummation of
such Alternative Proposal and (y) entry into such Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds; provided that the
MLP Termination Fee payable pursuant to this _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_ shall be
reduced by the Expense Reimbursement, if any, actually paid to Parent pursuant
to _Section 8.2(d)_ and for purposes of this _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_ , the
references to "5% or more" in the definition of Alternative Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to "more than 20%."

  

  

(c) _Parent Termination Fee_.

  

  

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or MLP
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 8.1(b)(ii)_ , in each case, if the
conditions to Closing set forth in _Sections 7.1(b)_ (Regulatory Approval) or
_7.1(c)_ (No Injunctions or Restraints) (but for purposes of _Section 7.1(c)_
, only if such Restraint is attributable to Antitrust Laws) have not been
satisfied, but all other conditions to Closing in _Article VII_ have been
satisfied or are capable of being satisfied (provided that (x) the inability
to satisfy such conditions was not due to the failure of the MLP Entities or
GP Holdings to perform any of their respective obligations under this
Agreement and (y) prior to such termination, a Divestiture Request shall have
been made and Parent shall not have complied with such Divestiture Request),
then Parent shall pay to MLP a termination fee of $57,000,000 (the " _Parent
Termination Fee_ ") promptly (but in no event later than two Business Days)
after such termination, by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  

  

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(v)_ , then Parent shall pay MLP the Parent Termination Fee
prior to, and as a condition of, such termination.

  

  

(d) _Expense Reimbursement_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated,
(i) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ due to any MLP Entity's or GP
Holdings' failure to perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement (other than a covenant or agreement in _Section 6.4_ ), or (ii) by
Parent or MLP pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ at a time when this Agreement
was terminable by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ due to any MLP
Entity's or GP Holdings' failure to perform any covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement, then MLP shall pay to Parent its and its Affiliates'
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with
their investigation, consideration, documentation, diligence and negotiation
of this Agreement and the Transactions, including all fees and expenses of
Parent's and its Affiliates' Representatives (the _" Expense Reimbursement"_),
by wire transfer of immediately available funds; provided that the Expense
Reimbursement shall not exceed $7,500,000 and MLP shall not be obligated to
reimburse Parent for any internal cost allocations or charges among its
Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, the Expense Reimbursement shall not be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent or Merger Sub against the MLP Entities
or GP Holdings.

  

    

(e) _Collection Fees and Expenses_. Each Party acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the Merger
and the other Transactions, and that, without these agreements, no Party would
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if MLP or Parent, as applicable, fails
to promptly pay any amount due under this _Section 8.2_ , and, in order to
obtain such payment, the payee Party commences a Proceeding that results in an
Order against the payor Party, the payee Party shall pay to the payor Party
the costs and expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses) in connection
with such Proceeding and shall pay interest on the amount payable pursuant to
such Order, compounded quarterly, at the prime lending rate prevailing during
such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily
basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid (but for such
Proceeding) until the date of actual payment.

  

  

(f) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Except as provided in _Section 8.2(e)_ :

  

  

(i) In the event that the MLP Termination Fee is paid by MLP to Parent in
accordance with this _Section 8.2_ , such payment shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the MLP Entities and GP
Holdings for any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, fees,
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements), judgments,
inquiries and fines suffered as a result of any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement by the MLP Entities or GP
Holdings.

  

  

(ii) In the event that the Parent Termination Fee is paid by Parent to MLP in
accordance with this _Section 8.2_ , such payment shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the MLP Entities and GP Holdings against Parent and Merger
Sub for any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, fees,
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements), judgments,
inquiries and fines suffered as a result of any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub.

  

  

(iii) In the event that the MLP Termination Fee is paid by MLP to Parent or
the Parent Termination Fee is paid by Parent to MLP, in each case, in
accordance with this _Section 8.2_ , no Party or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective former, current or future Representatives, agents,
partners, managers, members, stockholders, assignees or Affiliates shall have
any further liability or obligations relating to or arising out of this
Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not impair (x) the
rights of any Party to obtain injunctive relief pursuant to _Section 9.9_
prior to any termination of this Agreement or (y) the rights of Parent or
Merger Sub under the Support Agreements.

  

    

ARTICLE IX

  

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

  

  

Section 9.1 _No Survival, Etc_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the representations, warranties and agreements of each Party hereto
will remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of any other Party hereto, whether prior to
or after the execution of this Agreement. The representations, warranties and
agreements in this Agreement will terminate at the Effective Time or, except
as otherwise provided in _Section 8.2_ , upon the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1,_ as the case may be, except that (x) the
agreements set forth in _Articles II_ and _IX_ and _Sections 6.9_ , _6.12_ ,
_6.13_ , _6.14_ and _6.18_ and any other agreement in this Agreement that
contemplates performance after the Effective Time will survive the Effective
Time and (y) those set forth in _Sections 6.7(c)_ , _6.12_ and _8.2_ , and
this _Article IX_ will survive termination of this Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreement will (i) survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate as of the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 9.2 _Amendment or Modification_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or modified in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the MLP Unitholder Consent or an MLP
Amendment Consents (if applicable), by written agreement of the Parties, by
action taken or authorized by the MLP GP Board and the board of managers of
Parent; provided, however, that following approval of the Transactions by the
Unitholders, there will be no amendment or change to the provisions of this
Agreement which by Law would require further approval by the Unitholders
without such approval.

  

  

Section 9.3 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any Party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other Party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other Party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other Party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such Party's conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by any MLP Entity or any Parent Entity in exercising any right hereunder
will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any such
extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party.

  

  

Section 9.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the other Parties, except that Parent and Merger Sub may assign, in
their respective sole discretion, any or all of their respective rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Affiliates of
such Party, but no such assignment will relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of
its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment not permitted under this _Section 9_ _.4_ will be null and void.

  

    

Section 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together will constitute one and the same agreement) and will become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to the other Parties.

  

  

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the MLP Disclosure Letter and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior Contracts, both written and oral, among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and thereof. In the event of a
conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will control.

  

  

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for (a) _Section 6.9_ and
_Section 9.13_ , which will inure to the benefit of the Persons benefiting
therefrom, who are expressly intended to be third party beneficiaries thereof,
(b) if the Closing occurs, the right of Unitholders to receive the Merger
Related Consideration and (c) if the Closing occurs, the right of holders of
Phantom Units to receive the Phantom Unit Consideration, this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than the Parties any
rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties
and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of
the Knowledge of any of the Parties, and consequently, may not accurately
characterize actual facts or circumstances.

  

  

Section 9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  

  

(a) This Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract,
tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
Contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that State.

  

  

(b) By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Party irrevocably agrees
that any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns, will
be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Proceeding for
itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any
court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 9_
_.8_ , (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (x) the Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (y) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (z) this Agreement, or
the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

  

    

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
9.8(c)_.

  

  

Section 9.9 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and it is
accordingly agreed that the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with
this _Section 9_ _.9_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) either Party
has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each Party further
agrees that no Party will be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section 9_ _.9_ , and each Party irrevocably
waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument. For the avoidance of doubt, under no
circumstances shall Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the MLP Group
Entities and GP Holdings, on the other hand, be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance in accordance with this _Section
9.9_ and the MLP Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, in
respect of the same underlying claim.

  

    

Section 9.10 _Notices_. All notices, requests, permissions, waivers and other
communications hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed to have been
duly given (a) when sent, if sent by facsimile (which is confirmed) or
electronic mail (provided that no electronic notice of non-delivery is
received by the sender), (b) when delivered, if delivered personally to the
intended recipient and (c) one Business Day following sending by overnight

Section 9.11 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision will be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far

unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that Transactions are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 _INSTRUCTIONS FOR SURRENDERING BOOK-ENTRY POSITIONS_

  

(Please read carefully the instructions below)

  


 

  

1. Method of Delivery: This Letter must be sent or delivered to the Paying Agent.

  

  

2. Payment in the Same Name: If the check is to be issued or the wire is to be sent to an account in the same name as the surrendered book-entry position(s) is (are) registered, this Letter should be completed and signed exactly as the surrendered book-entry position(s) is (are) registered. Signature guarantees are not required if the registered owner of the book-entry position(s) hereby signs this Letter and the section entitled "Special Payment Instructions" is not completed or if such book entry position(s) is (are) surrendered for the account of an Eligible Institution. If any of the book-entry-position(s) surrendered hereby is (are) owned by two or more joint owners, all such owners must sign this Letter exactly as the book-entry position(s) is (are) registered. If any book-entry position(s) is (are) registered in different record holder names, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many separate Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations. If this Letter is executed by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officers or other duly authorized representatives of corporations or other entities, or others acting in a fiduciary capacity who are not identified as such in the registration, this Letter must be accompanied by proper evidence of the signer\'s authority to act on behalf of the record holder(s).

  

  

3. Payment in Different Name: If the section entitled "Special Payment Instructions" is completed, then signatures on this Letter must be guaranteed by a firm that is a bank, broker, dealer, credit union, savings association or other entity that is an Eligible Institution. If (i) the book entry position(s) surrendered hereby is (are) registered in the name of a person other than the signer of this Letter, (ii) payment is to be made to a person other than the signer(s) of this Letter or (iii) payment is to be made to a person other than the registered owner(s) of the surrendered book-entry position(s), then this Letter must be accompanied by a duly executed instrument evidencing the transfer of the surrendered book-entry position(s), signed by the transferor(s) exactly as the name(s) of the registered owner(s) appear(s) with respect to such book-entry position(s), with the signature(s) on such instrument guaranteed by an Eligible Institution.

  

  

4. Special Payment and Delivery Instructions: Indicate the name in which payment is to be made, and address to which any check is to be sent or account to which any wire transfer is to be sent (as applicable), if different from the name and/or address or account of the record holder with respect to the surrendered book-entry position(s). If Special Payment Instructions have been completed, a Substitute Form W-9 must also be completed for the person named therein, and that person will be considered the record owner of the surrendered book-entry positions.

  

  

5. Letter of Transmittal Required: You will not receive your check or wire unless and until you deliver this Letter, properly completed and duly executed, to the Paying Agent.

  

  

6. Substitute Form W-9: Under the federal income tax law, a non-exempt unitholder is required to provide the Paying Agent with such unitholder\'s correct Taxpayer Identification Number ("TIN") on the enclosed Substitute Form W-9. If the book-entry positions are in more than one name or are not in the name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed Substitute Form W-9 guidelines for additional guidance on which number to report. Failure to provide the information on the form may subject the surrendering unitholder to 28% backup withholding on the payment of any cash. The surrendering unitholder must check the box in Part 4 if a TIN has not been issued and the unitholder has applied for a number or intends to apply for a number in the near future. If a TIN has been applied for and the Paying Agent is not provided with a TIN before payment is made, the Paying Agent will withhold 28% on all payments to such surrendering unitholders of any cash consideration due for their former Units. Please review the enclosed Guidelines for Certification of TIN on Substitute Form W-9 for additional details on what TIN to give the Paying Agent.

  


 

  

7. Unit Transfer Taxes: If payment is to be made to any person other than the record holder, or if surrendered book-entry position(s) is (are) registered in the name of any record holder other than the person(s) signing this Letter, the amount of any transfer taxes (whether imposed on the record holder or such other person) payable as a result of the transfer to such other person will be deducted from the payment for such Units if satisfactory evidence of the payment of such taxes, or exemption therefrom, is not submitted.

IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

  

  

Under current U.S. federal income tax law, a non-exempt unitholder who tenders
Units that are accepted for exchange may be subject to backup withholding. In
order to avoid such backup withholding, the unitholder must provide the Paying
Agent with such unitholder's correct taxpayer identification number and
certify that such unitholder is not subject to such backup withholding by
completing the Substitute Form W-9 provided herewith. In general, if a
unitholder is an individual, the taxpayer identification number is the Social
Security number of such individual. If the Paying Agent is not provided with
the correct taxpayer identification number, the unitholder may be subject to a
$50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. For further information
concerning backup withholding and instructions for completing the Substitute
Form W-9 (including how to obtain a taxpayer identification number if you do
not have one and how to complete the Substitute Form W-9 if the Unit book-
entry positions are held in more than one name), consult the enclosed
Guidelines for Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number on Substitute
Form W-9.

  

  

Certain unitholders (including, among others, all corporations and certain
foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and reporting
requirements. In order to satisfy the Paying Agent that a foreign individual
qualifies as an exempt recipient, such unitholder must submit a statement,
signed under penalties of perjury, attesting to that individual's exempt
status, on a properly completed Form W-8BEN, or successor form. Such
statements can be obtained from the Paying Agent.

  

  

Failure to complete the Substitute Form W-9 will not, by itself, cause the
Unit book-entry positions to be deemed invalidly tendered, but may require the
Paying Agent to withhold a portion of the amount of any payments made pursuant
to the Merger. Backup withholding is not an additional federal income tax.
Rather, the federal income tax liability of a person subject to backup
withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding
results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained provided that the
required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

  

  

NOTE: FAILURE TO COMPLETE AND RETURN THE SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 MAY RESULT IN
BACKUP WITHHOLDING OF A PORTION OF ANY PAYMENTS MADE TO YOU PURSUANT TO THE
MERGER. PLEASE REVIEW THE ENCLOSED GUIDELINES FOR CERTIFICATION OF TAXPAYER
IDENTIFICATION NUMBER ON SUBSTITUTE FORM W-9 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.

Privacy Act Notice. -- Section 6109 requires most recipients of dividend,
interest, or certain other income to give taxpayer identification numbers to
payers who must report the payments to the IRS. The IRS uses the numbers for
identification purposes and to help verify the accuracy of tax returns. The
IRS may also provide this information to the Department of Justice for civil
and criminal litigation and to cities, states and the District of Columbia to
carry out their tax laws. The IRS may also disclose this information to other
countries under a tax treaty, or to Federal and state agencies to enforce
Federal nontax criminal laws and to combat terrorism. Payers must be given the
numbers whether or not recipients are required to file tax returns. Payers
must generally withhold a portion of taxable interest, dividend, and certain
other payments to a payee who does not furnish a taxpayer identification
number to a payer. Certain penalties may also apply.

  

  

Penalties

  

  

(1) Penalty for Failure to Furnish Taxpayer Identification Number. -- If you
fail to furnish your taxpayer identification number to a payer, you are
subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due
to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

  

  

(2) Civil Penalty for False Information With Respect to Withholding. -- If you
make a false statement with no reasonable basis which results in no imposition
of backup withholding, you are subject to a penalty of $500.

  

  

(3) Criminal Penalty for Falsifying Information. -- Willfully falsifying
certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including
fines and/or imprisonment.

  

  

(4) Misuse of Taxpayer Identification Numbers.--If the requester discloses or
uses taxpayer identification numbers in violation of federal law, the
requester may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.
