Each of the Buyer and the Seller acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is expressly waived. <B></B> </P>

its Subsidiaries, Baker&nbsp;&amp; Hostetler LLP (&#147;<U>Baker</U>&#148;) shall be permitted to represent the Seller and Mr.&nbsp;Milstein after the Closing in connection with any matter, including anything related to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any other agreements referenced herein and any disagreement and dispute relating thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing, Baker shall be permitted to represent the Seller, any of its
Affiliates, and any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation, transaction or dispute (including any litigation, arbitration or other adversary proceeding) with the Buyer, the Company or any of their agents or Affiliates under or
relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement and any related matter, such as claims or disputes arising under other agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement, including with respect to any
indemnification claims. As to all communications among Baker, the Company, the Seller and any of their respective Affiliates that relate solely to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of
client confidence belongs to the Seller and may be controlled by the Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates after the Closing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent
that Baker has represented the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any Action unrelated to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, as to all communications between Baker and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the attendant
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection, and expectation of client confidentiality applicable thereto belongs to the Company or its Subsidiaries. Upon and after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall cease to have
any attorney-client relationship with Baker, unless and to the extent Baker is specifically engaged in writing by the Company to represent the Company after the Closing and either such engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to the
Seller or the Seller consents in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such representation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by Baker after the Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions hereof. </P>

intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable pursuant to its terms and that the Buyer and the Seller would be irreparably harmed if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their terms and that
monetary damages would not provide adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy to which a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-breaching</FONT> party may be entitled at law, a
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-breaching</FONT> party shall be entitled to injunctive relief without the posting of any bond or other security to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof,
and the breaching party waives the defense that an adequate remedy at law may exist. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither MGP nor any subsidiary or affiliate thereof, other than the Buyer, shall be required to acquire the
Membership Interests or any other interests in the Business or its assets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">[The remainder of this page is intentionally left blank.] </P>
