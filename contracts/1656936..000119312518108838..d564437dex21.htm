not as an arbitrator) as to each such disputed item and the amount of the
Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Transaction Expenses, which determination shall be final and binding on the
parties for all purposes hereunder and shall not be subject to appeal or
further review. The Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only
those items and amounts in the Sellers and the Buyers respective
calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Cash, Closing
Indebtedness and Closing Transaction Expenses that are identified as being
items and amounts to which the Seller and the Buyer have been unable to agree
and will apply the Applicable Accounting Principles. In resolving any disputed
item, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall be PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if such firm is unable or
unwilling to act, such other independent public accounting firm as shall be
agreed in writing by the Seller and the Buyer. The Seller and the Buyer shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting
Firm to render a written decision resolving the matters submitted to it
as promptly as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days
following the submission thereof. Judgment may be entered upon the written
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with Section
10.9. In acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm will be
entitled to the powers, privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.

(d) The costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to Section 2.4(c), including
the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by the Seller and the
Buyer in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by
the Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
at the time the determination of such firm is rendered on the merits of the
matters submitted. The fees and disbursements of the Representatives of each
party incurred in connection with the preparation or review of the Final
Closing Statement and preparation or review of any Notice of Disagreement, as
applicable, shall be borne by such party.

 



16 (e) The Buyer and the Seller will, and will cause the Company (in the case of
the Seller, prior to the Closing and, in the case of the Buyer, during the
period from and after the date of delivery of the Final Closing Statement
through the resolution of any adjustment to the Purchase Price contemplated by
this Section 2.4) to afford the other party and its Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice, to the personnel, properties, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and to any other information reasonably requested for purposes
of preparing and reviewing the calculations contemplated by this Section 2.4.
Each party shall authorize its accountants to disclose work papers generated
by such accountants in connection with preparing and reviewing the
calculations of the Net Working Capital, Cash and Indebtedness as specified in
this Section 2.4; _provided_ , that such accountants shall not be obligated to
make any work papers available except in accordance with such accountants
disclosure procedures and then only after the non-client party has signed an
agreement relating to access to such work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such accountants. 

(f) The Estimated Purchase Price shall be adjusted, upwards or downwards, as
follows:

 

(i) For the purposes of this Agreement, the " _Net Adjustment Amount_ " means
an amount, which may be positive or negative, equal to (A) the Closing Net
Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4 _minus_ the
Estimated Net Working Capital, _plus_ (B) the Closing Cash as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.4  _minus_ the Estimated Cash, _plus_
(C) the Estimated Indebtedness _minus_ the Closing Indebtedness as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.4, _plus_ (D) the Estimated Transaction
Expenses _minus_ the Closing Transaction Expenses as finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.4;

(ii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, the Estimated Purchase Price
shall be adjusted upwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount. In
such event, (A) the Seller shall deliver written notice to the Escrow Agent
and the Buyer specifying the Net Adjustment Amount, (B) the Buyer shall pay
the Net Adjustment Amount to the Seller and (C) the Escrow Agent shall pay all
funds in the Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Seller; and

 

(iii) If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative (in which case the " _Net
Adjustment Amount_ " for purposes of this clause (iii) shall be deemed to be
equal to the absolute value of such amount), the Estimated Purchase Price
shall be adjusted downwards in an amount equal to the Net Adjustment Amount.
In such event, the Buyer shall deliver written notice to the Escrow Agent and
the Seller specifying the Net Adjustment Amount, and the Escrow Agent shall
pay the Net Adjustment Amount out of the Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Buyer
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If the
Adjustment Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover the entire amount payable to
the Buyer pursuant hereto, then the Escrow Agent shall distribute the entire
Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Buyer as provided in the Escrow Agreement, and
the Seller, on or prior to the same date as the Escrow Agent distributes the
Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Buyer pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, shall
pay an amount to the Buyer equal to the amount of such deficiency ("
_Adjustment Deficiency Amount_ "). If the Seller does not have a sufficient
amount of funds to pay the Buyer the Adjustment Deficiency Amount, Mr.
Milstein shall pay the Buyer the Adjustment Deficiency Amount. In the event
that the Seller or Mr. Milstein shall fail to pay the amount of such
deficiency within the time period specified in the

 



17  immediately preceding sentence, the Buyer may, in its sole discretion,
deliver written notice to the Escrow Agent, the Seller and Mr. Milstein
specifying such amount, and the Escrow Agent shall pay such amount out of the
Retention Escrow Fund to the Buyer in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement; _provided_ , that the Seller or Mr. Milstein (A) shall promptly
restore the Retention Escrow Fund to the extent any funds are so paid and (B)
shall remain liable in the event the Retention Escrow Fund is insufficient to
cover the amount of such deficiency. No failure on the part of the Buyer to
deliver a notice as specified in the immediately preceding sentence shall
relieve the Seller or Mr. Milstein of the obligation to pay the amount of such
deficiency to the Buyer. In the event the amount of funds in the Adjustment
Escrow Fund exceeds the Net Adjustment Amount, then the Escrow Agent, after
paying the Net Adjustment Amount to the Buyer as provided herein, shall pay
the remaining funds in the Adjustment Escrow Fund to the Seller.

 

(g) Amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.4(f) shall bear interest from the
Closing Date to the date of such payment at a rate equal to the rate of
interest from time to time announced publicly by Citibank, N.A. as its prime
rate, calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the number of days
elapsed. Payments in respect of Section 2.4(f) shall be made within three (3)
Business Days of final determination of the Net Adjustment Amount pursuant to
the provisions of this Section 2.4 by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such account or accounts as may be designated in writing by the
party entitled to such payment at least two (2) Business Days prior to such
payment date.

Section 2.5 _Tax Treatment of Equity Purchase_. The Buyer and the Seller
hereby agree that, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the purchase and sale
of the Membership Interests shall be treated as a purchase and sale of the
assets of the Company in exchange for the consideration described in this
Article II (and any adjustments thereto and assumed liabilities as determined
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) (the " _Tax Consideration_ "). The
Buyer, the Seller and the Company (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries)
further agree that the principles of Section 2.5 and Section 2.6 of this
Agreement shall apply to any jurisdiction which requires or permits (whether
by election or otherwise) the purchase and sale of the Membership
Interests to be treated as a purchase and sale of the assets of the Company.
No party shall take (and each party shall cause its Affiliates not to take) a
position on any Tax Return, before any Governmental Authority, or in any
judicial proceeding that is inconsistent with the tax treatment described in
this Section 2.5, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

Section 2.6  _Purchase Price Allocation_. __

(a) As soon as reasonably practical (but in any event within one hundred and
eighty (180) days) after the Closing and prior to the filing of any Tax
Return which includes information related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Buyer shall provide to the Seller the allocation of the amount
of the Tax Consideration among the assets of the Company (" _Purchase Price
Allocation_ ")for the Sellers review and consent. The Purchase Price
Allocation shall become final and binding on the thirtieth (30th) day
following the Buyers delivery thereof, unless prior to such period, the
Seller delivers to the Buyer a Notice of Disagreement specifying the nature of
any dispute as to the Purchase Price Allocation. During the thirty (30)-day
period following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement by the Seller to the
Buyer, the parties in good faith shall seek to resolve in writing any
differences that they may 

 



18  have with respect to the Purchase Price Allocation. If the Seller and the
Buyer have not resolved all differences by the end of such thirty
(30)-day period, the Seller and the Buyer shall submit, in writing, to the
Independent Accounting Firm, their briefs detailing their views as to the
correct nature and amount of the Purchase Price Allocation, and the
Independent Accounting Firm shall make a written determination (it being
understood that, in making such determination, the Independent Accounting Firm
will function as an expert and not as an arbitrator) as to the Purchase Price
Allocation, which determination shall be final and binding on the parties for
all purposes hereunder and shall not be subject to appeal or further review.
The Seller and the Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render a written decision
resolving the matters submitted to it as promptly as practicable, and in any
event within thirty (30) days following the submission thereof. Judgment may
be entered upon the written determination of the Independent Accounting Firm
in accordance with Section 10.9. In acting under this Agreement, the
Independent Accounting Firm will be entitled to the powers, privileges and
immunities of an arbitrator.

 

(b) The Purchase Price Allocation shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, all Tax Returns
filed by the Seller, the Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation. In the
event of an adjustment to the Tax Consideration, the Seller and the Buyer
agree to adjust the Purchase Price Allocation in a reasonable manner to
reflect such adjustment.

 

Section 2.7 _Withholding Rights_. The Buyer and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
they are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment or to otherwise take such action to satisfy any other Tax withholding
and reporting obligations with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and any such party shall pay over to or deposit such amounts with the
relevant Governmental Authority in a timely manner as required by applicable
Law. To the extent that such amounts are so withheld and paid over to or
deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority in a timely manner by the
Buyer or the Company, such withheld and paid amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(i) the most recent trust or other funding arrangement; (ii) the most recent
summary plan description and summary of material modifications thereof; (iii)
the two most recently filed Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form 5500;
(iv) the most recently received IRS determination letter for each such Plan
and the application materials submitted in connection with such determination
letter; and (v) the most recently prepared actuarial report and financial
statement in connection with each such Plan. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any express or implied commitment (A) to create, incur
liability with respect to or cause to exist any other employee benefit plan,
program or arrangement; (B) to enter into any Contract to provide compensation
or benefits to any individual; or (C) to modify, change or terminate any
Plan, other than with respect to a modification, change or termination
required by applicable Law, or a Plan or Contract in existence on the date
hereof.

 

(c) None of the Plans referred to in Section 3.12(a) is a multiemployer plan
within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "
_Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a single employer pension plan within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA for which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates could incur liability under Section 4063 or
4064 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ ") and no such Plan is subject to
Title IV of ERISA. None of such Plans: (i) provides for the payment of
separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits to any person;
(ii) obligates the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay separation,
severance, termination or similar-type benefits solely or partially as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements; or (iii) obligates the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any payment or provide any benefit as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. None
of such Plans provides for or promises retiree medical, disability or life
insurance benefits to any current or former employee, officer, director or
other service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
as required under Section 4980B of the Code or other applicable Law). Each of
the Plans is maintained in the United States and is subject only to the Laws
of the United States or a political subdivision thereof.

 

(d) Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws,
including ERISA and the Code. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by
it and is not in any material respect in default under or in violation under
any Plan, nor does the Seller or the Company have any knowledge of any such
default or violation by any other party to any Plan. No Action is pending or,
to the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, threatened with respect to any
Plan, other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course, and, to the
knowledge of the Seller and the Company, no fact or event exists that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Action.

 

(e) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code or Section 401(k) of the Code is so qualified and has received a timely
favorable determination, opinion or advisory letter from the IRS, covering all
of the provisions applicable to the Plan for which determination, opinion or
advisory letters are currently available, that the Plan is so qualified. Each
trust established in connection with any Plan which is intended to be exempt

 



26  from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code is so exempt
and has received a determination, opinion or advisory letter from the IRS that
it is so exempt. To the Knowledge of the Seller and the Company, no fact or
event has occurred since the date of such determination, opinion or advisory
letter or letters from the IRS that could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the qualified status of any such Plan or the exempt status of any such
trust.

(f) There has not been any prohibited transaction, within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, with respect to any Plan.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability
under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA, including any
liability in connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any
employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or (ii) the withdrawal from
any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and, to the knowledge of the
Seller and the Company, no fact or event exists that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such Action.

(g) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any Plan have been made or otherwise properly accrued on the books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries on or before their due dates. All
such contributions have been fully deducted for income tax purposes. No such
deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Authority and
no fact or event exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
such challenge or disallowance.

 

(h) There are no Actions or claims (other than routine claims for benefits)
pending or, to the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, threatened to be
asserted with respect to any Plan or any related trust or other funding medium
thereunder or with respect to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate as the
sponsor or fiduciary thereof or with respect to any other fiduciary thereof
and no Plan or any related or other funding medium thereunder or any
fiduciary thereof is, to the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, the
subject of an audit, investigation or examination by any Governmental
Authority.

 

(i) No "reportable event," as such term is used in Section 4043 of ERISA,
"accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is used in Sections 412 or
4971 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, or application for or receipt of a
waiver from the IRS of any minimum funding requirement under Section 412 of
the Code has occurred with respect to any Plan.

 

(j) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates do not maintain any Plan which is a
"group health plan," as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the
Code, that has not been administered and operated in all material respects in
compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 601 of ERISA, Section
4980B(b) of the Code and the applicable provisions of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1986. The Company is not subject to any
liability, including additional contributions, fines, penalties or loss of tax
deduction as a result of such administration and operation.

 

(k) The Company is not obligated to make any payments in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination
with any other event), including under any Plan, that reasonably could be
expected to be "excess parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the
Code, and there is no agreement, plan or other arrangement to which
the Company is a party or by which any of them is otherwise bound to
compensate any person in respect of taxes or other penalties pursuant to
Section 409A or 4999 of the Code,

 



27 Section 3.13 _Labor and Employment Matters_.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any labor,
works council, employee representative, collective bargaining, or other
Contract that pertains collectively to any group or segment of the employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no, and during the past
three (3) years have been no, organizing activities, demands for recognition,
or questions concerning representation initiated by any labor organization or
other collective bargaining activity that could affect the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pending or under discussion with any labor organization or
group of employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise subject to any
neutrality, labor peace, card-check or other obligation dictating or otherwise
limiting the manner in which it will respond to organizing efforts or any
request for recognition by any labor union or organization. There is no, and
during the past three (3) years there has been no, labor dispute, strike,
picketing, concerted job action, slowdown, work stoppage or lockout pending,
and to the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, none of the foregoing is
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has breached or otherwise failed to comply with
the provisions of any collective bargaining or union Contract. There are no
pending or, to the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, threatened union
grievances, demands for arbitration, or legal proceedings or administrative
charges alleging breach of collectively bargained labor obligations or
violation of any applicable labor law involving employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) The Company is and during the past three (3) years has been in compliance
in all material respects with all applicable Laws respecting employment,
including discrimination or harassment in employment, terms and conditions of
employment, termination of employment, wages, overtime classification, hours,
employee whistle-blowing, immigration, employee privacy, employment practices
and classification of employees, consultants and independent contractors. Each
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries has been accurately and correctly
classified for purpose of overtime eligibility and has been compensated in
a manner consistent with such classification. Workers engaged by the Company
or its Subsidiaries as non-employee temporary contract or independent workers
have been accurately and correctly classified with regard to their non-
employee status and have been engaged and compensated in a manner consistent
with the classification. The Company is not engaged in any unfair labor
practice, as defined in the National Labor Relations Act or other applicable
Laws. No charge, complaint, or other administrative proceeding is pending or,
to the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, threatened with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations Board,
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the United States Department of
Labor or any other Governmental Authority.

 

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have withheld and paid to the
appropriate Governmental Authority or are holding for payment not yet due to
such Governmental Authority all amounts required to be withheld from employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and are not liable for any taxes,
penalties or other sums for failure to 

 



28  comply with any applicable Laws relating to the employment of labor. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries have paid in full to all their respective
employees or adequately accrued in accordance with GAAP for all wages,
salaries, commissions, bonuses, benefits and other compensation due to such
employees.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to affirmative
action or other employment-related obligations by virtue of status as a
contractor to the federal or any state or local government or as a result of
any consent decree, settlement agreement, or court order to which it is a
party. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
executive officers has received within the past three (3) years any notice of
intent by any Governmental Authority responsible for the enforcement of labor
or employment laws to conduct an investigation relating to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, no
such investigation is in progress.

 

(e) As of the date hereof, no current officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has delivered written notice that he intends to terminate his
employment relationship with such entity following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) All employees hired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or after
November 7, 1986 are authorized for employment by the Company or such
Subsidiary in the United States in accordance with the Immigration and
Naturalization Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
During the past three (3) years, no allegations of immigration-related unfair
employment practices have been made with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or the Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment
Practices. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has completed and retained
in accordance with the Immigration and Naturalization Service regulations a
Form I-9 for all employees working in the United States hired on or after
November 7, 1986, except those employees whose employment terminated on or
before June 1, 1987. None of the employees currently employed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is authorized for employment in the United States
pursuant to a nonimmigrant visa that authorizes the employee to be employed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(g) During the past three (3) years, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has implemented any plant closing or layoff of employees that
implicated the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 (the
" _WARN Act_ "), or any similar state or local Law. During the period
commencing ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has effectuated reductions throughout its work
force which constitute "employment losses" (as that term is defined in the
WARN Act) of more than 20% of its work force.

 

Section 3.14 _Title to, Sufficiency and Condition of Assets_.

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and valid title to or a valid
leasehold or licensed interest in all of their assets, including all of the

accepted industry practice, are in all material respects in good operating
condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and are adequate for
the uses to which they are currently being put.

This Section 3.14 does not relate to real property or interests in real
property, such items being the subject of Section 3.15, or to Intellectual

as currently conducted. The Seller has delivered to the Buyer true, correct
and complete copies of each lease, sublease or license (and all amendments,
modifications or other agreements thereto) pursuant to which the Company or

governmental decree or order to be sold or to Companys knowledge as to the
Leased Real Property is being condemned, expropriated, re-zoned or otherwise
taken by any public authority with or without payment of compensation
therefore, nor,

 



30  to the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, has any such condemnation,
expropriation or taking been proposed or threatened. All leases, subleases
and/or licenses of Leased Real Property and all amendments and modifications
thereto are in full force and effect, and there exists no default under any
such lease by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the
Seller and the Company, any other party thereto, nor any event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default thereunder by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Seller and the
Company, any other party thereto. None of the Seller, the Company or
any Subsidiary have any current or future capital expenditure obligations
under any lease, sublease or license pursuant to which the Company or its
Subsidiaries occupies the Leased Real Property. All leases, subleases or
licenses of Leased Real Property shall remain valid and binding in accordance
with their terms following the Closing.

on the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property have been maintained in
all material respects in accordance with generally accepted industry practice,
are in all material respects in good operating condition and repair, ordinary
wear and tear excepted, and are adequate for the uses to which they are
currently being put. To the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, there are
no latent defects or adverse physical conditions affecting the Owned Real
Property or the Leased Real Property that materially and adversely affect the
Business.

pursuant to a written license agreement that remains in effect (" _Inbound
License Agreements_ "). To the actual knowledge of the Seller and the
Company, all Intellectual Property licensed to the Company and its
Subsidiaries under

 



31  the Inbound License Agreements is subsisting, valid and enforceable. All
milestones and other conditions set forth in any Inbound License Agreements
that are required to be satisfied in order for the Company and its

Agreements have been timely satisfied and all such rights remain in full force
and effect.

any and all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances), all right, title
and interest in the Company Intellectual Property, including all Intellectual
Property that was created or developed by employees, consultants or
contractors for the Company or such Subsidiary in the course of their
employment or engagement by the Company or such Subsidiary. No Intellectual
Property that is not owned by or licensed to the Company is necessary for the
conduct of the Business as conducted immediately prior to Closing. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or
claim challenging the Companys ownership of any of the Company Intellectual
Property, nor to the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, is there a
reasonable basis for any claim that the Company does not own any Company
Intellectual Property.

 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is bound by, nor is any
Company Intellectual Property subject to, any Contract containing any
covenant or other provision that in any way limits or restricts the ability of

of the Company Intellectual Property anywhere in the world. No Company
Intellectual Property has been subject to any disclaimers or voluntary
reduction in scope. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has

knowledge of the Seller and the Company, enforceable, and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or claim
challenging the validity or enforceability of any Company Registered IP or
alleging any misuse of such Company Registered IP. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take any action that
could reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment, cancellation,
forfeiture, relinquishment, invalidation or unenforceability of any of the
Company Registered IP currently used in the operation of the Business
(including the failure to pay any filing, examination, issuance, post
registration and maintenance fees, annuities and the like and the failure
to disclose any known material prior art in connection with the prosecution
of patent applications).

(j) To the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, none of the activities or
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the use of any
Intellectual Property in connection therewith) have infringed upon,
misappropriated, violated, diluted or used in an unauthorized manner, any
Intellectual Property of any third party, and neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or claim asserting or
suggesting that any such infringement, misappropriation, violation, dilution
or unauthorized use is or may be occurring or has or may have occurred, nor
to the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, is there a reasonable basis
therefor. No Intellectual Property owned by, or, to the actual knowledge of
the Seller and the Company, licensed to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding order, judgment, decree,
stipulation or agreement restricting the use thereof by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Seller and the Company, no
third party is misappropriating, infringing, diluting or violating any
Intellectual Property owned by or exclusively licensed to the Company or any

business, granted any license with respect to any Company Intellectual
Property. Upon the consummation of the Closing, (i) the Company and its
Subsidiaries will continue to own or have a license to all of the Intellectual

immediately prior to Closing and all of such rights shall be exercisable by
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the same extent as immediately prior to
the Closing, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries will have all rights to use
the Customer Database, and (iii) all rights to the Customer Database under
the Hard Rock Agreements shall be transferrable to the Buyer and to any
successor manager. To the actual knowledge of the Seller and the Company, no
loss or expiration of any of the material Intellectual Property used by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the conduct of the Business is
threatened, pending or reasonably foreseeable.

(l) The execution, delivery and performance by the Seller and the Company of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, will not give rise to any right of any third
party to (i), except for the termination rights set forth in the Hard Rock
Agreements, terminate or re-price or otherwise

 



33  modify any of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries rights or
obligations under any agreement under which any right or license of or under,

Section 3.17 _Taxes_. __

 

(a) At all times since its formation, the Seller was properly treated as a
partnership or disregarded entity (and not as an association taxable as a
corporation or as a publicly traded partnership) for U.S. federal and all
applicable state and local income tax purposes, and no election to the
contrary has been made. For purposes of the representations contained in
Sections 3.17(b) through (q), any reference to Seller shall include Sellers
regarded beneficial owner to the extent Seller is or was properly treated as a
disregarded entity during the relevant period of time.

 

(b) At all times since December 28, 2017, the Company is and has been properly
treated as an entity disregarded as separate from its sole owner, the Seller,
for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes, and no
election to the contrary has been made or will be made prior to or on the
Closing Date. At all times since formation until December 28, 2017,
the Company was properly treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income tax purposes, and no election to the
contrary was made. Since formation of each Subsidiary of the Company, each
Subsidiary has been properly treated as an entity disregarded as separate
from its sole owner for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax
purposes. _Schedule 3.17(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedules indicates since
formation the U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax
classification of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, including any
changes of such classification and the effective dates of any elections made
with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 301.7701-3.

and applicable state and local income tax purposes, all allocations and
distributions to the owners of the Company were made in accordance with the
limited liability company operating agreement of the Company, as amended.

 

(d) The Company and its Subsidiaries have timely filed all Tax Returns
required to be filed by them, all such Tax Returns are true, complete and

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries have timely paid all Taxes that have
become due and payable (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) and have made
adequate provisions in the Financial Statements in accordance with (to the

payable as of the dates thereof. All Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries accrued since the date of the Interim Financial Statements have
been accrued in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with past
practice of the Company and do not exceed comparable amounts incurred in
similar periods in prior years

 



34  (taking into account any changes in the Tax Laws and in Companys operating
results). The provisions for Taxes currently payable in the Interim Financial
Statements are at least equal, as of the date thereof, to all unpaid Taxes of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, whether or not disputed.

(f) True, correct and complete copies of all filed federal and state income
Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for taxable years commencing
on or after January 1, 2014, have been delivered or made available to Buyer.

properties; (ii) there is no presently pending audit examination, written
request for information, refund, claim, litigation, proceedings or proposed
adjustment with respect to Taxes of or with respect to the Seller, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) to the knowledge of the Seller and the
Company, no such audit, examination, request for information, claim,
litigation or proceeding is threatened. All deficiencies asserted or
assessments made against the Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective assets or properties as a result of any examinations
by any taxing authority have been fully paid.

properties of the Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than
Permitted Encumbrances or with respect to current Taxes not yet due and
payable.

limitation applicable to any claim for, or the period for the collection or
assessment of, Taxes with respect to the Seller, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or properties.

(j) No written claim or to the knowledge of the Seller, the Company, or its
Subsidiaries other claim, has been made by any taxing authority in any

or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

(aa) enter into any Contract, or otherwise make a commitment to do any of the

into prior to the date hereof; and (ii) the Seller may retain copies of any
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its
Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.3 _Exclusivity_. The Seller agrees that between the date of this
Agreement and the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this

(a) solicit, initiate, consider, encourage or accept any other proposals or
offers from any Person (i) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of all or any portion of the membership interests or other equity or
ownership interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than inventory to be sold in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or equipment that is
being retired or replaced; (ii) to enter into any merger, consolidation or
other business combination relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; or (iii) to enter into a recapitalization, reorganization or any

(b) participate in any discussions, conversations, negotiations or other
communications regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other Person to seek to
do any of the things set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_. The Seller
immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions,
conversations, negotiations and other communications with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.

The Seller shall notify the Buyer promptly, but in any event within 24 hours,
orally and in writing if any such proposal or offer, or any inquiry or other
contact with any Person with respect thereto, is made. Any such notice to the
Buyer shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the Person making
such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions
of such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact. The Seller shall not, and
shall cause the Company and each of its Subsidiaries not to, release any
Person from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which the Seller or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, without the prior written consent of the Buyer.

 



53 Section 5.4 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

(a) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing, the Seller and Mr.
Milstein shall not, directly or indirectly through any Affiliate, Person or
contractual arrangement:

(i) engage in the business of owning, operating or otherwise managing a land-
based VLT facility, casino or horse racing racetrack anywhere within a one
hundred and fifty (150) mile radius of the Business, or perform management,
executive or supervisory functions with respect to, own, operate, join,
control, render financial assistance to, receive any economic benefit from or
participate in, any business or Person that is engaged in whole or in part in
the business of owning, operating or otherwise managing a land-based VLT
facility, casino or horse racing racetrack;

(ii) solicit, recruit or hire any person who at any time on or after the
date of this Agreement is a Company Group Employee (as hereinafter defined);
_provided_ , that the foregoing shall not prohibit (A) a general solicitation
to the public of general advertising or similar methods of solicitation by
search firms not specifically directed at Company Group Employees or (B) the
Seller or any of its Affiliates from soliciting, recruiting or hiring any
Company Group Employee who has ceased to be employed or retained by the
Company, the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates for at least ninety
(90) days. For purposes of this Section 5.4, " _Company Group Employees_ "
means, collectively, officers, directors and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; or

 

(iii) disparage the Buyer or any of its Affiliates in any way that could
materially adversely affect the goodwill, reputation or
business relationships of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates with the public
generally, or with any of their customers, suppliers or employees.

 

(b) Each of the Seller and Mr. Milstein acknowledges that the covenants of the
Seller and Mr. Milstein set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ are an
essential element of this Agreement and that any breach by the Seller or Mr.
Milstein of any provision of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ may result in
irreparable injury to the Buyer. Each of the Seller and Mr. Milstein
acknowledges that in the event of such a breach, in addition to all other
remedies available at law, the Buyer shall be entitled to seek equitable
relief, including injunctive relief, and an equitable accounting of all
earnings, profits or other benefits arising therefrom, as well as such other
damages as may be appropriate. Each of the Seller and Mr. Milstein has
independently consulted with its counsel and after such consultation
agrees that the covenants set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ are
reasonable and proper to protect the legitimate interest of the Buyer.

 

(c) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the character,
duration or geographical scope of the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _
5.4_ are unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of the parties
that these provisions shall be construed by the court in such a manner as to
impose only those restrictions on the Sellers or Mr. Milsteins conduct that
are reasonable in light of the circumstances and as are necessary to assure to
the Buyer the benefits of this Agreement. If, in any judicial proceeding, a
court shall refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants of this _Section_
__ _ 5.4_ because taken together they are more extensive than necessary to
assure to the Buyer the intended benefits of this Agreement, it is expressly
understood and agreed by the parties that the provisions hereof that, if
eliminated, would permit the remaining separate provisions to be enforced in
such proceeding, shall be deemed eliminated, for the purposes of such
proceeding, from this Agreement.

 



54 Section 5.5 _Release of Indemnity Obligations_. The Seller and Mr. Milstein,
on or prior to the Closing, shall execute and deliver to the Company, for the
benefit of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, a general release and

secure its obligations or otherwise hold it harmless pursuant to any agreement
or other arrangement entered into prior to the Closing.

Section 5.6 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Except for the Warehouse Lease
Agreement dated August 12, 2014 between the Company and Trebmal Miles LLC,
all intercompany and intracompany accounts or contracts between the Company
and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Seller, Mr. Milstein and their
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other hand,
shall be cancelled without any consideration or further liability to any party
and without the need for any further documentation, immediately prior to the
Closing.

 

Section 5.7 _Resignations_. The Seller will deliver at the Closing the
resignation or removal of all of the managers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, effective as of the Closing, except for such managers that the
Buyer specifies in writing to the Seller prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.8 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) The parties hereto intend that there shall be continuity of employment
with respect to the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Business Employees_ ") following the
Closing.

(b) The Buyer has no present plan to implement any "mass layoff" or "plant
closing" as those terms are defined in the WARN Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, on and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall have responsibility
for providing all notices, pay, and benefits that may be required under the
WARN Act or Ohio Revenue Code § 4141.28(C) with regard to (i) any Business
Employees whose employment ends on or after the Closing Date, and (ii) any
individual for whom notice, pay, or benefits obligations arise under the
foregoing laws as the result of actions of the Buyer taken on or after the

(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) or any plan directly or indirectly
maintained or contributed to by the Buyer providing similar benefits to an
"employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), the
Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived any
pre-existing condition limitations or actively-at-work requirements and
similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements for each Business Employee under any Buyer Plans to the extent
waived or satisfied by a Business Employee under a comparable Plan as of the
Closing Date and (ii) cause any deductible, co-insurance or covered out-of-
pocket expenses paid in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs and
on or before the Closing Date by any Business Employee (or covered
dependent thereof) under a comparable Plan to be taken into account for
purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket provisions after the Closing Date under any applicable Buyer
Plan in the year of initial participation.

 



55 (d) Effective as of the Closing Date, Robert R. Burkhart and Mr. Milstein

requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I
of ERISA. Effective as of the Closing Date, each Prestige Employee as of the
Closing Date shall be entitled to receive a distribution of his or her account
balance under the Northfield Park Associates 401(k) Retirement Plan, if any,
on account of his or her severance from employment as a result of the

who entered into any such agreement or to whom Confidential Information was
provided in connection with a business combination involving the Company or
its Affiliates. From and after the Closing, the Seller will, at the Buyers
expense, take all actions reasonably requested by the Buyer in order to
assist in enforcing the rights so assigned. The Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such Person to return to the
Seller any documents, files, data or other materials constituting

Licenses and Rights and Section 5.14 with respect to the transfer of all

64 ARTICLE VI

 

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 6.1 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed, within the time and manner prescribed by Law, all Tax
Returns of such Company or Subsidiary (including any Tax Returns in respect of
its assets) that are required to be filed prior to the Closing Date
(each such Tax Return, a " _Pre-Closing Tax Return_"). All such Pre-Closing
Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice
unless otherwise required by applicable Law. The Seller shall prepare and
file or cause to be prepared and filed, within the time and manner prescribed
by applicable Law, all Flow-Through Income Tax Returns required to be filed by
or on behalf of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (all such Tax Returns, " _Pre-Closing Flow-Through
Income Tax Returns_"). All such Pre-Closing Flow-Through Income Tax Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice unless otherwise
required by applicable Law and this Agreement. The Buyer shall prepare and
file or cause to be prepared and filed all Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are required to be filed
after the Closing Date, other than Pre-Closing Flow-Through Income Tax Returns
(" _Post-Closing Tax Returns_ "). All such Post-Closing Tax Returns shall be
prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past practice unless required
by applicable Law. Such Post-Closing Tax Returns shall be submitted to the
Seller, together with a schedule setting forth in reasonable detail the
portion of Taxes due in connection with such Post-Closing Tax Return that is
the responsibility of the Seller hereunder, no later than thirty (30) days
prior to the due date for filing thereof (including applicable extensions) for
the Sellers review and consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. To the extent not included in the
determination of Net Working Capital, the Seller shall remit the Sellers
share of Taxes due in respect of such Post-Closing Tax Returns to the Buyer no
later than ten (10) days before the due date for such Taxes. The Seller and
the Buyer agree to consult and resolve in good faith any disputes arising as a
result of the review of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 6.1; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Buyer and the Seller are unable to resolve any
disputed item, then such disputed item shall be resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm. The costs and expenses of any dispute resolution by the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Seller and the Buyer in
inverse proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the
Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be
calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the
amounts in dispute.

 

Section 6.2 _Tax Claims_. If a claim for Seller Taxes, including notice of a
pending or threatened audit by any taxing authority, shall be made in writing
against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Buyer, which, if
successful, would result in an indemnity payment pursuant to Section 8.2 of
this Agreement (a " _Tax Claim_ "), the Buyer shall notify the Seller of the
Tax Claim within ten (10) days following the Buyers or the Companys or
relevant Subsidiarys receipt of the written claim for Taxes; provided that
any failure to notify the Seller shall not impact the indemnification
obligations of the Seller pursuant to this Agreement, unless the Seller is
actually and materially prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall state
the nature and basis of the Tax Claim and the amount thereof, each to the
extent known by the Buyer or the Company. The Seller shall have the sole
right to represent the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to any such Tax Claim that relates wholly to a pre-closing tax period

 



65  and does not include any portion of a Straddle Period (subject to Buyers
right to participate) (a " _Seller Only Tax Claim_ "); provided that the
Seller shall not make any election or take any action to cause the Buyer, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to be liable for payment of
any portion or all of such Seller Only Tax Claim (including pursuant to the
Partnership Audit Rules) and the Seller shall not settle or resolve such
Seller Only Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the Buyer (such
consent not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and provided
further, that the parties agree it would be unreasonable for the Buyer to
withhold consent if the resolution or settlement of such Seller Only Tax Claim
could not have an adverse effect on the Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in respect of a Post-Closing Tax Period (including a
Straddle Period). The Buyer shall have the right to employ counsel of its
choice at its expense in connection with such Seller Only Tax Claim and to
participate in any related audit or proceeding and the Buyer shall not enter
into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect to such Seller Only Tax Claim. Buyer shall have the sole right to
represent the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Tax Claim
other than a Seller Only Tax Claim, but the Buyer shall not settle or resolve
such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the Seller (such consent
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and provided further,
that the parties agree it would be unreasonable for the Seller to withhold
consent if the resolution or settlement of such Tax Claim could not result in
any liability or obligation of the Seller or Mr. Milstein. The Seller shall
have the right to employ counsel of its choice at its expense in connection
with such Tax Claim and to participate in any related audit or proceeding.

Section 6.3 _Allocation of Taxe_ _s_. For purposes of this Agreement, the
determination of the Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending prior
to, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning on, the Closing Date
shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two
taxable periods, one that ended on the day prior to the Closing Date and the
other that began on the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction,
loss or credit and state and local apportionment factors of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two
taxable periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries were closed at the closing on
the Closing Date; provided, however, that (a) exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as depreciation; and
(b) periodic Taxes, such as property or similar ad valorem Taxes, shall, in
each case, be apportioned ratably between such periods on the basis of the
number of days elapsed in each such period.

Section 6.4 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be paid
one-half by the Seller and one-half by the Buyer, and all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes shall
be prepared and filed by the party required by Law to file such Tax Returns at
such partys expense. Each party shall provide the other party with copies of
all Tax Returns and other documentation for Transfer Taxes and evidence that
such Transfer Taxes have been paid. The parties shall cooperate in connection
with the filing of any such Tax Returns for Transfer Taxes, including joining
in the execution of such Tax Returns.

Section 6.5 _Tax Cooperatio_ _n_. The Seller and the Buyer agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to the other party, upon request, as
promptly as practical, such information, records and assistance (including,
without limitation, making such of their respective officers, directors, 

 



66  employees and agents available as may reasonably be requested by such other
party) in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, audit or other
proceeding that relates to the Company; provided, that in no event shall any
party or any of its respective Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) be required to provide access to or copies of any income Tax
Returns of such party or any such Affiliate. Any reasonable out-of-pocket
expense incurred in providing such information or assistance shall be borne by
the party requesting it.

 

Section 6.6 _Section 754 Election_. The Company will make an election under

Tax Return form for 2017.

terms contemplate performance in whole or in part after the Closing shall
survive the Closing until the expiration of the statute of
limitations following the date all performance thereunder was due to be

(c) Neither the Seller nor the Buyer shall have any liability with respect to
any breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements unless
written notice of that claim hereunder is given to the other party prior to
the expiration of the survival period, if any, for such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, in which case such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement shall survive solely as to such claim until such claim
has been finally resolved, without the requirement of commencing any Action in
order to extend such survival period or preserve such claim.

Section 8.2 _Indemnification by the Seller_ _and Mr._ __ _ Milstein_. The
Seller and Mr. Milstein shall jointly and severally save, defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) and its and their Representatives,
successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ")
from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse each of the foregoing
for, any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest,
awards, judgments, penalties, costs and

 



70  expenses (including attorneys fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing, but
excluding any punitive damages and diminution in value, in each case, unless
payable to a third party) (hereinafter collectively, " _Losses_ "), asserted
against, incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties as a result of, arising out of or relating to:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the

(e) Fraud.

Section 8.3  _Indemnification by the Buyer_. The Buyer and MGP shall jointly
and severally save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against, and shall compensate and reimburse each of the foregoing for, any and
all Losses asserted against, incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the
foregoing as a result of, arising out of or relating to:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the
Buyer contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement; and

(b) any breach of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement by the Buyer
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

Section 8.4 _Procedures_.

 

(a) In order for a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a Loss or a
claim or demand made by any third party against the Indemnified Party (a "
_Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall deliver written notice
(a " _Claim Notice_ ") in respect thereof to the party against whom indemnity
is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") promptly (and in no event later than
thirty (30) days) after such Indemnified Party becomes aware of the Third
Party Claim describing in reasonable detail, to the extent known, (i) the
facts giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder; (ii) the amount
or method of computation of the amount of such claim (reasonably estimated in
good faith to the extent feasible); and (iii) the nature of the breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to which such
Indemnified Party claims to be entitled to indemnification hereunder, and
shall provide any other information with respect thereto as the

 



71  Indemnifying Party may reasonably request and which is reasonably available
to the Indemnified Party. The failure to deliver a Claim Notice, however,
shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under
this Article VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by such failure.

(b) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim by retaining counsel of its
choice, reasonably acceptable to the relevant Indemnified Parties, to
represent such Indemnified Parties in connection with such Third Party Claim
and will pay the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense (and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole
control over the defense) of a Third Party Claim if: (i) such Third Party
Claim involves an amount in dispute less than the Basket, (ii) involves
criminal allegations, (iii) such Third Party Claim seeks injunctive or other
equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (iv) the Indemnified Party has
been advised by counsel that an actual conflict of interest exists between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, (v) the Indemnified Party
reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to such Third Party
Claim would reasonably be expected to materially injure the Indemnified
Partys reputation, relationship with its current business partners or future
business prospects, (vi) the Losses relating to such Third Party Claim
together with all other indemnification claims previously made would
reasonably be expected to exceed the maximum amount for which the Indemnifying
Party would be liable under this Article VIII, taking into account the
limitations on indemnification herein, or (vii) the claim relates to Taxes
(other than Seller Taxes). The Indemnifying Party shall notify the relevant
Indemnified Parties of its election to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim as soon as reasonably practicable (and in no event later than thirty
(30) days after receipt of the applicable Claim Notice). If the Indemnifying
Party has not elected to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim
pursuant to the prior sentence, the Indemnified Party may assume such defense.
If the Indemnifying Party so elects to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Parties may participate, at their own expense
and through legal counsel of their choice, in any such Action, provided that
(i) the Indemnifying Party may continue to control the defense of the
Indemnified Parties in connection with such Action and (ii) the Indemnified
Parties and their counsel will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying
Partys counsel in connection with such Action. If the Indemnifying Party has
elected to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
will have the right to settle, compromise or discharge such Third Party Claim
either (x) with the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnified Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or
(y) without any Indemnified Partys consent if such settlement, compromise or
discharge provides for no relief other than the payment of monetary damages
(including monetary fines or penalties) and such monetary damages are paid in
full by the Indemnifying Party, requires no admission of liability by any
Indemnified Party and contains a release of the Indemnified Parties from any
liabilities arising out of such Third Party Claim. Under no circumstances will
the Indemnifying Party have any liability in connection with any settlement
of any Third Party Claim that is entered into without its prior written
consent (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) An Indemnified Party seeking indemnification in respect of, arising out of
or involving a Loss or a claim or demand hereunder that does not involve a
Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party (a " _Direct Claim_ ")

 



72  shall deliver a Claim Notice in respect thereof to the Indemnifying Party
with reasonable promptness (and in no event later than thirty (30) days) after
becoming aware of facts supporting such Direct Claim, and shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to deliver a Claim
Notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party does
not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days following
its receipt of a Claim Notice in respect of a Direct Claim that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder,
such Direct Claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such Claim Notice
shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder
and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the
Indemnified Party on demand. If the Indemnifying Party agrees that it has an
indemnification obligation but asserts that it is obligated to pay a lesser
amount than that claimed by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
shall pay such lesser amount promptly to the Indemnified Party, without
prejudice to or waiver of the Indemnified Partys claim for the difference.

(d) The indemnification required hereunder shall be made by prompt payment by
the Escrow Agent (to the extent of any amounts then held in the Retention
Escrow Fund if applicable) or the Indemnifying Party (to the extent of any
amounts not then held in the Retention Escrow Fund if applicable) of the
amount of actual Losses in connection therewith, as and when bills
are received by the Indemnifying Party or Losses incurred have been notified
to the Indemnifying Party.

(e) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to require that any action
be made or brought against any other Person before action is brought or claim
is made against it hereunder by the Indemnified Party.

 

Section 8.5 _Limits on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement:

 

(i) other than with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental
Representation (with the exception of the representations set forth in
Section 3.12 (Employee Benefits) and 3.17 (Taxes)) or in instances of Fraud,
the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered by
the Buyer Indemnified Parties against the Seller or Mr. Milstein pursuant
to Section 8.2(a) and Section 8.2(d) shall be an amount equal to the amount
deposited into the Retention Escrow Fund and any interest earned thereon;

 

(ii) other than with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental
Representation (with the exception of the representations set forth in
Section 3.12 (Employee Benefits) and 3.17 (Taxes)) or in instances of Fraud,
the Seller and Mr. Milstein shall not be liable for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or Section 8.2(d), as the case
may be, unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which
may be recovered from the Seller and Mr. Milstein equals or exceeds $5,312,500
(the " _Basket_ "), in which case the Seller and Mr. Milstein shall only
be liable for the Losses in excess of such amount and up to the maximum
amounts otherwise set forth in this Section 8.5;

 



73 (iii) the Seller and Mr. Milstein shall not be obligated to indemnify any
Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss to the extent that a
specific accrual or reserve for the amount of such Loss was taken into account
in calculating the Net Adjustment Amount; and

 

(iv) without limiting clause (i) above, other than in instances of Fraud, in
no event shall the aggregate indemnification obligations of the Seller and
Mr. Milstein under Section 8.2 exceed the Enterprise Value.

(b) Other than with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of any Fundamental
Representation (with the exception of the representations set forth in Section
3.12 (Employee Benefits) and 3.17 (Taxes)) or in instances of Fraud, with
respect to Losses that may be recovered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
against the Seller or Mr. Milstein pursuant to Section 8.2(a) and Section
8.2(d), such Losses shall be satisfied from (i) first, the Retention Escrow
Fund to the extent of the amount then held in the Retention Escrow Fund; and
(ii) second, the RandW Insurance Policy.

(c) For purposes of the (i) determination of whether there has been an
inaccuracy in or breach of a representation or warranty in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or
thereto or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;
and (ii) the calculation of any Losses arising out of any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty shall each be determined without
regard to any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or other similar
qualification contained in such representation or warranty.

(d) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article VIII will be reduced by (i) any amounts that are actually recovered
(net of reasonable out-of-pocket costs of collection) by the Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates from any third party with respect to such Losses and
(ii) any insurance proceeds (net of reasonable out-of-pocket costs of
collection, any deductible or self-insured retention amount) or other cash
receipts or source of reimbursement that are actually received by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates with respect to such Losses;
provided that clause (ii) shall in no event reduce the amount of any
Losses recoverable under the RandW Insurance Policy. With respect to any Losses
arising from a breach by Hard Rock under the Hard Rock Agreements for which
Hard Rock is required to indemnify the Company, the Buyer shall use
commercially reasonably efforts to recover such Losses from Hard Rock while
seeking recovery from the Seller or Mr. Milstein. If any amount to be reduced
under this Section 8.5 from any payment required under this Article VIII is
determined after the date on which the Indemnifying Party is required
pursuant to this Article VIII to pay such indemnification claim, the
Indemnified Party will promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party any amount
that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to pay pursuant to this
Article VIII had such determination been made at the time of such
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party.

 

Section 8.6 _Remedies Not Affected by Investigation, Disclosure or Knowledge_.
If the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Buyer expressly
reserves the right to seek indemnity or other remedy in accordance with this
Agreement for any Losses arising out of or relating to any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein,

 



74  notwithstanding any investigation by, disclosure to, knowledge or imputed
knowledge of the Buyer or any of its Representatives in respect of any fact or
circumstance that reveals the occurrence of any such breach, whether before
or after the execution and delivery hereof. In furtherance of the foregoing,
except, in each case, in connection with any allegation of Fraud, each of the
Seller and Mr. Milstein agrees that as knowledge or lack of reliance shall
not be a defense in law or equity to any claim of breach of representation,
warranty or covenant by the Seller and Mr. Milstein herein, the Seller and Mr.
Milstein shall not in any proceeding concerning a breach or alleged breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant herein, or any indemnity thereof,
seek information concerning knowledge or reliance of the Buyer or any of its
Representatives, through deposition, discovery or otherwise or seek
to introduce evidence or argument in any proceeding regarding the knowledge
or lack of reliance of the Buyer or any of its Representatives prior to the
Closing on or with respect to any such representations, warranties or
covenants.

 

Section 8.7 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. To the extent permitted
by Law, any amounts payable pursuant to this Article VIII shall be considered
adjustments to the Tax Consideration for all income Tax purposes and the
parties and their respective Affiliates agree to take no position inconsistent
with such treatment in any Tax Return or Action before any
Governmental Authority.

Section 8.8 _Exclusive Remedy_. Other than (a) the rights of the parties
hereto pursuant to Section 2.4 and Article VI and (b) claims arising from
Fraud this Article VIII will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Indemnified Parties from and after the Closing Date for any claims based upon
a breach or alleged breach of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing
will not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to seek specific
performance or injunctive relief against any party.

 

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION 

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Seller;

 

(b) (i) by the Seller, if the Seller is not then in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement and the Buyer breaches or fails to perform
in any respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained
in this Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, (B) cannot be cured or
has not been cured within thirty (30) days following delivery to the Buyer of
written notice of such breach or failure to perform and (C) has not been
waived by the Seller; or (ii) by the Buyer, if the Buyer is not then in
material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and the Seller

warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement and such breach or failure
to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.3; (B) cannot be cured or has not been cured within thirty (30) days
following delivery to the Seller of written notice of such breach or failure
to perform; and (C) has not been waived by the Buyer;

 



75 (c) (i) by the Seller, if any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1
or Section 7.2 shall have become incapable of fulfillment prior to the date
that is six (6) months from the date of this Agreement (the " _Termination
Date_ ") or (ii) by the Buyer, if any of the conditions set forth in Section
7.1 or Section 7.3 shall have become incapable of fulfillment prior to the
Termination Date; provided, however, that the Termination Date shall be
automatically extended for up to two periods of ninety (90) days each (and
the "Termination Date" shall automatically become the last day of such ninety
(90)-day period) if, on the then applicable Termination Date:

 

(i) any of the Required Approvals required in Section 7.1(b) for the closing
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by such date has not been
obtained; and

Section 10.18 _Conflict of Interest_. If the Seller so desires, without the

Baker and Hostetler LLP (" _Baker_ ") shall be permitted to represent the Seller
and Mr. Milstein after the Closing in connection with any matter, including
anything related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any
other agreements referenced herein and any disagreement and dispute relating
thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing,
Baker shall be permitted to represent the Seller, any of its Affiliates, and
any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation, transaction or
dispute (including any litigation, arbitration or other adversary proceeding)
with the Buyer, the Company or any of their agents or Affiliates under
or relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
and any related matter, such as claims or disputes arising under other
agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement, including with
respect to any indemnification claims. As to all communications among Baker,
the Company, the Seller and any of their respective Affiliates that relate
solely to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Seller and
may be controlled by the Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by the
Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates after the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent that Baker has
represented the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any Action unrelated to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, as to all
communications between Baker and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
attendant attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection, and
expectation of client confidentiality applicable thereto belongs to the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Upon and after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall cease to have any attorney-client relationship with Baker,
unless and to the extent Baker is specifically engaged in writing by the
Company to represent the Company after the Closing and either such engagement
involves no conflict of interest with respect to the Seller or the Seller
consents in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such representation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by Baker after the Closing shall not
affect the foregoing provisions hereof.

 



81 Section 10.19 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties agrees that this
Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable
pursuant to its terms and that the Buyer and the Seller would be irreparably
harmed if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their terms and that monetary damages would not provide
adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedy to
which a non-breaching party may be entitled at law, a non-breaching party
shall be entitled to injunctive relief without the posting of any bond or
other security to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions hereof, and the breaching party waives the
defense that an adequate remedy at law may exist. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, neither MGP nor any subsidiary or affiliate thereof,
other than the Buyer, shall be required to acquire the Membership Interests
or any other interests in the Business or its assets.
