 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, the Purchaser and the Company hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
  _THE OFFER AND THE MERGER_  

   

 Section 1.1 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within seven (7) Business Days) after the date hereof, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), the Offer to purchase all the outstanding Shares at the Offer Price, subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of Shares which, together with the number of Shares (if any) then owned of record by Parent or the Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or the Purchaser otherwise has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power, represents at least a majority of the Shares outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) at the Expiration Date (the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or the Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex A. 

  

 (b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or the Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex A, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable after the Purchaser is legally permitted to do so under applicable Law. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with Section 2.2(c). In circumstances in which the stockholders of the Company do not have the right to seek remedies at law or equity, the obligations of Parent and the Purchaser under this Agreement are material to the Companys execution of this Agreement and any failure by Parent or the Purchaser to comply with the terms of this Agreement shall enable the Company to seek all remedies available at law or equity to it and on behalf of the stockholders. 

  

 (c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex A. Parent and the Purchaser expressly reserve the right, at any time, in their sole discretion, to waive, in whole or in part, any condition to the Offer or other requirement set forth in Annex A or increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided, however_ , that unless previously approved by the Company in writing, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (v) amend any of the other conditions and requirements to the Offer set forth in Annex A in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares, or (vi) extend the Expiration Date in a manner other than in accordance with this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the date on which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement (the " _Expiration Date_ "). 

  

 (e) If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, all of the conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex A) have not been satisfied, or waived by Parent or the Purchaser, the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, without the consent of the Company cause the Purchaser to extend the Offer for successive periods of up to twenty (20) Business Days each, the length of each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion, in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions. The Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or its staff. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Purchaser agree that if on any scheduled Expiration Date, either the Minimum Condition or the HSR Condition (as such term is defined in Annex A), is not satisfied but all of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex A are satisfied or, in Parents and the Purchasers sole discretion, waived, then the Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, extend the Offer for up to forty (40) Business Days in the aggregate, the length of such period to be determined by the Company in its sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall not require the Purchaser to extend the Offer more than twice and the Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer (i) beyond August 15, 2009 (the " _Outside Date_ "), or (ii) at any time that Parent and the Purchaser have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VII. 

  

 (f) If necessary to obtain sufficient Shares (without regard to Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option or Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee) to reach the Short Form Threshold, the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, cause the Purchaser to provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of up to twenty (20) Business Days. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) immediately accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering period". The Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of a "subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this Section 1.1(f). 

  

 (g) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by the Purchaser, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, the Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of the Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. 

   ##### 

   

  

 (h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer, Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act.

entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, on the Board of Directors as is equal to the product of
the total number of directors on the Board of Directors (giving effect to the
directors elected or designated by Parent pursuant to this
sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares
beneficially owned by Parent, the Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding. After the

   ##### 

   

    

remaining Continuing Director or Continuing Directors shall be entitled to
elect or designate another Person who satisfies the foregoing independence
requirements to fill such vacancy, and such Person shall be deemed to be a
Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement. After Parents designees
are elected or designated to, and constitute a majority of, the Board of
Directors pursuant to Section 1.3(a), and prior to the Effective Time, in
addition to any approvals of the Board of Directors or the stockholders of
the Company as may be required by the Company Charter, the By-laws or

hereunder, (v) exercise or waiver of the Companys rights or remedies
hereunder, (vi) amendment to the Company Charter or the By-laws, (vii)

contemplated hereby may, in each case, be effected only if there are in
office one (1) or more Continuing Directors and such action is approved by a
majority of the Continuing Directors then in office; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall designate, prior to the Acceptance Time, two (2)
alternate Continuing Directors that the Board of Directors shall appoint in
the event of the death, disability or resignation of the Continuing
Directors, each of whom shall, following such appointment to the Board of
Directors, be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this
Agreement. The Continuing Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the
Continuing Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which
may include current counsel to the Company or the Board of Directors) and
other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing
Directors, and the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company
to enforce performance of this Agreement.

 (b) The obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (i) no provision of any applicable law and no Order shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise, (ii) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares held of record by Parent and the Purchaser constitutes at least one (1) Share more than ninety percent (90%) of the number of Shares that shall be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares, and (iii) the Purchaser has accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable legal requirements of all Governmental Entities, including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act. 

  

 (c) To exercise the Top-Up Option, the Purchaser shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ") specifying (i) the number of Shares that shall be held of record by Parent and the Purchaser immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up 

   ##### 

  

    

Shares and (ii) the place, time and date for the closing of the purchase and
sale of the Top-Up Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall,
promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written
notice to the Purchaser confirming the number of Top-Up Shares and the
aggregate purchase price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At
the Top-Up Closing, the Purchaser shall pay the Company, in the manner set
forth in Section 1.7(d) hereof, the aggregate price required to be paid for
the Top-Up Shares, in an aggregate principal amount equal to that specified
in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be issued and
delivered to the Purchaser a certificate or certificates representing the Top-
Up Shares or, at the Purchasers request or otherwise if the Company does not
then have certificated Shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares.
Such certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends that are
required by applicable Law. 

  

 (d) The Purchaser may pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares either (i) entirely in cash or (ii) at the Purchasers election, by (x) paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares and (y) executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (x) (a " _Promissory Note_ "). Any such Promissory Note shall be full recourse against Parent and the Purchaser and (i) shall bear interest at the rate of 3% per annum, (ii) shall mature on the first (1st) anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such Promissory Note and (iii) may be prepaid, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. 

  

 (e) Parent and the Purchaser acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares which the Purchaser may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be registered under the Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and the Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that the Purchaser is, or shall be upon any purchase of Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. The Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by the Purchaser for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder in cash, without interest,

 (ii) All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2. 

  

 (b) _Parent, Purchaser and Company-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, or held by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf of third parties or Shares held in trust to fund Company obligations) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of the Purchaser shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. 

  

 (d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Any Person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall not be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Persons right to dissent from the Merger under the DGCL.

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. 

  

 (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent (and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably determine prior to the Effective Time) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the applicable Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 (c) _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Purchaser and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the relevant Offer Price or Merger Consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other provision of Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this

Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding were made.

 (f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Company, Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would, pursuant to applicable Law, escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided, however,_ that any investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation on the earlier of one year after the Effective Time or full payment of the Exchange Fund. 

  

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or, at the election of Parent or the Paying Agent, a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such 

   ##### 

   

    

Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate an amount in cash equal to the number of Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the
Merger Consideration. 

  

 (i) _No Further Ownership Rights_. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates. 

  

 Section 2.3 _Effect of the Merger on Company Stock Options and RSUs_. Except for Company Stock Options and RSUs as to which the treatment in the Merger is hereafter separately agreed by Parent and the holder thereof, which Company Stock Options and RSUs shall be treated as so agreed, subject to any applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code: 

  

 (a) Each option to acquire Shares (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") under the Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Option Plan (also known as the Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Plan) or the 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (collectively, the " _Equity Plans_ "), whether or not then vested or exercisable, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall, as of the Acceptance Time, become fully vested and be converted into the right to receive a payment in cash, payable in U.S. dollars and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per Share subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares for which such Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options the cash payments described in this Section 2.3(a), subject to the collection of the applicable withholding taxes as set forth in Section 2.3(d), on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Effective Time occurs, but in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter. 

  

 (b) Each restricted stock unit award (a " _RSU Award_ ") under the Equity Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled at the Effective Time. In exchange for each such canceled RSU Award, the holder shall be entitled to a lump sum cash distribution payable by the Surviving Corporation in an amount determined by multiplying the number of Shares subject to such canceled RSU Award, whether vested or unvested, by the Merger Consideration (the " _RSU Consideration_ "). The RSU Consideration for each cancelled RSU Award shall be paid to the holder of that canceled award on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the date on which the Effective Time occurs, but in any event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, subject to the collection of applicable withholding taxes as provided in Section 2.3(d). However, to the extent any RSU Award is subject to a deferred payment schedule pursuant to the applicable distribution provisions of Code Section 409A so that the RSU Consideration cannot be paid to the holder within such five (5) Business-Day period without the holders incurrence of a penalty tax and interest penalties under Code Section 409A, then the Surviving Corporation shall, within five (5) Business Days following the Effective Time, deposit the RSU Consideration for each such holder into a grantor trust that satisfies the requirements of Revenue Procedure 92-64 and that will accordingly serve as the funding source for the Surviving Corporation to satisfy its obligations to pay each such holder the held-back RSU Consideration to which such holder is entitled, together with accrued interest thereon, as that consideration becomes payable in one or more installments in accordance with 

   ##### 

  

    

the deferred payment schedule applicable to that award. A separate account
shall be booked under such grantor trust for each holder entitled to such
deferred RSU Consideration, and that account shall be fully-vested at all
times. However, the grantor trust shall at all time remain subject to the
claims of the general creditors of the Surviving Corporation, and each RSU
Award holder with an interest therein shall have only the rights of a general
creditor with respect to his or her portion of the deposited funds, which
shall be maintained and located at all times in the United States. Any
interest, earnings or other proceeds earned in respect of the
outstanding balance of the trust fund as a result of the investment thereof
by the trustee at the direction of the Company or the trust fund
beneficiaries, for the period commencing with the establishment of such trust
fund in accordance with this Section 2.3(b) and continuing through the date of
the final payment of that fund to the holders entitled to the deferred RSU
Consideration, shall be for the benefit of the beneficiaries of such trust
fund, who shall be entitled to participate ratably in such interest, earnings
or other proceeds. The deferred RSU Consideration per cancelled RSU
Award, together with all accrued interest, earnings or other proceeds thereon
through the actual payment date, shall be distributed to the holder of that
cancelled RSU Award upon the earliest to occur of (i) each semi-annual date
on which the Shares to which that RSU Consideration relates would have been
issued to the holder, pursuant to the issuance provisions in effect under that
RSU Award, in the absence of the Merger, (ii) the date such holder incurs a
separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A and the
applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder, subject to any required holdback
under Code Section 409A if the holder is a "specified employee" for Code
Section 409A purposes at the time of such separation from service, or (iii)
the first date on which the distribution can be made to such holder without
contravention of any applicable provisions of Code Section 409A, or as soon
as administratively practicable following such applicable date, but in
no event later than five (5) Business Days after the occurrence of such
applicable date. The holders of the RSU Awards shall, as of the Effective
Time, cease to have any further right or entitlement to acquire Shares or any
shares of the capital stock of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
under their canceled RSU Awards but shall at all times be fully-vested in
their RSU Consideration, together with any interest, earnings or other
proceeds that accrues thereon while that consideration may be deposited in
the grantor trust in accordance herewith. 

  

 (c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the then-current offering period (as set forth in the Companys Amended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ")) shall terminate (the " _Final Date_ ") and the payroll deductions of each participant accumulated as of the Final Date for the then-current offering period shall be immediately applied to the purchase of whole Shares in accordance with the terms of the ESPP, which number of Shares shall be canceled and be converted in the Merger into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a) with respect to such Shares. 

  

 (d) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.3 to any holder of Company Stock Options or an RSU Award such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, or local Tax Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall make any required filings with and payments to Tax authorities relating to any such deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the 

   ##### 

   

    

Company Stock Options or RSU Award in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) The Board of Directors (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall take such actions as are necessary in connection with the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3.

Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, endorse or recommend, any Alternative Proposal, (iv) execute or

propose or agree to do any of the foregoing; _provided, however,_ it is
understood and agreed that any determination or action by the Board of
Directors permitted under Section 5.2(c), Section 5.2(d) or Section
7.1(c)(iii), shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a breach or
violation of this Section 5.2(a) or, in the case of Section 5.2(c), give
Parent a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii). 

  

 (b) The Company shall, shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the parties hereto) that has made or indicated an intention to make an Alternative Proposal, in each case that exist as of the date hereof, and shall request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished in connection therewith. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.2(b), at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may, in response to an unsolicited written Alternative Proposal received after the date hereof which the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and the Companys financial advisor, constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and subject to the Board of Directors determining, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (i) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative Proposal and its Representatives and potential debt and equity financing sources pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company in the aggregate than the Confidentiality Agreement, including any standstill or similar covenants to which Parent is subject, and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its respective Representatives regarding such Alternative Proposal; _provided, however_ , that prior to furnishing information to, or engaging in negotiations or discussions with, any Person, the Company shall comply with Section 5.2(e); _provided, further,_ that the Company shall provide or make available to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided to the Person making such Alternative Proposal or its Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to Parent prior to or concurrently with or as soon as practicable after providing such information to such other Person. 

  

 (d) Except as set forth in Section 7.1(c)(iii) or this Section 5.2(d), neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or the Purchaser, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or the Purchaser, the Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, stock purchase agreement, option agreement or 

   ##### 

   

    

similar agreement constituting or relating to, or that is intended to be or
would reasonably be likely to result in, any Alternative Proposal or (iii)
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to
the Acceptance Time, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, (A)
after consultation with outside counsel and the Companys financial advisor,
that an unsolicited written Alternative Proposal received by the Company
constitutes a Superior Proposal (after complying with, and giving effect to
any commitments offered by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.2(d) or Section
7.1(c)(iii), and (B) after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board of
Directors exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Board
of Directors or any committee thereof may withdraw, or modify or qualify
its Recommendation (a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); _provided, however_ ,
that prior to a Change of Recommendation, (A) the Board of Directors shall
have determined that it has received a Superior Proposal, (B) the Company
shall have notified Parent and the Purchaser in writing of the Board
of Directors intention to make a Change of Recommendation pursuant to this
Section 5.2(d), and included with such notice the identity of the Person
making such proposal, the most current written agreement relating to the
transaction that constitutes such Superior Proposal and all
related transaction agreements, (C) the Company and its Representatives shall
have negotiated in good faith with Parent and the Purchaser (to the extent
Parent and the Purchaser desire to negotiate) to make adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Alternative Proposal
no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (D) at least five (5) Business
Days following both the receipt by Parent and the Purchaser of the notice
referred to in clause (B) above and the initiation of good faith negotiations
referred to in clause (C) above, and taking into account any revised proposal
committed to by Parent and the Purchaser since receipt of the notice referred
to in clause (B) above, the Board of Directors shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and the Companys financial
advisor, that such Superior Proposal continues to be more favorable to the
Company and its stockholders from a financial point of view than the revised
proposal committed to by Parent and the Purchaser, if any. 

  

 (e) The Company promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) shall advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers regarding any Alternative Proposal, (ii) any request for information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to be related or lead to an Alternative Proposal, and (iii) any inquiry or request for discussion or negotiation regarding or that would reasonably be expected to result in an Alternative Proposal, including in each case the identity of the Person making any such Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry or offer or request and the material terms and conditions of any such Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry or offer. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status (including any material changes to the terms thereof) of any such discussions or negotiations regarding any such Alternative Proposal or indication or inquiry or offer or any material developments relating thereto (the Company agreeing that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent but it being agreed that the third party financing sources may impose confidentiality restrictions on the Company with respect to their proposed financing). 

   ##### 

   

  

 (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any required disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of such Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside counsel, it is required to do so under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall this Section 5.2(f) affect the obligations of the Company specified in Section 5.2(d) or Section 5.2(e) and _provided, further that,_ any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) which would otherwise constitute a Change of Recommendation shall only be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation if the Board of Directors fails to expressly publicly reaffirm its Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after such disclosure. 

  

 (g) The Company shall not take any action to (i) exempt any Person (other than Parent, the Purchaser and their respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar provisions of any other Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply or (ii) terminate, amend, modify, make any determination under or waive any provision of the Rights Agreement, in each case unless such actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iii). 

  

 (h) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any _bona fide_  inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons other than Parent or one of its Affiliates relating to, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, (i) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving a direct or indirect acquisition of the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets (based on fair market value) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or (ii) the acquisition (including by way of tender or exchange offer) in any manner, directly or indirectly, of over 20% of (x) the issued and outstanding Company Common Stock or (y) the consolidated total assets (based on fair market value) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Merger. 

  

 (i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any Alternative Proposal on terms which the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and the Companys financial advisor, to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger to be effected pursuant to this Agreement, taking into account its consultation with outside counsel and the Companys financial advisor and all the terms and conditions of such proposal (including all legal, financial (including financing terms), regulatory and other aspects of such Alternative Proposal, as well as the likelihood and timing of consummation thereof) and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement committed to by Parent in good faith to the Company in response to such proposal or otherwise); _provided_ that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the definition of Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%." 

      ##### 

  

   

 Section 5.3 _Employee Matters; Equity Awards_. 

  

 (a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") who remains employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries annual base salary and base wages, cash incentive compensation opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation) and benefits that are in the aggregate comparable to such annual base salary and base wages, cash incentive compensation opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation) and benefits provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent legally permissible, (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing comparable coverage under a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the corresponding Old Plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall also cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under all other Company Benefit Plans and compensation and severance arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, provided that, subject to the requirements of Section 5.3(a), nothing herein shall prohibit the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any particular Company Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by its terms or applicable Law. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.3 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan for any purpose.

case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect

 (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies or purchase, or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy," in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such policy with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time and from insurance carriers with comparable credit ratings, except that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more than 250% of the annual premium paid by the 

   #####

Companys option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a
six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and
scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability

occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would
cause or result in any of the conditions to the Offer or the Merger set forth
in Annex A or Article VI not being satisfied or satisfaction of those
conditions being materially delayed in violation of any provision of
this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant

so notified would standing alone constitute such a failure.

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) or Section 7.1(d)(iii); 

  

then in any such event under clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 7.2(a), the
Company shall pay at the direction of Parent to any Person that is a U.S.
person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a termination fee of (x) six
million dollars ($6,000,000) plus (y) the amount equal to all of Parents
actual and reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually incurred or paid by Parent or
its Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Parent Expenses_
"), which amount shall in no event exceed three million dollars ($3,000,000),
in cash (collectively, the " _Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in
no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more
than one occasion. 

  

 (b) Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of Section 7.2(a) shall be made promptly following the consummation of, or entry into a definitive agreement with respect to, the transaction referred to therein, as the case may be (and in any event not later than 

   ##### 

   

    

two (2) Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for
payment after such event); any payment required to be made pursuant to clause
(ii) of Section 7.2(a) shall be made concurrently with, and as a condition to
the effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iii); and any payment required to be made pursuant
to clause (iii) of Section 7.2(a) shall be made promptly following
termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) or
Section 7.1(d)(iii), as applicable (and in any event not later than two (2)
Business Days after delivery to the Company of notice of demand for payment
after such event), and in each case such payment shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by
Parent. 

  

 (c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and the Purchaser, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parents right to receive payment of the Termination Fee from the Company shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and the Purchaser against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or agents for the loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 Section 8.5 _Jurisdiction; Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement to be performed by any party were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.

Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this Section 8.5, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer and in addition to the Purchasers rights to extend, amend or terminate the Offer in accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement and applicable Law, the Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act, pay for any validly tendered Shares and may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the restrictions referred to above, the payment for, any validly tendered Shares, if (a) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied at the Expiration Date, (b) any waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has not expired or terminated at or prior to the Expiration Date (the " _HSR Condition_ "), or (c) any of the following conditions exist or has occurred and is continuing at the Expiration Date: 

  

 (i) there shall be pending any suit, action or proceeding by any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction against Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or any Company Subsidiary challenging the acquisition by Parent or the Purchaser of any Shares pursuant to the Offer or seeking to make illegal, restrain or prohibit the making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger; 

  

 (ii) there shall be any statute, rule, regulation or Order enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated or which is deemed applicable pursuant to an authoritative interpretation by or on behalf of a Government Entity of competent jurisdiction to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or any other action shall be taken by any Governmental Entity, other than the application to the Offer or the Merger of applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act, that (x) is, in the reasonable judgment of Parent and the Purchaser, likely to result, directly or indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in paragraph (i) above, or (y) has the effect of making the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement illegal or which has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement; 

  

 (iii) (A) any representation or warranty of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement (without giving effect to any references to any Company Material Adverse Effect or materiality qualifications and other qualifications based upon the concept of materiality or similar phrases contained therein) shall fail to be true and correct in any respect as of the date of the Merger Agreement or as of the Expiration Date with the same force and effect as if made on and as of such date, except for representations and warranties that relate to a specific date or time (which need only be true and correct as of such date or time), except as have had, individually or in the aggregate with all other failures to be true or correct, a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

  

 (iv) the Company shall have breached or failed, in any material respect, to perform or to comply with any agreement or covenant to be performed or complied with by it under the Merger Agreement and such breach or failure shall not have been cured; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (v) since the date of the Merger Agreement, any fact(s), circumstance(s), event(s), change(s), effect(s) or occurrence(s) shall have occurred, which has had or would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

  

 (vi) the Purchaser shall have failed to receive a certificate of the Company, executed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, dated as of the Expiration Date, to the effect that the conditions set forth in paragraphs (iii) and (iv) of this Annex A have not occurred; or 

  

 (vii) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms. 

  

 The foregoing conditions (including those set forth in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of the initial paragraph) are for the sole benefit of Parent and the Purchaser and may be asserted by Parent or the Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent or the Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion, in each case subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Any reference in this Annex A or the Merger Agreement to a condition or requirement being satisfied shall be deemed to be satisfied if such condition or requirement is waived in accordance with the prior sentence hereto. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and the Purchaser to extend, terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The failure by Parent or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. 

  

 The capitalized terms used in this Annex A and not defined in this Annex A shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of February 3, 2009, by and among JLL PharmaNet Holdings, LLC, PDGI Acquisition Corp. and PharmaNet Development Group, Inc.
