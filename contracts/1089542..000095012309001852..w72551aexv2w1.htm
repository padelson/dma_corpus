<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;As promptly as practicable (and in any event within seven (7)&nbsp;Business Days) after the

respect of each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be
paid net to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.2(c). In circumstances in which the stockholders of the
Company do not have the right to seek remedies at law or equity, the obligations of Parent and the
Purchaser under this Agreement are material to the Company&#146;s execution of this Agreement and any
failure by Parent or the Purchaser to comply with the terms of this Agreement shall enable the
Company to seek all remedies available at law or equity to it and on behalf of the stockholders.
