ARTICLE 3 PURCHASE PRICE AND PRORATIONS OF CERTAIN LIABILITIES

Section 3.1 Purchase Price.

 

(a) In full consideration for the Purchased Assets, assumption of Assumed
Liabilities as of the Closing Date, and for the other promises and covenants
contained herein and in the other agreements to be delivered by Seller
hereunder, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 3.2, at the Closing,
Purchaser shall pay to Seller an aggregate amount in cash equal to (i)
twenty-four million dollars ($24,000,000) (the " _Purchase Price_ "); _minus_
(ii) the amount of the Holdback Funds; _minus_ (iii) the aggregate amount of
the Creditor Payments; and _plus or minus_ , as the case may be, (iv) the
Initial Working Capital Adjustment (the resulting amount is referred to as the
" _Closing Date Payment_ ").

 

(b) Seller shall have obtained from (i) each obligee to the Debt of Seller,
including any secured party set forth on  _Schedule 5.10(b)_ , and (ii) any
creditor of Seller to receive funds at Closing from Seller, a payoff letter
and/or lien release letter (the " _Payoff Letters_ "). To the extent
applicable, such letter shall include (A) the total obligation owing by
Seller to such creditor as of the Closing Date, (B) the total amount of Debt
(including all principal, interest, premium, prepayment penalties, and other
fees owing on such amounts) owed by Seller to such obligee as of the date of
the letter and a per diem amount through the Closing Date, (C) payment
instructions for wire transfer of such amount on the Closing Date, and (D) if
applicable, confirmation that the obligee shall terminate any lien filings
relating to such Debt of Seller upon payment of the amount specified in such
letter.

 



5 (c) On the Closing Date, Purchaser will:

 

(i) remit, on behalf of Seller, the aggregate amounts specified in the Payoff
Letters directly to each obligee thereof in accordance with the terms of each
such letter (such amounts, in the aggregate, the " _Creditor Payments_ ");

(ii) remit to Seller the Closing Date Payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to an account or accounts designated by Seller not less than
five (5) days prior to the Closing Date; and

(iii) deliver an unsecured promissory note to Seller in the amount of two
million, four hundred thousand dollars ($2,400,000) (the " _Holdback Funds_
") in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and Seller
(the " _Promissory Note_ ").

 

Section 3.2 Working Capital Adjustment.

(a) _Physical Inventory_. Prior to the Closing Date, the parties shall
establish an agreed-upon estimated value for the Inventory measured as of the
close of business on October 25, 2011 reflecting estimated adjustments for
non-demand, obsolete and slow moving Inventory, as such adjustments have been
applied to all Inventories of Seller in accordance with past practice and
agreed to by the parties. Such estimate shall be based on the Inventory
amounts reflected in Sellers September 30, 2011 balance sheet and Sellers
completion, to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser, of (i) an inventory
valuation to include raw materials, work-in progress, and finished goods,
with such valuation utilizing direct labor and factory overhead costs, as
historically applied, based on Sellers fiscal year ended December 31, 2010
final accounts and (ii) a roll-forward of such inventory valuation from the
September 30, 2011 calculations to the date of such estimate. Such estimate
shall include an adjustment to reflect excess/slow-moving and obsolete
inventory, which adjustment shall be based on the "no demand"
methodology currently applied by Seller to its inventory on hand at Closing
in accordance with the analysis and information provided by Seller and set
forth on _Schedule 3.2_. Beginning on or about October 24, 2011, Seller shall
commence the process of conducting a joint physical count of all Inventory
owned by Seller and transferred to Purchaser as of the Closing Date (the "
_Physical Inventory_ "). The Physical Inventory shall be observed by Grant
Thornton, LLC and Purchaser, with the final Physical Inventory count to be
concluded within two (2) days following the Closing. The same valuation
methodologies applied to the estimated Inventory valuation shall be applied to
the Physical Inventory to determine the final Inventory valuation to be used
for determining the Closing Date Working Capital.

(b) _Estimated Net Working Capital Calculation_. On the Closing Date, Seller
shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser an estimated balance sheet as of the
end of the day on October 25, 2011 (the " _Estimated Working Capital
Statement_ ") setting forth Sellers

 



6  good faith estimation of the Net Working Capital of Seller as of such date
(the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "). In determining the Estimated
Closing Working Capital, the parties agree that the Inventory value estimate
shall be determined as provided in Section 3.2(a) above and both parties will
exercise their reasonable best efforts to ensure that such Inventory estimate
is as close to a final valuation as is practical under the circumstances. In
no event, however, will the methodology used to calculate labor and overhead
be subject to any post-Closing revision. In the event the Estimated Closing
Working Capital is _less_ than $5,800,000 (the " _Target Working Capital_ "),
the Purchase Price will be decreased, on a dollar for dollar basis, by the
amount of such shortfall. In the event the Estimated Closing Working Capital
_exceeds_ the Target Working Capital, the Purchase Price will be increased,
on a dollar for dollar basis, by the amount of such excess. The resulting
shortfall or excess is referred to as the " _Initial Working Capital
Adjustment_ ".

 

(c) _Closing Date Working Capital Schedule_. On or before sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare and deliver to Seller a
statement (the " _Closing Date Working Capital Statement_ ") setting forth
Purchasers computation of the Net Working Capital of Seller as of the end of
the day on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Date Working Capital_ "), using a
final Inventory value as determined in accordance with Section 3.2(a) above
based on the Physical Inventory. The Closing Date Working Capital will be
determined in a manner consistent with determination of the Estimated Working
Capital as set forth on _Schedule 3.2(c)_. During such period, Seller will
provide Purchaser and its representatives with access to all records necessary
to prepare the Closing Date Working Capital Statement and the computations
therein retained by Seller, if any.

(d) _Review of Closing Date Working Capital Statement; Disputes_.

(i) Upon receipt of the Closing Date Working Capital Statement, Seller
(together with Sellers professional advisors) will have the right during the
succeeding thirty (30) day period (the " _Review Period_ ") to examine all
information contained in the books and records used to prepare the Closing
Date Working Capital Statement. Purchaser will provide to Seller and its
professional advisors reasonable access to materials (including accountants
work papers) used to prepare the Closing Date Working Capital
Statement during normal business hours.

(ii) If Seller disagrees with the calculation of the Closing Date
Working Capital set forth in the Closing Date Working Capital Statement, it
must notify Purchaser in writing on or before the last day of the Review
Period, setting forth a specific description of Sellers objection(s), the
amount of the adjustment which Seller believes should be made to each item to
which it objects, and a detailed description of the basis for Sellers
disagreement therewith (such notice, a " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). In the
event that Seller does not provide a Notice of Disagreement in accordance
with the terms above on or before the last day of the Review Period or Seller
affirmatively notifies Purchaser in writing that Seller agrees with the
calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital set forth on the

 



7  Closing Date Working Capital Statement, Seller will be deemed to have
accepted the Closing Date Working Capital Statement delivered by Purchaser and
the calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital set forth therein will be
final, binding, and conclusive for all purposes hereunder.

(e)  _Determination of Final Net Working Capital_.

(i) If Seller does provide a Notice of Disagreement in accordance with the
terms above on a timely basis, Purchaser and Seller will use their respective
best efforts for a period of fifteen (15) days (or such longer period as they
may mutually agree in writing, the " _Private Resolution Period_ ") to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation of Closing Date
Working Capital. The objections set forth in the Notice of Disagreement that
are resolved by Seller and Purchaser in accordance with this Section
3.2(e)(i) will collectively be referred to herein as the " _Resolved
Objections_ " and the Closing Date Working Capital Statement will be adjusted
to reflect any Resolved Objections.

 

(ii) If, at the end of the Private Resolution Period, Seller and Purchaser are
unable to resolve all of the objections set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement, Seller and Purchaser will jointly engage RSM McGladrey or
another local accounting firm mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Seller (the
" _Independent Auditors_ ") within five (5) days of the end of the Private
Resolution Period to resolve any remaining disagreements. Seller and Purchaser
must jointly submit a listing of the objections set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement that remain outstanding (collectively, the " _Differences_ "),
together with a statement of the facts submitted by Seller and Purchaser,
respectively, and such arguments as either of them chooses to make in
connection therewith (each such a " _Statement of Claims_ "), in writing to
the Independent Auditors within ten (10) days after the Independent Auditors
engagement.

(iii) The Independent Auditors, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, will
review the Differences and the Statement of Claims. The Independent Auditors
will determine, within fifteen (15) days of the date on which such dispute is
referred, based on the requirements set forth in this Article 3 and only with
respect to the Differences and Statement of Claims timely submitted to the
Independent Auditors, what adjustments (if any) to the Closing Date Working
Capital Statement are required in order for it to accurately set forth the Net
Working Capital of Seller as of the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section
3.2(e), the parties will share ratably the fees and expenses of
the Independent Auditors as follows: (A) if the Independent Auditors resolve
all of the remaining Differences in favor of Seller, Purchaser will be
responsible for all of the fees and expenses of the Independent Auditors, (B)
if the Independent Auditors resolve all of the remaining Differences in favor
of Purchaser, Seller will be responsible for all of the fees and expenses of
the Independent Auditors, or (C) if the Independent Auditors resolve some of
the Differences in favor of Seller and the rest of the Differences in favor
of Purchaser, each of Purchaser and Seller will share the fees and expenses of
the Independent Auditors equally. The determination of the 

 



8  Independent Auditors, solely as it relates to the Closing Date Working
Capital Statement, will be final, conclusive, and binding on the parties. The
accepted or finally determined Closing Date Working Capital Schedule (whether
determined pursuant to Section 3.2(d)(ii) or this Section 3.2(e)) is referred
to as the " _Final Working Capital Schedule_." The date on which the Closing
Date Working Capital of Seller is finally determined in accordance with this
Section 3.2 is hereinafter referred to as the " _Settlement Date_."

(f) If the Final Working Capital Statement shows the Closing Date Working
Capital is _less_ than the Estimated Closing Working Capital, the Purchase
Price will be decreased, on a dollar for dollar basis, by the amount of such
shortfall. If the Final Working Capital Statement shows the Closing Date
Working Capital _exceeds_ the Estimated Closing Working Capital, the Purchase
Price will be increased, on a dollar for dollar basis, by the amount of such
excess. All such payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 3.2(f)
shall be satisfied, in the case of amounts owed by Seller through a reduction
in the amount payable to Seller pursuant to the Promissory Note, or in the
case of amounts owed by Purchaser, through wire transfer of immediately
available funds. Any such payment by Purchaser shall be made no later than two
(2) Business Days following the Settlement Date. The Purchase Price after
final adjustment for the changes, if any, provided for in Section 3.2(b) and
this Section 3.2(f) shall be referred to as the " _Final Purchase Price_."

 

(g) _No Basis for Other Claims_. Any matter taken into account in the
determination of the Closing Date Working Capital shall not also be the basis
for any claim against Seller for any misrepresentation or the breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller contained in this Agreement or any
Transaction Document or any certificate delivered by Seller in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (i) solely to the extent of the
amount taken into account in the determination of the Closing Date Working
Capital and (ii) except to the extent new or additional information
becomes known to Purchaser after the Settlement Date.

Section 3.3 Prorations. The following prorations relating to the Purchased
Assets will be made as of the Closing Date, with Seller liable to the extent
such items relate to any time period up to and including the Closing Date and
Purchaser liable to the extent such items relate to periods subsequent to
the Closing Date.

(a) The amount of charges for sewer, water, fuel, telephone, electricity,
natural gas, and other utilities for the Leased Real Property to the extent
that Purchaser is not able to establish its own account directly with such
utility provider as of the Closing Date; _provided_ that if practicable, meter
readings will be taken at the Closing Date and the respective obligations of
the parties determined in accordance with such readings.

(b) If any item described in this Section 3.3 cannot be prorated, adjusted or
determined as of the Closing Date, then it shall be separately prorated,
adjusted, determined, and paid by the responsible party as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date.

 



9 (c) If any of the foregoing proration amounts cannot be determined as of
the Closing Date due to final bills therefore not being issued as of the
Closing Date, the parties will prorate such items as and when the actual bills
therefore are issued to the appropriate party. The party owing amounts to the
other by means of such prorations shall pay the same within thirty (30) days
following such proration.

Section 3.4 Allocation of Purchase Price. The parties agree that the
aggregate Final Purchase Price (including the assumption by Purchaser of the
Assumed Liabilities and all other capitalized costs) will be allocated among
the Purchased Assets for Tax purposes in accordance with  _Schedule 3.4_
attached hereto. Purchaser and Seller will follow and use such allocation in
all Tax Returns, filings, or other related reports made by any of them to any
governmental agencies. To the extent that disclosures of this allocation are
required to be made by the parties to the IRS under the provisions of Section
1060 of the Code, or any regulations thereunder, Purchaser and Seller will
disclose such reports to the other party prior to filing them with the IRS. 

Section 3.5 Sales and Transfer Taxes. Seller and Purchaser agree that the cost
of any sales tax to be paid to the State of California on the sale of
furniture, fixtures, and equipment that are part of the Purchased Assets shall
be paid by Purchaser. All other sales, use, stamp, registration, transfer or
other Taxes or recording fees and charges imposed on Seller or Purchaser by
any Governmental Authority as a result of the sale of the Purchased Assets or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
paid by the party incurring such Tax, recording fee or charge.

relating thereto arising from an alleged breach of this Section 5.19(a). Any
funds received after the Closing by Purchaser as payment for accounts

Section 9.2 Notice and Opportunity to Defend

(a) As soon as is reasonably practicable after a Seller Indemnified Party or
Purchaser Indemnified Party, as the case may be, becomes aware of any claim
that it has under Section 9.1 that may result in a Loss (a " _Liability Claim_
"), such Person (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give notice thereof (a "
_Claims Notice_ ") to the party hereto that is obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to such claim (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ").
A Claims Notice shall describe the Liability Claim in reasonable detail, and
shall indicate the amount (estimated, if necessary and to the extent feasible)
of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnified Party. No
delay in or failure to give a Claims Notice by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 9.2(a) shall adversely affect any
of the other rights or remedies which the Indemnified Party has under this
Agreement, or alter or relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent that such delay or failure has
not materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 

(b) To the extent that any Liability Claim relates to a third party
proceeding, the Indemnifying Party may elect, by providing written notice to
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Claims Notice
from the Indemnified Party of the commencement or assertion of any Liability
Claim in respect of which indemnity may be

 



31  sought hereunder, to assume and conduct the defense of such Liability Claim
in accordance with the limits set forth in this Agreement with counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a
Liability Claim in accordance with this Section 9.2(b), the Indemnified Party
may continue to defend the Liability Claim. If the Indemnifying Party has
assumed the defense of a Liability Claim as provided in this Section 9.2(b),
the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof;
_provided, however_ , that if (i) the Indemnifying Party fails to take
reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Liability Claim or (ii) a
settlement of, or adverse judgment with respect to the Liability Claim may be
expected to have a material adverse effect on, or is likely to establish a
precedential custom or practice materially adverse to the continuing business
or Tax position of the Indemnified Party (including, without limitation, any
increase in the Tax liability of Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof), the
Indemnified Party may assume its own defense, and the Indemnifying Party shall
be liable for all reasonable costs or expenses paid or incurred in connection
therewith. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may
be, shall have the right to participate in (but not control), at its own
expense, the defense of any Liability Claim which the other is defending as
provided in this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party, if it shall have assumed
the defense of any Liability Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such
Liability Claim which (i) does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party a
complete release from all liability in respect of such Liability Claim, or
(ii) grants any injunctive or equitable relief, or (iii) may reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on, or is likely to establish a
precedential custom or practice material adverse to, the continuing business
or Tax position of the Indemnified Party (including, without limitation, any
increase in the Tax liability of Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof). The
Indemnified Party shall not settle any Liability Claim, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

Section 9.3 Survivability / Limitations on Indemnification 

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement
or in any Ancillary Agreement, and the right of Purchasers to seek
indemnification as a result of any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, shall survive for a period of twenty four (24)
calendar months from the Closing Date (the " _Expiration Date_ "); _provided,
however_ , that:

(i) the Expiration Date will not apply for any Liability Claim relating to a
breach of or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of Seller
contained in Section 5.1 (Organization and Standing), Section 5.2 (Authority),
Section 5.6 (Title), or Section 5.32 (Brokerage and Finders Fees);

(ii) the representations and warranties of Seller contained in Section 5.5
(Environmental Matters), Section 5.7 (Taxes) and Section 5.24(a) (Employee
Benefit Plans and Other Plans) shall survive for the duration of any
applicable statute of limitations, the duration of any suspension, waiver
or extension thereof, and for ninety (90) days thereafter;

 



32 (iii) all of the covenants and agreements of Seller and any
Shareholder contained in this Agreement shall survive after the date of this
Agreement and be enforceable in accordance with their terms without
expiration; and

(iv) any Liability Claim pending on any Expiration Date for which a Claims
Notice has been given in accordance with Section 9.2 on or before such
Expiration Date may continue to be asserted and indemnified against until
finally resolved.

The representations and warranties listed in clause (i) of this Section
9.3(a), Section 5.7 and Section 5.24 are referred to as the " _Fundamental
Representations_ ".

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party
for any Loss under Section 9.1(a)(i) until the aggregate amount of all Losses
sustained by one or more Purchaser Indemnified Parties exceeds $100,000 in the
aggregate (the " _Basket_ "), in which case each Purchaser Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder to the extent Losses exceed
the Basket, only up to but not exceeding, in the aggregate, twenty percent
(20%) of the Final Purchase Price (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified
Party with respect to individual Losses under Section 9.1(a)(i) of less than
$10,000 each (the " _Mini Basket_ ") and such Losses shall not be counted
toward the Basket. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Basket, Mini Basket, and Cap shall not apply to Losses
sustained by a Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result of Sellers breach of a
Fundamental Representations or arising out of a fraud claim brought by
Purchaser against Seller.

(c) Further notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Purchaser
Indemnified Party for any Loss under Section 9.1(a)(i) relating to any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Seller to
the extent that Seller can prove that (i) Purchaser or any Purchaser
Indemnified Party had actual written knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach
arising from information provided in the period between August 2, 2011 and the
Closing, (ii) the CEO, CFO or COO of Purchaser or John Glover fully
understood the scope and significance of such knowledge prior to the Closing
and (iii) such Losses arose solely from the inaccuracy or breach to which
Purchaser had Knowledge. 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall not have to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party for any
Loss under Section 9.1(b)(i) until the aggregate amount of all Losses
sustained by one or more Seller Indemnified Parties exceeds the Basket, in
which case each Seller Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification
hereunder to the extent Losses exceed the Basket, up to but not exceeding, in
the aggregate, the Cap; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not

 



33  have to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party with respect to individual
Losses under Section 9.1(b)(i) of less than the Mini Basket and such Losses
shall not be counted toward the Basket. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Basket, Mini Basket, and Cap shall
not apply to Losses sustained by a Seller Indemnified Party as a result of
Purchasers breach of the representations and warranties of Purchaser
contained in Section 6.1 (Organization and Standing), Section 6.2 (Authority),
and Section 6.3 (Brokerage and Finders Fees) or arising out of a fraud claim
brought by Seller against Purchaser.

 

(e) Absent fraud, the indemnification provided for in Section 9.1 of this
Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive post-Closing remedy available to
any party against the other parties for any Losses arising under or based upon
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(f) Absent fraud, no party hereto will be entitled to receive from any other
party hereto punitive, incidental, special or consequential damages as a
result of Losses hereunder; _provided, however_ that this limitation shall not
apply with respect to any Losses that arise from a Liability Claim involving a
third party proceeding if such punitive, incidental, special or consequential
damages are claimed by such third party.

(g) For the purposes of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Article 9, any Losses shall be determined on a net basis after giving effect
to any actual cash payments, setoffs, recoupment, or any other payments in
each case received, realized, or retained by the indemnified party (including
any amounts recovered or recoverable by the indemnified party from
unaffiliated third party insurance providers) as a result of any event giving
rise to a claim for such indemnification.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification for a breach of the
representation set forth in the first sentence of Section 5.27 relating to any
modifications or changes made to (i) that portion of the Acquired Assets
constituting equipment or (ii) the Leased Real Property, including any
systems relating thereto, that may constitute a violation of Legal
Requirements except to the extent that any such violation gives rise to a Loss
originating from a Governmental Authority relating to a period prior to
the Closing Date or a third party injured prior to the Closing Date by such
violation.

Section 9.4 Manner of Satisfying Losses.

(a) Payments owed by Seller in satisfaction of Sellers indemnification
obligations pursuant to this Article 9 shall be (i) first offset against the
balance owing to Seller under the Promissory Note and, to the extent amounts
recovered by Purchaser Indemnified Party are not sufficient to satisfy all
Losses in full, (ii) then the balance of such Losses shall be paid directly
by Seller.

 



34 (b) Upon Final Determination of the amount of a Liability Claim for
which indemnification is sought under this Article 9, the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the amount of such Liability Claim within ten (10) days of the date
of such Final Determination. For purposes of this Section 9.4(b), the "
_Final Determination_ " of a Liability Claim shall be the earliest to occur
of the following: (i) a judgment of any court determining the validity of a
disputed Liability Claim, if no appeal is pending from such judgment or if the
time to appeal therefrom has elapsed (it being understood that the
Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to appeal); (ii) an award of any
arbitrator or arbitration panel determining the validity of a disputed
Liability Claim, if there is not pending any motion to set aside such award
or if the time within which to move to set such award aside has elapsed; (iii)
a written acknowledgement of the Indemnifying Party that it no longer disputes
the validity of such Liability Claim; (iv) the date on which an Indemnifying
Party fails to respond to a Claim Notice as specified in Section 9.2; or (v)
such other evidence of final determination of a disputed Liability Claim as
shall be reasonably acceptable to the parties.

Section 9.5 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made by any party hereto will be treated as adjustments to the Final
Purchase Price.

obtained, Seller and Purchaser will cooperate with each other to provide for
Purchaser the benefits of, and to permit Purchaser to assume all liabilities
under, any such claim, Contract, lease, commitment or sales or purchase

with such calculations and the amount transferred.

 

Section 10.7 Further Assurances. From and after the Closing, Purchaser and
Seller will, and each will cause their respective Affiliates to execute and

pertaining to matters other than the Business or the Purchased Assets.

(b) From and after the Closing, Seller agrees to maintain for as long as
necessary amounts of cash in the bank accounts used for the operation of the
Business prior to Closing sufficient to cover any and all checks, drafts, and
other draws that are outstanding against such accounts as of the Closing
Date. 

 



37 (c) From and after the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall use
their reasonable good faith efforts to reconcile, on or about forty five (45)

Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement that are drawn from the bank accounts of
Seller after the Closing Date, and (ii) the amount, if any, of the accounts
receivable and other customer and/or supplier payments relating to the
Purchased Assets that are remitted to and/or deposited by such customers

provide such services remotely via teleconference to the extent appropriate in
the circumstances and shall not be required to travel to any locations other
than the Business facilities in Orange and Long Beach, California without
reimbursement from Purchaser of his reasonable travel expenses. Mr. Caracciolo
is being requested to provide such guidance based on his knowledge and
experience, and Purchaser agrees that Mr. Caracciolos insight and
counsel can be provided in a limited amount of time by him. He shall provide
such services at such times as it does not interfere with his other business
and personal activities. In no event shall Mr. Caracciolo be required to be
available more than twenty (20) hours per month on a noncumulative basis
during said six (6) month period.
