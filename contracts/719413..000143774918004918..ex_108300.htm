equivalent to or better than those contemplated by this Agreement (an "
**Alternative Transaction** "), the Company agrees to support the completion
of such Alternative Transaction in the same manner as the Arrangement and
shall otherwise fulfill its covenants contained in this Agreement in respect
of such Alternative Transaction. In particular, but without limitation, the
Company agrees that the "initial deposit period" in respect of any such
Alternative Transaction that is structured as a formal take-over bid shall be
the period determined by the Purchaser so long as it is not less than 35 days.
In the event of any proposed Alternative Transaction, any reference in this
Agreement to the Arrangement shall refer to the Alternative Transaction to the
extent applicable, all terms, covenants, representations and warranties of
this Agreement shall be and shall be deemed to have been made in the context

(A)

If the Purchaser and the Company conclude after the date of this Agreement
that it is necessary or desirable to proceed with a form of transaction other
than pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement (including, without limitation, a
take-over bid) whereby the Purchaser and/or its affiliates would effectively
acquire all the Subject Shares on economic terms and other terms and
conditions having consequences to the Shareholder that are substantially
equivalent to or better than those contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement
(any such transaction is referred to as an " **Alternative Transaction** "),
the Shareholder agrees to (as applicable) support the completion of the
Alternative Transaction in the same manner as this Agreement provides with
respect to the Arrangement, including, in the case of a take-over bid, by
causing all of the Shareholder's Subject Shares to be validly tendered in
acceptance of such take-over bid together with the letter of transmittal and,
if applicable, notice of guaranteed delivery, and any other documents required
in accordance with such take-over bid, and will not withdraw the Shareholder's
Subject Shares from such take-over bid except as expressly otherwise provided
in this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 2.3 Covenants of the Purchaser**

  



  

The Purchaser hereby agrees to comply with its obligations under the
Arrangement Agreement. The Purchaser hereby agrees and confirms to the
Shareholder that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to complete
the Arrangement and cause the Consideration to be made available to pay for
the Subject Securities in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions of the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement. The
Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Shareholder: (i) decrease the Consideration payable per
Subject Security pursuant to the Arrangement; (ii) change the amount or form
of Consideration payable pursuant to the Arrangement (other than to increase
the total Consideration per Subject Security or to add additional
Consideration); (iii) impose additional conditions to completion of the
Arrangement; or (iv) otherwise substantively vary the Arrangement or any terms
or conditions thereof in a manner that is materially adverse to shareholders
of the Company.

If any claim or proceeding for which any of the Transferor Indemnified Parties
may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this indemnity is brought
against any of the Transferor Indemnified Parties (a " **Transferor Claim**
"), such Transferor Indemnified Party, as applicable, shall give notice (the "
**Transferor Indemnity Notice** ") to the Transferee specifying the
particulars of such Transferor Claim within 10 Business Days after it receives
notification of the Transferor Claim. The Transferee shall have the right to
participate in any negotiations or proceedings with respect to such Transferor
Claim. If the Transferee has not, within 20 Business Days after the giving of
the Transferor Indemnity Notice, given notice to such Transferor Indemnified
Party/Parties, as applicable, that it wishes to dispute such Transferor Claim
then such Transferor Indemnified Party/Parties may assume the defence of such
Transferor Claim. If the Transferee does give such a notice, it shall have the
right to assume the defence of such Transferor Claim and to defend such
Transferor Claim in the name of such Transferor Indemnified Party/Parties, as
applicable, at the sole cost and expense of the Transferee. Each Transferor
Indemnified Party shall provide to the Transferee copies of all files, books,
records and other information in its possession or control which may be
relevant to the defence of such Transferor Claim, provided that in no case
shall any Transferor Indemnified Party be required to provide information that
is privileged or confidential or that a Transferor Indemnified Party is
restricted from disclosing pursuant to applicable law or any contract. Each of
the Transferor Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall co-operate in all
reasonable respects in the defence of such Transferor Claim, provided that the
Transferee shall not settle or compromise any such Transferor Claim without
the prior written consent of the Transferor Indemnified Party/Parties, as
applicable, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the
Transferee fails after the giving of such notice, diligently and reasonably to
defend such Transferor Claim throughout the period that such Transferor Claim
exists, its right to defend the Transferor Claim shall terminate and such
