 **CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT**

 



 

 **THIS CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT** (including the exhibits and schedules hereto,
each as amended or restated from time to time, this " ** _Agreement_** "),
dated as of May 8, 2017 (the " ** _Execution Date_** "), is by and between
Enviva Wilmington Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" **
_Transferor_** "), and Enviva Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership ("
** _Transferee_** "). Transferor and Transferee are collectively referred to
as the " ** _Parties_** " and individually as a " ** _Party_**."

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as of the Execution Date, Transferor owns 100% of the issued
and outstanding limited liability company interests (the " ** _Contributed
Interests_** ") in Enviva Port of Wilmington, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (" ** _Wilmington_** "), which owns a marine export terminal
located at the Port of Wilmington, North Carolina, capable of receiving,
storing, discharging and loading industrial wood pellet biomass for export by
ocean-going vessels (the " ** _Wilmington Terminal_** ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Transferor desires to contribute the Contributed Interests to
Transferee in exchange for the consideration, and on the other terms and
conditions, set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , immediately following the contribution of the Contributed
Interests to Transferee, Transferee shall contribute (i) 99.999% of the
Contributed Interests to Enviva, LP, a Delaware limited partnership and wholly
owned subsidiary of Transferee (" ** _Enviva, LP_** "), and (ii) 0.001% of the
Contributed Interests to Enviva GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
and the general partner of Enviva, LP (" ** _Enviva GP, LLC_** "), and
immediately upon receipt thereof, Enviva GP, LLC shall contribute 0.001% of
the Contributed Interests to Enviva, LP;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Conflicts Committee (the " ** _Conflicts Committee_** ") of
the Board of Directors of Enviva Partners GP, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company and the general partner of Transferee (the " ** _General
Partner_** "), has (i) received an opinion of Evercore Group L.L.C., the
financial advisor to the Conflicts Committee (the " ** _Financial Advisor_**
"), that the Purchase Price to be paid by Transferee in the Transaction is
fair, from a financial point of view, to Transferee and the holders of common
units representing limited partner interests in Transferee other than the
General Partner, Enviva Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (" **
_EH_** "), John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.) and their respective
affiliates, and (ii) determined in good faith that the Transaction, including
the Contribution Documents, and the exhibits and schedules thereto, taken as a
whole, are fair and reasonable to, and in the best interest of, Transferee and
the holders of common units representing limited partner interests in
Transferee (including the General Partner), other than Transferor and its
subsidiaries.

covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

faith calculation of the difference between the Closing Net Working Capital
and the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital (the " ** _Net Adjustment
Amount_** "). Within five Business Days after delivery of such statement from
Transferor to Transferee, if the Net Adjustment Amount is positive, then
Transferee shall pay to Transferor such amount and if the Net Adjustment
Amount is negative, then Transferor shall pay to Transferee such amount, in
each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by the payee.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to or at
the Closing, Transferor may cause Wilmington to distribute all or any portion
of the cash held by Wilmington.

qualification or licensing necessary, except in any jurisdiction where the
failure to be so duly qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Liens) on the Contributed Interests, other than Liens created by or on behalf
of Transferee.

 



 

Section 3.5 **_Legal Proceedings_**. Except with respect to the Retained

contemplated herein or (c) would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect Wilmington or the Wilmington Terminal. Except with respect to

Wilmington has not sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or had an obligation
to contribute to any plan, policy, understanding, arrangement, written

indemnification under _Section 7.2(a)_ (a " ** _Tax Contest_** "), the party
receiving such notice shall notify the other within 15 Business Days of
receipt of the notice of deficiency or other proposed adjustment, _provided_
that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ except to the extent Transferee shall
have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Provided that
Transferor notifies Transferee of its intent to control such Tax Contest
within 15 Business Days after receipt of notification from Transferee or
delivery of notification to Transferor as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, Transferor will have the right, at its expense, to control
the defense of such Tax Contest. With respect to any Tax Contest for which
Transferor exercises its right to control, Transferor shall (i) notify
Transferee of significant developments with respect to such Tax Contest and
keep Transferee reasonably informed and consult with Transferee as to the
resolution of any issue that would materially affect Transferee and (ii) give
Transferee a copy of any Tax adjustment proposed in writing with respect to
such Tax Contest and copies of any other written correspondence with the
relevant Governmental Entity relating to such Tax Contest. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions in this _Section
5.4(d)_ shall apply to any Tax Contest and the procedures in _Section 7.3_
shall not be applicable to a Tax Contest.

 



 

Section 5.5 **_Updating_**. From time to time until the Closing, Transferor
may at its option supplement or amend and deliver written updates to (or add
Schedules to) the Disclosure Schedules as necessary to disclose any events or
developments that occur or information that is learned between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date. Transferor shall be considered in
material breach of this Agreement for purposes of _Section 8.1(c)_ if the
event, action,

 



      
 

 



 

development or occurrence which is the subject of the supplement, amendment or
update (a) constitutes a material breach by Transferor of any provision of
this Agreement or (b) has a Material Adverse Effect, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the case of _subclauses (a)_ or _(b)_ , in the event Transferee
provides notice of termination for a material breach of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ as a result of any supplement, amendment or
update, Transferor shall have a period of 30 days following written notice
from Transferee to cure any breach of this Agreement if the breach is curable;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, if Transferee does not elect to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_ as a result thereof, any such update
made pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall be considered for purposes of
determining whether the condition in _Section 6.2(b)_ has been satisfied, but
shall be disregarded for purposes of (x) determining whether the condition in
_Section 6.2(c)_ has been satisfied and (y) _Article VII_.

Units are included as part of the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.2_,

Closing (with respect to Closing New Common Units) or the Hamlet Payment Time
(with respect to Hamlet New Common Units), as applicable, or, in any event, as
soon as practicable following the Closing or the Hamlet Payment Time, as
applicable, on The New York Stock Exchange, upon official notice of issuance,
any such New Common Units.

 



 

Section 5.7 **_Retained Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Transferor shall retain,
be entitled to all benefits associated with, and have the right to control,
the Retained Matters. If, following Closing, Transferee or Wilmington receives
any proceeds or recoveries in connection with the Retained Matters, then
Transferee shall, and shall cause Wilmington to, promptly pay to Transferor
all such proceeds and recoveries. Further, from and after Closing, to the
extent commercially reasonable, Transferee shall, and shall cause Wilmington
to, not take any action with the intent to impair the benefits of, or be
detrimental to Transferor, Transferors Affiliates or Wilmington (solely to
the extent relating to the Retained Matters) in the advancement or defense of
the Retained Matters.

 



 

(b) Prior to or at the Closing, Transferor shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to assign, transfer or otherwise convey the Retained Matters (to the
extent assignable or transferable to Transferor in accordance with the terms
thereof or under applicable Law) to one or more designees. To the extent such
full assignment, transfer or conveyance has not been made or obtained prior to
or at the Closing, Transferee agrees that, from and after the Closing, if
requested by Transferor, it shall and shall cause Wilmington to, enter into an
assignment agreement or similar conveyance document to transfer the Retained
Matters from Wilmington to Transferor or its designee.

 



 

(c) From and after Closing with respect to the Retained Matters, Transferee
shall, and shall cause Wilmington to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Transferor and its Affiliates by (i) providing Transferor and
Transferors Representatives with reasonable access, upon reasonable prior
notice and during normal business hours to Wilmington, the Wilmington Terminal
and Wilmingtons Assets (including access to and the ability, at Transferors
sole expense, to make copies of the records, correspondence, emails and other

 



      
 

 



 

information relating to Wilmington in connection with or related to the
Retained Matters) for purposes of advancing or defending the Retained Matters,
and/or producing information as part of discovery or equivalent procedures
with respect to the Retained Matters to the extent that such access does not
unreasonably interfere with the business of Transferee, Wilmington or their
respective Affiliates or the safe commercial operations of the Wilmington
Terminal or any Assets of Wilmington, and (ii) if requested by Transferor,
entering into any settlement agreement with the counterparties to the Retained
Matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such settlement shall be entered
into without the consent of Transferee unless it includes a full unconditional
release of Transferee and its subsidiaries, including Wilmington, from all
liability with respect to the related claim and does not contain any admission
of wrongdoing or illegal conduct; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that no such
settlement containing any form of injunctive or similar relief shall be
entered into without the prior written consent of Transferee, which consent
shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. Each of Transferor and
Transferee agrees that, if requested by the other, it shall enter into a
mutually agreed joint defense agreement. Transferee shall also make available
or cause Wilmington to make available to Transferor and Transferors
Representatives (upon reasonable prior notice and request by or on behalf of
Transferee or Transferors Affiliates) personnel of Transferee or Wilmington
for purposes of advancing or defending its position in the Retained Matters or
serving as a witness or witnesses in any hearing, action or proceeding
relating to the Retained Matters; _provided_ , _however_ , that Transferee
shall have the right to have a Representative present for any communication
with employees or officers of Transferee, Wilmington or their respective
Affiliates. Transferor shall reimburse Transferee or Wilmington, as
applicable, at agreed hearing rates for the provision of witness services.

 



 

(d) From and after Closing, Transferor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Transferee, Wilmington and their respective Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives, from and against any and all Damages
incurred by any such Person arising out of the access rights under _Section
5.7(c)_, including in respect of any claims against Transferee or its
Affiliates by any Representatives of Transferor for any injuries or property
damage sustained while present at the Wilmington Terminal.

 



 

Section 5.8 **_Payment of Closing Date Punch List Items_** (a). No later than
five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Transferor will prepare and
deliver to Transferee a list of all Punch List Items and the approximate costs
and expenses necessary to complete or correct each such Punch List Item that
has not been completed or corrected prior to such date. Upon its receipt of
such list (the " ** _Closing Date Punch List Items_** "), Transferee will
review and direct Transferor to make any appropriate or necessary revisions to
the same, after which Transferee and Transferor will consult in good faith to
agree upon the Closing Date Punch List Items. Following the Closing,
Transferor shall promptly reimburse Transferee and its Affiliates (including
Wilmington) for all reasonable amounts paid by Transferee or its Affiliates
(including Wilmington) that are necessary to complete the Closing Date Punch
List Items within 30 days after Transferee provides written notice and
satisfactory documentation to Transferor of the amount and nature of any such
costs or expenses.

 



 

Section 5.9 **_Hamlet Payment Date Notice_** (a). Transferor shall have the
sole right to determine the Hamlet Payment Date (in accordance with this
_Section 5.9_ and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement) unless
the Parties agree otherwise. Accordingly, not later than 90

 



      
 

 



 

days prior to the date on which Hamlet reasonably expects to first deliver
Biomass to Wilmington pursuant to the Hamlet-Wilmington TSA, Transferor shall,
or shall cause Hamlet to, deliver written notice to Transferee and Wilmington
(a) setting forth the anticipated first delivery date of such Biomass and (b)
specifying a period of 30 days after such anticipated first delivery date
(such 30-day period, the " ** _Hamlet Payment Date Window_** ") during which
the Hamlet Payment Date will occur (such written notice, the " ** _Hamlet
First Pellets Notice_** "). Not later than 30 days prior to the Hamlet Payment
Date, Transferor shall, or shall cause Hamlet to, deliver written notice (the
" ** _Hamlet Payment Date Notice_** ") to Transferee and Wilmington of the
date within the Hamlet Payment Date Window that shall be the Hamlet Payment
Date. Transferor shall, or shall cause Hamlet to, attach to the Hamlet Payment
Date Notice a counterpart to the Hamlet-Wilmington TSA, duly executed by
Hamlet and Transferor, and upon delivery thereof to Transferee, (x) the
counterpart to the Hamlet-Wilmington TSA, duly executed by Wilmington and
delivered to Transferor pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)(vii)_, shall be released
and (y) the Hamlet-Wilmington TSA shall automatically become effective, in
each case without further action on the part of Wilmington, Hamlet or
Transferor. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 5.9_ shall
obligate Transferor to build the Source Plant. If Transferor determines in its
sole discretion to build the Source Plant, Transferor shall, or shall cause
Hamlet to, deliver written notice to Transferee and Wilmington upon
commencement of the construction thereof and shall thereafter provide
quarterly updates to Transferee and Wilmington as to the status of the
construction; _provided_ , _however_ that neither Transferor nor Hamlet shall
be obligated to prepare or deliver information that would cause undue burden
or expense. If Transferor determines in its sole discretion at any time prior
to the delivery of the Hamlet First Pellets Notice not to build the Source
Plant, Transferor shall promptly notify Transferee of such determination, and
Transferee shall thereafter have no obligation to pay the Hamlet Purchase
Price. If Transferor has not delivered the Hamlet First Pellets Notice on or
prior to December 31, 2020, then (i) Transferee shall thereafter have no
obligation to pay the Hamlet Purchase Price, (ii) the counterpart to the
Hamlet-Wilmington TSA, duly executed by Wilmington and delivered to Transferor
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)(vii)_, shall be either destroyed by Transferor or
returned to Transferee, as instructed by Transferee, and (iii) at the request
of Transferor, Transferor and Transferee shall negotiate in good faith to
enter into an agreement between Wilmington and Hamlet pursuant to which
Wilmington would provide terminal services to Hamlet consistent with the
terminal services contemplated by the Hamlet-Wilmington TSA on mutually
agreeable terms and conditions.

indemnity hereunder (the " ** _Indemnified Party_** "), such Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify the Person from whom indemnity is sought (the " **
_Indemnifying Party_** ") in writing, and the Indemnifying Party shall assume
the defense thereof, including the employment of one counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with defense thereof; _provided_ , that the failure of
any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to this Agreement, except
(and only) to the extent that it shall be finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction (which determination is not subject to appeal or
further review) that such failure shall have adversely prejudiced the
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(b) An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such Legal Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified
Party unless: (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed promptly to assume
the defense of such Legal Proceeding; or (ii) the named parties to any such
Legal Proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not

Party, effect any settlement of any pending Legal Proceeding in respect of

that are the subject matter of such Legal Proceeding and does not contain any
admission of wrongdoing or illegal conduct.

 



 

(c) All reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party that are Damages
for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder
(including reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection
with investigating or preparing to defend such Legal Proceeding in a manner
not inconsistent with this Agreement) shall be paid to the Indemnified Party,
as incurred, within ten Business Days after written notice thereof to the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , that the Indemnifying Party may require such
Indemnified Party

 



      
 

 



 

to undertake to reimburse all such fees and expenses to the extent it is
judicially determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification for such fees and expenses hereunder.

 



 

Section 7.4 **_Limitations_**.

 



 

(a) Neither Transferor nor Transferee shall be required to indemnify any
Indemnified Party for any Damages for any breach of a representation or
warranty under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ unless and until the total of all of the
Damages properly asserted against such Indemnifying Party under _Section
7.2(a)(i)_ exceeds 1% of the Closing Purchase Price, at which time the
applicable Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover the aggregate
amount of all Damages in excess of such threshold; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the aggregate liability of Transferee, on the one hand, and Transferor,
on the other hand, for indemnity for breach of a representation or warranty
under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ under this _Article VII_ shall not exceed 10% of
the Closing Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the
contrary, the limitations contemplated by this _Section 7.4(a)_ shall not
apply to any claims pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ for breach of covenant,

or willful misrepresentation or misconduct or for Damages arising out of or
relating to the breach of any Fundamental Representation or representation or
warranty of Transferor set forth in _Section 3.11_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the aggregate liability of Transferee, on the one hand, and Transferor,
on the other hand, for Damages arising out of or relating to the breach of the
Fundamental Representations or _Section 7.2(b)_ shall not exceed the Closing
Purchase Price.

 



 

(b) For purposes of determining the amount of Damages, with respect to any
asserted claim for indemnification by a Transferee Indemnitee, such
determination shall be made without regard to any qualifier as to "material,"
"materiality" or Material Adverse Effect expressly contained in _Article III_
(except in the case of the term Material Contract); _provided_ that this
_Section 7.4(b)_ shall not so modify the representations and warranties for
purposes of first determining whether a breach of any representation or
warranty has occurred.

 



 

(c) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES
EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT NEITHER TRANSFEROR NOR TRANSFEREE SHALL HAVE ANY
LIABILITY TO ANY PARTY FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
REMOTE, OR SPECULATIVE DAMAGES, SAVE AND EXCEPT SUCH DAMAGES PAYABLE WITH
RESPECT TO THIRD PARTY CLAIMS FOR WHICH SUCH INDEMNIFYING PARTY IS OBLIGATED
TO PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATION UNDER _SECTION 7.2_.

 



 

Section 7.5 **_Exclusive Remedy_**. The indemnities in _Section 5.7_ and
_Section 7.2_ shall survive Closing. The indemnities provided in _Section
5.7_, _Section 7.2_ and the provisions of _Section 9.11_ shall, from and
after Closing, be the sole and exclusive remedy of Transferee and Transferor
against one another and their respective Representatives relating to this
Agreement and the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement;
_provided_ that no limitations set forth in this _Article VII_ shall apply to
any claim for Damages arising from actual fraud, willful misconduct, criminal

rescinded.

Section 9.6 **_Disclosure Schedules_**. The inclusion of any information
(including dollar amounts) in any of the Schedules delivered by Transferor
pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the " ** _Disclosure Schedules_** ")

the Exhibits hereto and the Disclosure Schedules is disclosed solely for
purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained herein or therein
shall be deemed to be an admission by any Party hereto to any third party of
any matter whatsoever (including any violation of any Law or breach of

beneficiary of this Agreement.

the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy.

communications of any nature whatsoever relating to the Transaction, and the
method of the release for publication thereof, shall be subject to the prior
consent of each Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed by any Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall prevent a Party from publishing such press releases or other
public communications as such Party may consider necessary in order to satisfy

exchange or the Securities and Exchange Commission after consultation with the
other Party as is reasonable under the circumstances.

 



 

Section 9.13 **_Further Assurances_**. The Parties agree that, from time to
time after the Closing Date, and without any further consideration, each of
them will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, such
further agreements and instruments and take such other action as may be

deliver, acknowledge, file and record, or cause to be executed, delivered,
acknowledged, filed and recorded, such further instruments of sale,

respective successors and assigns all right, title and interest in the
Contributed Interests and the Business, or otherwise to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Documents upon the
terms and conditions set forth herein. The Parties will coordinate and
cooperate with each other in exchanging such information and assistance as any
of the Parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

 



 

Section 9.14 **_Action by Transferee_**. With respect to any amendment or
waiver under this Agreement that may be undertaken by Transferee that the
Board of Directors of the General Partner determines would give rise to a
conflict of interest, such amendment or waiver may be undertaken only by the
