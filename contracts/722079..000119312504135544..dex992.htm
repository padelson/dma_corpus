PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE COMPANY SHARES; CONSIDERATION



2.1. _Basic Transaction_. On and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and pursuant to the Plan (in the form approved by the Bankruptcy
Court), Buyer agrees to purchase from the Company, and the Company agrees to
issue and sell to Buyer, 100 Company Shares, representing 100% of the
Companys outstanding capital stock after giving effect to the Plan and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for the consideration specified
below in _Section 2.3_.



 

\- 11 - 2.2. _Deposit_. Within two (2) Business Days after the entry of an Order by
the Bankruptcy Court approving the Pre-Confirmation Protections, Buyer,
Parent and the Company shall execute and deliver the Deposit Escrow Agreement,
and Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount of cash equal to
$7,500,000 (the " _Deposit_ ") as an earnest money deposit for the
transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to _Section 11.3(a)_ , the Deposit
shall be held and disbursed pursuant to the terms of the Deposit Escrow
Agreement. Interest on the Deposit shall accrue for Buyers account. In lieu
of depositing such funds with the Escrow Agent, either in the first instance
or as a replacement therefore, Buyer or Parent may deliver an irrevocable
letter of credit in a form and issued by a bank reasonably acceptable to the
Company and the OCC (a " _Letter of Credit_ ") in a like amount to the Escrow
Agent, and if such Letter of Credit is being issued in replacement of a
Deposit previously made, the Escrow Agent shall immediately release the
Deposit and all interest accrued thereon to Buyer without further action
required by the Company.



2.3. _Consideration_.



(a) The aggregate consideration for the issuance and sale of the Company
Shares shall, subject to adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.4_ (Working
Capital Adjustment), _Section 2.5_ (Net Debt Adjustment) and _Section 2.6_
(Senior Debt Adjustment) of this Agreement consist of (the " _Purchase Price_
"):



(i) a cash payment to be delivered on the Closing Date to the Company in an
amount equal to the Closing Senior Debt less the Companys Available Cash as
of the Closing Date and less any portion of the debt under the Credit
Agreement rolled over as contemplated by Parent and Buyers
financing commitment attached hereto as _Exhibit K_ (the " _Cash Payment_ "),
_plus_



(ii) a stock payment (the " _Stock Payment_ ") to be made on the Closing Date
in the manner described in paragraph (b) below, comprised of:



(A) 250,000 shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of Old
MCC Equity pursuant to the Plan,



(B) 14,750,000 shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to certain
holders of MCC Unsecured Debt pursuant to the Plan, and



(C) shares of Parent Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference equal to
the Parent Preferred Value; provided that the aggregate liquidation
preference of such shares of Parent Preferred Stock issued pursuant to this
clause (C) shall not be less than 5,250,000 multiplied by the Closing Share
Price nor shall it be greater than 6,250,000 multiplied by the Closing Share
Price. " _Parent Preferred Value_ " means an amount equal to $120.2 million
_minus_ (1) 14,750,000 multiplied by the Closing Share Price, _minus_ (2) (if
positive) up to $10.2 million of cash proceeds realized from the sale of MPC
in the manner



 

\- 12 - contemplated by _Section 10.3(c)_ _plus_ (3) (if positive) up to $3.8 million
of cash, working capital, below market contracts or other assets contributed
to or liabilities assumed from MPC in advance of or in connection with the
sale of MPC in the manner contemplated by _Section 10.3(c)_ ; provided, that
any such contribution of assets to or assumption of liabilities from MPC is
reflected as a decrease in Closing Working Capital or an increase in Closing
Senior Debt and the Stock Payment is adjusted accordingly pursuant to
_Sections 2.4_ or _2.6_ of this Agreement. 



(iii) Any adjustments pursuant to _Sections 2.4_ , _2.5_ and _2.6_ , shall,
in the case of an increase, be made in shares of Parent Preferred Stock, and
in the case of a decrease, be allocated first to Parent Preferred Stock and
second to Parent Common Stock. For purposes of delivering any increase or
decrease in the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred
Stock, the value of shares of Parent Preferred Stock shall be based on their
liquidation preference multiplied by the Adjustment Factor, and the value of
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be based on a price per share of $6.25. No
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock shall be
issued as consideration under this Agreement. Fractional shares will be paid
in cash. 



(b) Ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company shall provide
to Buyer a reasonable estimate of the ultimate amount of the Stock Payment
after giving effect to the adjustments set forth below under _Sections 2.4_ ,
_2.5_ and _2.6_ , which estimate shall have been approved by the OCC prior to
providing it to Buyer. Such amount is referred to herein as the " _Estimated
Stock Payment_." The sum of the Post Closing Expenses and the Disputed Claims
used by the Company to calculate the Estimated Stock Payment is referred to
herein as the " _Estimated Post Closing Expenses and Disputed Claims_ ". On
the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to the Distributing Agent for
distribution to the Company Creditors in accordance with the Plan, the
Estimated Stock Payment, less the Adjustment Amount and the Holdback Amount.
Concurrently therewith, the Adjustment Amount shall be deposited with the
Adjustment Escrow Agent in accordance with the Adjustment Escrow Agreement to
cover any adjustments pursuant to _Sections 2.4_ , _2.5_ and _2.6_ and shall
be released in accordance with _Section 2.7_ , and the Holdback Amount shall
be deposited with the Holdback Escrow Agent in accordance with the Holdback
Escrow Agreement to cover Buyers indemnification rights pursuant to _Section
12.3_ hereof and shall be released in accordance with _Section 12.3_.



2.4. _Working Capital Adjustment_. As promptly as practicable after the
Closing, but no later than 45 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause
to be prepared and delivered to the OCC a statement of the calculation of
Working Capital (as defined in the Working Capital Rules) as of the end of
business on the Closing Date and giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Closing Working Capital_ "),
which statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent in all respects with
the principles and rules set forth on _Exhibit_ _F_ attached hereto (the "
_Working Capital Rules_ "). Such calculation shall be subject to verification
pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_. Buyer shall then compare the Closing Working
Capital to the



 

\- 13 - Reference Working Capital Amount. If the Reference Working Capital Amount
exceeds the amount of Closing Working Capital calculated in accordance with
the Working Capital Rules, then the Stock Payment shall be reduced by such
amount. If the Closing Working Capital is greater than the Reference Working
Capital Amount, then the Stock Payment shall be increased by such amount.



2.5. _Net Debt Adjustment_. As promptly as practicable after the Closing, but
no later than 45 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared
and delivered to the OCC a statement of the calculation of Net Debt as of the
end of business on the Closing Date. Such calculation shall be subject to
verification pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_. If Net Debt is less than negative
$1,800,000, then the Stock Payment shall be reduced by one hundred percent
(100%) of the difference. If the Net Debt is greater than
negative $1,800,000, then the Stock Payment shall be increased by an amount
equal to sixty-five percent (65%) of the increase in Net Debt, provided that
the Stock Payment shall be limited to an amount that, together with all other
adjustments pursuant to  _Section 2.4_ and _Section 2.6_ , would result in
the delivery of shares of Parent Common Stock, and Parent Preferred Stock
issued pursuant to this Agreement and the Plan in an amount such that the
number of (i) shares of Parent Common Stock, plus (ii) the aggregate
liquidation preference of the Parent Preferred Stock divided by the Closing
Share Price, is no greater than 21,000,000. " _Net Debt_ " is an amount equal
to fifty percent (50%) of (x) all current assets of Point Lisas Nitrogen
Limited (" _Point Lisas_ ") _minus_ (y) all current liabilities of Point Lisas
(other than, to avoid double-counting, Indebtedness) _minus (z)_ all
Indebtedness of Point Lisas, in each case calculated in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (" _U.S. GAAP_
"), applied in a manner consistent with the financial statements of Point
Lisas for the period ended on June 30, 2003 as previously provided to Parent.



2.6. _Senior Debt Adjustment_. As promptly as practicable after the Closing,
but no later than 45 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the OCC a statement of the calculation of Closing
Senior Debt as of the end of business on the Closing Date. There shall be
added to such calculation of Closing Senior Debt an amount equal to the net
cash proceeds (excluding any proceeds from the sale of Transferred
Subsidiaries or the assets thereof) from the sale of any material capital
asset of the Company made after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to
the Closing Date, but only to the extent such proceeds result in a decrease in
Senior Debt or an increase in the Closing Working Capital for purposes of
_Section 2.4_ or this _Section 2.6_. The sum of such net cash proceeds
(excluding any proceeds from the sale of Transferred Subsidiaries or the
assets thereof) and the Closing Senior Debt is the " _Adjusted Closing Senior
Debt_." For avoidance of doubt, material capital assets shall not include any
asset that would have been included in Closing Working Capital for purposes of
_Section 2.4_ had such asset not been sold. Such calculation shall be subject
to verification pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_. Buyer shall then compare the
Adjusted Closing Senior Debt amount to the Reference Senior Debt Amount. If
the Reference Senior Debt Amount exceeds the amount of Adjusted Closing Senior
Debt, then the Stock Payment shall be increased by such amount. If the
Adjusted Closing Senior Debt is greater than the Reference Senior Debt Amount,
then the Stock Payment shall be reduced by such amount. " _Closing Senior
Debt_ " means all amounts owed by the Company with respect to the Senior Debt
plus the Claims and the Estimated Post Closing Expenses and Disputed Claims.



 

\- 14 - 2.7. _Adjustments_.



(a) If based on the calculations delivered by Buyer pursuant to _Sections 2.4_
, _2.5_ and  _2.6_ , the Stock Payment exceeds the portion of the Stock
Payment delivered to the Distributing Agent for distribution to the Company
Creditors pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ , Buyer shall, within one (1) Business
Day of delivering such calculations, deliver or cause the Adjustment Escrow
Agent to deliver to the Distributing Agent for distribution to the Company
Creditors such excess in Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock in
accordance with _Section 2.3(a)(iii)_. The calculations provided by Buyer
pursuant to _Sections 2.4_ , _2.5_ or _2.6_ , shall be subject to the
verification procedures by the OCC as described in this _Section 2.7(a)_.
Within 20 days after receipt thereof, the OCC may request a "Big Four"
auditing firm selected by the OCC and reasonably acceptable to Buyer (the "
_Verifier_ ") to assess the accuracy of Buyers calculations. Parent and Buyer
agree to provide the Verifier with all information and materials in its
possession as shall be necessary in connection therewith. If the OCC agrees
with Buyers calculations, the OCC does not request verification within 20
days of receiving Buyers calculations or the Verifier confirms Buyers
calculations, Buyers calculations shall become final and the Parent Common
Stock and Parent Preferred Stock, if any, held by the Adjustment Escrow Agent
after making the distribution required by the first sentence of this 
_Section 2.7(a)_ shall be distributed to Buyer. If the Verifier disagrees with
any of Buyers calculations, the Verifier shall so notify the OCC and Buyer
and the Verifiers calculations shall, unless objected to by Buyer within
20 days of receipt by Buyer, become final. If Buyer objects to any portion of
Verifiers calculations, such portion of Verifiers calculations shall be
submitted to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration procedures set
forth in  _Exhibit G_ (the " _Arbitration Procedures_ "). Upon the Verifiers
calculations becoming final or the conclusion of an arbitration in accordance
with this _Section 2.7(a)_ , Buyer shall deliver or cause the Adjustment
Escrow Agent to deliver to the Distributing Agent for distribution to the
Company Creditors Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock in accordance
with _Section 2.3(a)(iii)_ sufficient so that the sum of all payments made to
the Distributing Agent in respect of the Stock Payment pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)_ and this _Section 2.7(a)_ equal to the final Stock Payment and the
Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock, if any, held by the Adjustment
Escrow Agent after making such payment shall be distributed to Buyer.



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, through the
making of the Stock Payment, all references in this Agreement to and
calculations of the Closing Share Price and the limitations on the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock specified in the
calculation of the Stock Payment shall be appropriately adjusted so that the
Company Creditors receive comparable value in the event the Parent Common
Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a
different number or kind of shares or securities through any reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split, or other like changes in Parents capitalization.



(c) In no event shall the Purchase Price be increased if the total Post
Closing Expenses and Disputed Claims exceeds the Estimated Post Closing
Expenses and Disputed Claims. However, if the Estimated Post Closing Expenses
and Disputed Claims



 

\- 15 - exceed the total Post Closing Expenses and Disputed Claims, the Company shall,
at the direction of the OCC, pay the excess to the Distributing Agent for
distribution to the Company Creditors in accordance with the Plan.

TERMINATION AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION



11.1.  _Right of Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

give notice to the other party specifying the provision pursuant to which the
Agreement is being terminated.



11.2. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time before
Closing:



(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Buyer; 



(b) by Buyer or the Company, on any date that is more than 180 days after the

or before such date; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Buyer nor the
Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
11.2(b)_ if such partys failure to fulfill any of its obligations under this
Agreement is the reason that the Closing has not occurred on or before such
date (a " _Termination Date Event_ ");



(c) by Buyer, if there shall be a breach by the Company of any representation
or warranty, or any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement which
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 10.3_ and which

Business Days after the giving of written notice by Buyer to the Company of
such breach and (B) the Termination Date (a " _Company Breach Termination

\- 51 - the Holdback Escrow Agreement or the Adjustment Escrow Agreement invalid or
unenforceable in any material respect or that prevents the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (a " _Termination Order_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor Buyer shall have the

Court contemplated by _Section 8.1_ hereof approving the Pre-Confirmation

(h) by the Company, in order to enter into any agreement concerning or to
consummate a Superior Proposal. 



11.3. _Effect of Failure of Conditions to Closing; Break-Up Fee_.

entitled to seek any other remedies conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and none of the Company, its Subsidiaries and Non-Controlled
Subsidiaries, Buyer or any of its respective Related Persons shall have any
liability or obligation arising under or in connection with this Agreement.

Termination Event: (i) the Deposit, together with any interest accrued
thereon less any fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent, shall be returned to
Buyer or the Letter of Credit shall be released, as applicable, (ii) this
Agreement shall become null and void and have no effect (other than _Article
11_ and _Article 12_ , which shall survive termination), and (iii) except as
provided in this _Section 11.3_ , none of the Company or its Subsidiaries, nor
Buyer or any of its respective Related Persons shall have any liability or
obligation arising under or in connection with this Agreement.



(c) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) Buyer pursuant to _Section 11.2(c)_
as a result of a Company Breach Termination Event (other than under _Section
8.1_ ) resulting from a Material Adverse Effect or by the Company pursuant to
_Section 11.2(h)_ in connection with a Superior Proposal, then the Company
will promptly pay to Buyer in immediately available funds a cash fee equal to
$8,400,000 (the " _Break-Up Fee_ ").



(d) If this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section 11.2(c)_ as
a result of a Company Breach Termination Event (other than _Section 8.1_ ),
then, subject to _Section 11.3(j)_ , the Company will promptly reimburse
Buyer for all Transaction Expenses up to $2,000,000. If this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 11.2(h)_ in connection with a
Superior Proposal, then _Section 11.3(j)_ , the Company will promptly
reimburse Buyer for all Transaction Expenses up to $4,000,000.



 

\- 52 - (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
the Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 11.2(b)_ , and at the time
of such termination there did not exist a failure by the Company to fulfill
its obligations under _Section 6.1_ , then the Company shall have no
obligation to pay a Break-Up Fee to Parent or Buyer or reimburse any
Transaction Expenses.



(f) In the event the Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to _Section
11.2(c)_ as a result of a failure by the Company to satisfy the condition
specified in _Section 10.3(c)_ despite the Companys commercially reasonable
efforts, then the Company shall have no obligation to pay a Break-Up Fee to
Parent or Buyer or reimburse any Transaction Expenses.



(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event Buyer or
Parent shall become obligated to pay or has paid any fees or expenses to any
financing source that shall fail to provide such financing for any reason
other than the Companys breach of this Agreement, the Company shall have no
obligation hereunder to reimburse Buyer or Parent, and the term "Transaction
Expenses" shall not be read to include such fees and/or expenses.



(h) In the event the Closing does not occur and the Company pays the
Transaction Expenses pursuant to _Section 11.3(d)_ , and the Break-Up Fee
pursuant to _Section 11.3(c)_ , if applicable, the availability of such remedy
shall serve as the exclusive remedy available to Parent and Buyer for breach
of this Agreement by the Company and, notwithstanding any provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer and Parent shall not be entitled to
seek any other remedies conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party,
and none of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall have any liability or
obligation arising under or in connection with this Agreement.



(i) The Companys obligation to pay the Break-Up Fee and Transaction Expenses
shall survive termination of this Agreement and shall constitute an
administrative expense of the Company under section 364(c)(1) of the
Bankruptcy Code with priority over any and all administrative expenses of the
kind specified in Section 503(b) or 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.



(j) For avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that the Company, Buyer and
Parent shall have no liability to the others if the Agreement is terminated
by Buyer because the Company shall not have obtained an Order approving the
Pre-Confirmation Protections from the Bankruptcy Court.



ARTICLE 12

MISCELLANEOUS 



12.1. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and shall be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the parties
hereto. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no party hereto shall
assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the other party hereto, and any such attempted
assignment without such prior written consent shall be void and of no force
and effect;



 

\- 53 - provided, however, Buyer may assign its rights (but not its or Parents
obligations) under this Agreement to a Permitted Assignee and Buyer or any
Permitted Assignee may assign its rights hereunder to Buyers financing
sources for purposes of collateral security. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and shall be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of
the parties hereto.



12.2. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be construed,
performed and enforced in accordance with, and governed by, the Laws of the
State of Delaware (without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of
Laws thereof), except to the extent that the Laws of such State are
superseded by the Bankruptcy Code. For so long as the Company is subject to
the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, the parties hereto irrevocably elect
as the sole judicial forum for the adjudication of any matters arising under
or in connection with the Agreement, and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction
of, the Bankruptcy Court. After the Company is no longer subject to the
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, any legal action or proceeding
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be
brought in the courts of the State of Delaware sitting in Delaware or of the
United States for the State of Delaware, and by execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each of the parties consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
those courts. Each of the parties irrevocably waives any objection, including
any objection to the laying of venue or based on the grounds of _forum non
conveniens_ , which it may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any
action or proceeding in such jurisdiction in respect of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.



12.3. _Indemnification_. Subject to _Section 12.4_ , at the end of the
Holdback Period, Buyer will calculate the amount of any actual or reasonably
anticipated out-of-pocket losses, Liabilities, obligations, damages, costs and
expenses arising or resulting from any breach by the Company of its
representations, warranties or covenants in this Agreement and all actions,
suits, proceedings, claims, demands, assessments, judgments, costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incident to the foregoing
(individually, a " _Post-Closing Loss_ " and collectively, " _Post-
Closing Losses_ "). Within five (5) Business Days after the last day of the
Holdback Period, Buyer shall (i) provide to the OCC a detailed schedule of
such Post-Closing Losses and a description of the facts and circumstances
pursuant to which Buyer asserts that it is entitled to recourse from the
Holdback Amount pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) direct the Holdback Escrow
Agent to release to Distribution Agent for distribution to the Company
Creditors the Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock (or redemption
proceeds) which is in excess of the amount which would have an aggregate
value, determined in the manner specified in Section 2.3(a)(iii), equal to
such estimated Post-Closing Losses based on the liquidation preference of the
Parent Preferred Stock and the Closing Share Price of Parent Common Stock.
Buyer shall also provide any reasonable supporting documentation requested by
the OCC to facilitate its review of such schedule. The OCC shall have twenty
(20) business days to review such schedule, description and supporting
documentation and provide written notice of any objections to any Post-Closing
Loss (or the basis therefore or calculation thereof) set forth therein. If
Buyer and the OCC cannot agree on the amount of any such Post-Closing Loss,
the calculation thereof shall be subject to arbitration in accordance with the
Arbitration Procedures. Within five (5) Business Days of such determination of
the Post-Closing Losses, Buyer shall advise the Holdback Escrow Agent of the
amount of Post-Closing Losses and the Holdback Escrow Agent shall release to
Buyer such amount of Parent Preferred Stock (or redemption proceeds), and to
the extent necessary, Parent Common Stock in the manner specified in



 

\- 54 - _Section 2.3(a)(iii)_ , with an aggregate value equal to such Post-Closing
Losses based on the liquidation preference of the Parent Preferred Stock and
the Closing Share Price of Parent Common Stock. The remainder of the Holdback
Amount, if any, shall simultaneously be released to the Distributing Agent for
the Company Creditors in accordance with the Holdback Escrow Agreement.



12.4. _Limitation on Indemnification_. Buyer shall not claim any Post-Closing
Losses pursuant to _Section 12.3_ unless and to the extent the aggregate
amount of such Post-Closing Losses exceeds $2,000,000 in the aggregate;
provided that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any Post-Closing
Loss arising from, or related to, a breach of any covenant of the Company.
Whether or not the Closing shall occur, other than against the Holdback Amount
pursuant to _Section 12.3_ hereof, neither Parent nor Buyer shall have any
recourse against any stockholder, creditor, employee, agent, officer or
director of the Company or against the OCC or its members or agents. In the
event the Closing shall occur, Buyers sole and exclusive remedy for any
breach of this Agreement shall be by recourse to the Holdback Amount pursuant
to _Section 12.3_.



12.5. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Buyer and
Parent shall give reasonably prompt notice to the other party of (i) the
occurrence or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence,
of which would be likely to cause (x) any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate, in any material respect, or (y)
any covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement not
be complied with or satisfied, in any material respect; and (ii) any failure
or inability of such party to comply, in any material respect, with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder. 



12.6. _Mutual Drafting_. This Agreement is the result of the joint efforts of
Buyer, Parent and the Company, and each provision hereof has been subject to
the mutual consultation, negotiation and agreement of the parties and there is
to be no construction against either party based on any presumption of that
partys involvement in the drafting thereof.



12.7. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein, each of the parties
hereto shall pay its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the

the parties hereto, be the responsibility of the other party.

effecting the closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, upon the Buyer or Parents request, the Company
shall, at the Closing, execute and deliver such documents as are necessary or
desirable to effect the transfer of one or more assets of the
Company directly to Buyer, Parent or any of Parents subsidiaries; provided,
however, that such transfers shall not result in any adjustments to the
Purchase Price, whether under _Sections 2.4_ , _2.5_ , _2.6_ or otherwise.



 

\- 55 - 12.10. _Severability_. In the event that any part of this Agreement is
declared by any court or other judicial or administrative body to be null,
void or unenforceable, said provision shall survive to the extent it is not so
declared, and all of the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
