writing at least 2 Business Days prior to the  Closing Date) and the
Purchaser hereby agrees to purchase from the Vendor,  on the Closing Date,

      |  

The purchase price for the Purchased Shares shall be the  sum of $200,000,000
(the "Purchase Price") plus or minus, as  applicable, the Adjustment Amount.
The Purchase Price shall be payable by  the Purchaser to the Vendor on

of the Purchase Price may be paid  in common shares of the Purchaser
("Payment Shares") at a deemed  issue price of $9.06 per share. The portion
of the Purchase Price payable  for the Minority Shares shall be paid in cash

      |   | 
    2.3   |  

Adjustment Amount and Contingent Payments 

      |   | 
      |  

The Adjustment Amount shall be paid by (i) the Vendor (if  the Adjustment

Adjustment Amount is positive) to the Vendor in each case in the  manner and
the time provided in Section 2.4 and to  such account or accounts as the

As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and in  any event within
sixty (60) days of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall  prepare and deliver
to Vendor the Statement of Adjustments together with a  certificate executed
by the Purchaser certifying that the information  contained in the Statement
of Adjustments is true and complete and fairly  reflects the information
contained in the accounting records of Mexgold  (on a consolidated basis) as
of the Closing Date. The Vendor shall have  twenty (20) days following
receipt of any Statement of Adjustments to  complete a review of such
Statement of Adjustments. If the Vendor disputes  the accuracy of all or any
part of the Statement of Adjustments, or any of  them, it shall deliver,
within a further period of ten (10) days following  completion of such review
of the Statement of Adjustments by the Vendor,  notice of such dispute to the
Purchaser, which notice shall include a  reasonably detailed explanation of

of the Statement of Adjustments,  the Statement of Adjustments will be
binding and conclusive on the Parties  and be used in calculating the
Adjustment Amount. 

          | (b)   |  

In the event of a dispute in respect of the Statement of  Adjustments, the
Chief Financial Officer of each of the Vendor and the  Purchaser shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. In the  event that the Chief
Financial Officers are unable to resolve the dispute  within ten (10) days,
they shall promptly submit such dispute to a  mutually agreed upon and
nationally recognized independent accounting firm  which does not audit the
financial statements of, or provide tax,  consulting or other services to,
either the Purchaser or the Vendor or any  of their Affiliates. If the Vendor
and the Purchaser cannot agree to the  selection of an accounting firm within
a further period of five (5) days,  the Vendors and the Purchasers existing
auditors shall mutually select  an independent accounting firm (in each case
as so selected, the  "Auditor"). The Auditor shall be instructed to deliver
as soon as  practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days, a decision
in  writing in respect of such dispute or disagreement on the basis of the 
information provided to it. The Auditors decision in respect of such 
dispute shall be final and binding on the Parties hereto, without any  right
of appeal, and shall deal with the issue of costs of resolving such  dispute
and all matters related thereto. The Purchaser and Vendor will  each bear
fifty percent (50%) of the fees and costs of the Auditor  incurred in
connection with its decision. 

      |   |   | 
      | (c)   |  

If the Statement of Adjustments shows a Working Capital  that is greater than
nil (positive) the Purchase Price shall be adjusted  upward by the amount by
which the Working Capital exceeds nil. If the  Statement of Adjustments shows
a Working Capital that is less than nil  (negative) the Purchase Price shall
be adjusted downward by the amount by  which the Working Capital exceeds nil. 

      |   |   |

nil (positive) the Purchaser shall within two (2)  Business Days following

representatives of the Adjustment Statements in accordance  with section

above, of any  dispute that may arise in respect of the Adjustment Statements
(the  "Adjustment Date"), pay to the Vendor, as an adjustment  to the
Purchase Price, an amount equal to the amount by which the Working  Capital

      | (e)   |  

If the Statement of Adjustments shows a Working Capital  that is less than
nil (negative) the Vendor shall within two (2) Business  Days following the

referred to  in paragraphs 2.5(a)(ii) to 2.5(a)(iv) above shall be suspended

      | (e)   |  

The Vendor acknowledges that the Purchaser intends to  establish a credit
facility secured by the Purchasers existing  operating mines from which
facility the Purchaser will arrange for  Contingent Payments to be made. For

by mutual written agreement of the Purchaser and the  Vendor; 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

by either the Vendor or the Purchaser, if the Closing  Date has not occurred
on or prior to the Outside Date except that the  right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 14.1(b) shall not be available to any Party
whose  failure to fulfill any of its obligations or breach of any of its

or resulted in, the failure of the Closing Date to occur by such Outside 
Date; 

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

by Vendor if any of the any of the conditions set forth  in Section 12.1 is

this Agreement so as to  cause any of the conditions set forth in Section
11.1 not to be satisfied; 

      |   | 
      | (d)   |  

by the Purchaser if any of the any of the conditions set  forth in Section

      |   | 
      | (e)   |  

subject to Section 14.2, by the  Purchaser by written notice to the Vendor if

or incorrect or shall  have become untrue or incorrect such that the

satisfaction, or (ii) the Vendor is in default in any material respect of 
any of its covenants or obligations herein such that the condition in

the conditions set forth in Section  12.1 not to be satisfied; and 

      |   | 
      | (f)   |  

subject to Section 14.2, by the  Vendor by written notice to the Purchaser if

untrue or incorrect or shall  have become untrue or incorrect such that the
condition contained in  subsection 12.1(a) would be incapable of 
satisfaction, or (ii) the Purchaser is in default in any material respect  of
any of its covenants or obligations herein such that the condition in

that the Vendor is not then in breach  of this Agreement so as to cause any
of the conditions set forth in  Section 11.1 not to be satisfied. 

        14.2   |  

Cure Period 

      |   | 
      |  

Each Party shall give prompt notice to the other of the  occurrence, or
failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until  the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement and the Closing  Time of any event
or state of facts which occurrence or failure would, or  would be likely to: 

      |   | 
      | (a)   |  

cause any of the representations or warranties of any  Party contained herein
to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect on the  date hereof or at the
Closing Time; or 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any  covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any  Party hereunder prior to
the Closing. 

      |   |     |   |  

The Purchaser may not exercise its right to terminate  this Agreement
pursuant to Section 14.1(e) and  Vendor may not exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  Section 14.1(f) unless the Party
intending to rely  thereon has delivered a written notice to the other Party
specifying in  reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations
and  warranties or other matters which the Party delivering such notice is 
asserting as the basis for the non-fulfilment or the applicable condition  or
termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice is delivered, 
provided that a Party is proceeding diligently to cure such matter and  such
matter is capable of being cured, no Party may terminate this  Agreement
until the expiration of a period of fifteen (15) Business Days  from such
notice, and then only if such matter has not been cured by such  date. For
greater certainty, in the event that such matter is cured within  the time
period referred to herein without a Material Adverse Effect or  Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect, this Agreement may not be terminated as  a result of
the cured breach. 

      |   | 
    14.3   |  

Effect of Termination 

      |   | 
      | (a)   |

(other than pursuant to Section 14.1(a) shall give written notice of such
termination  to the other Party. 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 14.1, this Agreement shall
become void and of no  effect without liability of any Party (or any
shareholder, director,  officer, employee, agent, consultant or
representative of such Party) to  any other Party hereto, except as otherwise
expressly contemplated hereby,  and provided that the provisions of this
Section 14.3(b) and 14.3(c) and  Sections 16.1, 17.2, 17.4,  17.6 to 17.11
(inclusive) as well as the  Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any

      |   | 
      | (c)   |  

Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement by the  Vendor pursuant to
any of subsection 14.1(b),  subsection 14.1(c) or subsection 14.1(f), the
Vendor may bring an action against the  Purchaser for damages suffered by the
Vendor where the non- performance,  non-fulfillment or non-compliance of or
with the relevant condition is a  result of a breach of covenant,
representation or warranty by the  Purchaser. 

      |   | 
      | (d)   |  

Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement by the  Purchaser pursuant
to any of subsection 14.1(b),  subsection 14.1(d) or subsection 14.1(e) the

      |   | 
      | (c)   |

or more claims for Losses made against the Vendor by a  Purchaser Indemnified
Party under Section 15.1 hereof shall be limited to  Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000); 

      |   | 
      | (d)   |  

for greater certainty, the limitations in this Section  15.2 shall have no
application to any claim for Losses made by a Purchaser  Indemnified Party

      |   |     | 15.4   |

Notice of Third Party Claims 

      |   | 
      |  

If an Indemnified Party receives notice of the  commencement or assertion of
any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party  shall give the Indemnifier
reasonably prompt notice thereof ("Third  Party Claim Notice"), but in any
event no later than 30 days after  receipt of written notice of such Third
Party Claim. The Third Party Claim  Notice shall describe the Third Party
Claim in reasonable detail and shall  indicate, if reasonably practicable,
the estimated amount of the Loss that  has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The omission so to  notify the Indemnifier shall not
relieve the Indemnifier from any duty to  indemnify and hold harmless which
otherwise might exist with respect to  such cause unless (and only to that
extent) the omission to notify  materially prejudices the ability of the
Indemnifier to exercise its right  to defend as provided in this Article 15. 

      |   | 
    15.6   |  

Defence of Third Party Claims 

      |   | 
      |  

The Indemnifier may participate in or assume the defence  of such Third Party
Claim by giving notice ("Defence Notice") to  that effect to the Indemnified
Party not later than 30 days after  receiving the Third Party Claim Notice
(the "Defence Period"). The  Indemnifiers right to do so shall be subject to
the rights of any insurer  or other third party who has potential liability
in respect of that Third  Party Claim. The Indemnifier shall pay all of its
own expenses of  participating in or assuming such defence. The Indemnified
Party shall co  operate in good faith in the defence of each Third Party
Claim, even if  the defence has been assumed by the Indemnifier and may
participate in  such defence assisted by counsel of its own choice at its
own  expense. 

      |   | 
    15.7   |  

Assistance for Third Party Claims 

      |   | 
      |  

The Indemnifier and the Indemnified Party shall use all  reasonable efforts
to make available to the Party which is undertaking and  controlling the
defence of any Third Party Claim (the "Defending  Party") 

      |   | 
      | (a)   |  

those employees whose assistance, testimony or presence  is necessary to
assist the Defending Party in evaluating and in defending  any Third Party
Claim, and 

      |   | 
      | (b)   |  

all documents, records and other materials in the  possession of such Party
reasonably required by the Defending Party for  its use in defending any
Third Party Claim, subject to confidentiality and  solicitor-client
privilege, 

      |   |     |   |  

and shall otherwise co operate with the Defending Party.  The Indemnifier
shall be responsible for all reasonable expenses  associated with making such
documents, records and materials available,  and for all reasonable expenses
of any employees made available by the  Indemnified Party to the Indemnifier
hereunder, which expense shall not  exceed the actual cost to the Indemnified
Party associated with such  employees. 

      |   | 
    15.8   |  

Settlement of Third Party Claims 

      |   | 
      |  

If an Indemnifier elects to assume the defence of any  Third Party Claim as
provided in Section 15.6 the Indemnifier shall not be  liable for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defence of  such Third Party Claim. However, if the Indemnifier fails to
take  reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party
Claim  within 30 days after receiving notice from the Indemnified Party that
the  Indemnified Party _bona fide_ believes on reasonable grounds that the 
Indemnifier has failed to take such steps, the Indemnified Party may, at  its
option, elect to assume the defence of and to compromise or settle the  Third
Party Claim assisted by counsel of its own choosing and the  Indemnifier
shall be liable for all reasonable costs and expenses paid or  incurred in
connection therewith. Without the prior written consent of the  Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifier shall not enter into or cause any  compromise or
settlement of any Third Party Claim unless: 

         |  

(a)

  | the Indemnified Party receives, as part of  the compromise and
settlement, a legally binding and enforceable  unconditional satisfaction or
release, which is in form and substance  satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party, acting reasonably; and 
      |   |     |   |  

(b)

  | the Third Party Claim and any claim or  liability of the Indemnified
Party with respect thereto is being fully  satisfied because of the
compromise and settlement and the Indemnified  Party is being released from
any and all obligations or liabilities it may  have with respect to the Third
Party Claim and any claim or liability  which may arise in respect thereof to
other Persons as a result of the  claim being asserted against such other
Persons by the Person making the  Third Party Claim. 
      |   |     | 15.9   |  

Failure to Give Timely Notice 

      |   | 
      | A failure to give timely notice as provided in  this Article 15
shall not affect the rights or obligations of any Party  except and only to
the extent that, as a result of such failure, any Party  which was entitled
to receive such notice was deprived of its right to  recover any payment
under its applicable insurance coverage or was  otherwise directly and
materially damaged as a result of such  failure. 
      |   | 
    15.10   |  

Reductions and Subrogation 

      |   | 
      |  

If the amount of any Loss incurred by an Indemnified  Party at any time
subsequent to the making of an Indemnity Payment is  reduced by any recovery,
settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to any  insurance coverage, or
pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or  payment by or against any
other Person, the amount of such reduction (less  any costs, expenses
(including taxes) or premiums incurred in connection  therewith), together
with interest thereon from the date of payment  thereof at the Prime Rate,
shall promptly be repaid by the Indemnified  Party to the Indemnifier. Upon
making a full Indemnity Payment, the  Indemnifier shall, to the extent of
such Indemnity Payment, be subrogated  to all rights of the Indemnified Party
against any third party that is not  an Affiliate of the Indemnified Party in
respect of the Loss to which the  Indemnity Payment relates but only if the
Indemnifier shall then be in  compliance with its obligations under this
Agreement in respect of such  Loss. Until the Indemnified Party recovers full
payment of its Loss, any  and all Claims of the Indemnifier against any such
third party on account  of such Indemnity Payment shall be postponed and
subordinated in right of  payment to the Indemnified Partys rights against
such third party.  Without limiting the generality or effect of any other
provision hereof,  the Indemnified Party and Indemnifier shall duly execute
upon request all  instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect
such postponement  and subordination. 

        15.11   |  

Payment and Interest 

      |   | 
      | (a)   |  

All amounts to be paid by an Indemnifier pursuant to this  Article 15 shall
bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Prime  Rate, calculated and
payable monthly, both before and after judgment, with  interest on overdue
interest at the same rate, from the date that the  Indemnified Party
disbursed funds, suffered damages or losses or incurred  a loss, liability or
expense in respect of a Loss for which the  Indemnifier is liable to make
payment pursuant to this Article 15, to the  date of payment by the
Indemnifier to the Indemnified Party.
