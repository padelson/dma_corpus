 **SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT**

 



 

This Share Exchange Agreement (this " ** _Agreement_** ") is made and entered
into as of December [__], 2017, by and among (i) **Resort Savers, Inc.** , a
corporation incorporated in the State of Nevada (the " ** _Purchaser_** "),
(ii) **Dusun Eco Resort (2015) Sdn. Bhd.** , a [limited liability company]
incorporated in Malaysia (the " ** _Company_** ") and (iii) each of the
shareholders of the Company named on Annex I hereto (collectively, the " **
_Sellers_** "). The Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers are sometimes
referred to herein individually as a " ** _Party_** " and, collectively, as
the " ** _Parties_**." Capitalized terms, unless otherwise defined, shall have
the meanings ascribed to such terms in _Article XII_ hereof.

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Purchaser is a publicly held corporation organized under
the laws of the State of Nevada;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Company is a privately-held limited liability company
organized under the laws of Malaysia, and has no Subsidiaries;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Sellers collectively own all of the issued and outstanding
equity shares of the Company representing a 100% interest in the Company;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Purchaser agrees to acquire 100% of the issued and
outstanding equity shares of the Company from the Sellers in exchange for the
issuance of 400,000,000 shares of the Purchaser's common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share (the " ** _Common Stock_** "), which shall represent
approximately 84.21% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Purchaser's
Common Stock (the " ** _Exchange_** ") and on the Closing Date (as defined
below), the Sellers will become stockholders of the Purchaser; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Exchange qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the premises set forth above, which
are incorporated in this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as
follows:

 



 

 ** **ARTICLE I.****

 

 **THE SHARE EXCHANGE**

 



 

 **1.1 Purchase and Sale of Shares**. At the Closing and subject to and upon
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Sellers shall sell, transfer,
convey, assign and deliver to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase,
acquire and accept from the Sellers, all of the issued and outstanding shares
(being 100 shares of [Rm 1.00] par value each) of the Company (collectively,
the " ** _Purchased Shares_** "), free and clear of all Liens (other than
potential restrictions on resale under applicable securities Laws).

 



 

 **1.2** **Consideration**. At the Closing and subject to and upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, in full payment for the Purchased Shares,
the Purchaser shall issue and deliver to the Sellers an aggregate of
400,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the " ** _Exchange Shares_** "). Each
Seller shall receive its pro rata share of the Exchange Shares based on the
percentage of Purchased Shares owned by such Seller as compared to the total
number of Purchased Shares owned by all Sellers (such Seller's " ** _Pro Rata
Share_** "). Each Seller's Pro Rata Share is set forth in _Annex I_.

 

     
--- 
   
   


   

 



 

 **1.3** **Company Shareholder Consent**. Each Seller, as a shareholder of the
Company, hereby approves, authorizes and consents to the Company's execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its
obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the consents set
forth herein are intended and shall constitute such consent of the Sellers as
may be required (and shall, if applicable, operate as a written shareholder
resolution of the Company) pursuant to the Company Charter, any other
agreement in respect of the Company to which any Seller is a party and all
applicable Laws.

 



 

 ** **ARTICLE II.****

 

 **CLOSING**

 



 

 **2.1** **Closing**. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (" ** _Closing_** ") shall occur at a mutually agreeable time and
place within five business days after all the closing conditions to this
Agreement have been satisfied or waived, or at such other date, time or place
as the Purchaser and the Company may agree (the date of such Closing, the " **
_Closing Date_** ").

 



 

 ** **ARTICLE III.****

 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER**

 



 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered by the Purchaser to
the Company on the date hereof (the " ** _Purchaser Disclosure Schedules_**
"), the Section numbers of which are numbered to correspond to the Section
numbers of this Agreement to which they refer, or in the SEC Reports (as
defined below), the Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company, as
follows:

 



 

 **3.1** **Due Organization and Good Standing**. The Purchaser is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Nevada. The Purchaser has all requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted. The Purchaser is duly qualified or licensed
and in good standing to conduct business in each jurisdiction in which the
character of the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for any deviations from any of the foregoing that would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Purchaser. The Purchaser
has heretofore made available to the Company accurate and complete copies of
the Purchaser Charter, as currently in effect.

 



 

 **3.2** **Authorization; Binding Agreement**. The Purchaser has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform the Purchaser's obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (a) have been
duly and validly authorized by the board of directors of the Purchaser, and
(b) no other corporate proceedings, other than as set forth elsewhere in the
Agreement, on the part of the Purchaser are necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Purchaser and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the other Parties hereto, constitutes the valid
and binding obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability thereof
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and
moratorium laws and other laws of general application affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by any applicable statute of
limitation or by any valid defense of set-off or counterclaim, and the fact
that equitable remedies or relief (including the remedy of specific
performance) are subject to the discretion of the court from which such relief
may be sought (collectively, the " ** _Enforceability Exceptions_** ").

 

     
--- 
  -2- 
   


   

 



 

 **3.3** **Governmental Approvals**. No Consent of or with any Governmental
Authority, on the part of the Purchaser is required to be obtained or made in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance by the Purchaser of
this Agreement or the consummation by the Purchaser of the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than (a) such filings as may be required by the
State of Nevada to consummate and report mergers, share exchanges or similar
corporate combination or reorganization transactions, (b) such filings as may
be required in any jurisdiction where the Purchaser is qualified or authorized
to conduct business as a foreign corporation in order to maintain such
qualification or authorization, (c) such filings as contemplated by this
Agreement, (d) any filings required with the OTC Markets Group with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (e) applicable requirements,
if any, of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and/or any state "blue sky"
securities Laws, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and (f) where the
failure to obtain or make such Consents or to make such filings or
notifications, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Purchaser.

 



 

 **3.4** **No Conflict With Other Instruments**. The execution and delivery by
the Purchaser of this Agreement, the consummation by the Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and compliance by the Purchaser with any of
the provisions hereof will not result in the breach of any term or provision
of, constitute a default under, or terminate, accelerate or modify the terms
of, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, or other material agreement or
instrument to which the Purchaser is a party or to which any of its assets,
properties or operations are subject, except to the extent that such breach
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Purchaser.

 



 

 **3.5** **Capitalization**.

 



 

(a) The Purchaser is authorized to issue (i) 1,000,000,000 shares of Common
Stock, of which 74,976,241 are issued and outstanding prior to the Closing,
and (ii) 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share,
none of which are issued and outstanding prior to the Closing. All outstanding
shares of Common Stock are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any purchase
option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any
similar right under any provision of the NRS, the Purchaser Charter or any
Contract to which the Purchaser is a party. None of the outstanding Common
Stock has been issued in violation of any applicable securities Laws.

 



 

(b) Prior to giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except as set forth in the SEC Reports or in this Agreement, the Purchaser
does not have any Subsidiaries or own any equity interests in any other
Person.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in the SEC Reports, there are no (i) outstanding
options, warrants, puts, calls, convertible securities, preemptive or similar
rights, (ii) bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness having general
voting rights or that are convertible or exchangeable into securities having
such rights or (iii) subscriptions or other rights, agreements, arrangements,
Contracts or commitments of any character (A) relating to the issued or
unissued shares of the Purchaser, or (B) obligating the Purchaser to issue,
transfer, deliver or sell or cause to be issued, transferred, delivered, sold
or repurchased any options or shares or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such shares, or (C) obligating the Purchaser to grant, extend
or enter into any such option, warrant, call, subscription or other right,
agreement, arrangement or commitment for such capital shares. Other than as
expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the SEC Reports, there are no
outstanding obligations of the Purchaser to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any shares of the Purchaser or to provide funds to make any investment
(in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any Person, and
there are no stockholders agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which the Purchaser is a party with respect to the voting of
any shares of the Purchaser.

Indebtedness of the Purchaser contains any restriction upon: (i) the
prepayment of any of such Indebtedness, (ii) the incurrence of Indebtedness by
the Purchaser or (iii) the ability of the Purchaser to grant any Lien on its
properties or assets.

 



 

(e) Since January 1, 2015, and except as contemplated by this Agreement or
disclosed in the SEC Reports, the Purchaser has not declared or paid any
distribution or dividend in respect of its shares and has not repurchased,
redeemed or otherwise acquired any of its shares, and the Purchaser's board of
directors has not authorized any of the foregoing.

Agreement to which they refer, the Sellers hereby jointly and severally
represent and warrant to the Purchaser as follows:

 



 

 **5.1** **Due Organization and Good Standing**. Each Seller, if not an

standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its formation and has all
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted.

 



 

 **5.2** **Authorization; Binding Agreement**. Each Seller has all requisite
power, authority and legal right and capacity to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform such Seller's obligations hereunder and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by such Seller and assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the other parties hereto,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Seller,
enforceable against such Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions.

 

     
--- 
  -21- 
   


   

 



 

 **5.3** **Ownership**. Sellers own good, valid and marketable title to the
Purchased Shares, free and clear of any and all Liens, with each Seller owning
the Purchased Shares set forth on _Annex I_. There are no proxies, voting
rights, shareholders' agreements or other agreements or understandings, to
which a Seller is a party or by which a Seller is bound, with respect to the
voting or transfer of any of such Seller's Purchased Shares other than this
Agreement. Upon delivery of the Purchased Shares to the Purchaser on the
Closing Date in accordance with this Agreement, the entire legal and
beneficial interest in the Purchased Shares and good, valid and marketable
title to the Purchased Shares, free and clear of all Liens (other than those
imposed by applicable securities Laws or those incurred by the Purchaser),
will pass to the Purchaser.

 



 

 **5.4** **Governmental Approvals**. No Consent of or with any Governmental
Authority on the part of any Seller is required to be obtained or made in
connection with the execution, delivery or performance by such Seller of this
Agreement or the consummation by a Seller of the transactions contemplated
hereby other than such filings as expressly contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **5.5** **Non-Contravention**. The execution and delivery by each Seller of
this Agreement, the consummation by each Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and compliance by each Seller with any of the provisions
hereof will not result in the breach of any term or provision of, constitute a
default under, or terminate, accelerate or modify the terms of, any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, or other material agreement or instrument to which
each Seller is a party or to which any of its assets, properties or operations
are subject, except to the extent that such breach would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Seller.

 



 

 **5.6** **No Litigation**. There is no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of
such Seller, threatened, nor any Order is outstanding, against or involving
any Seller or any of its officers, directors, managers, shareholders,
properties, assets or businesses, whether at law or in equity, before or by
any Governmental Authority, which would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the ability of such Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and discharge its obligations under, this Agreement.

 



 

 **5.7** **Investment Representations**. Each Seller: (a) is an "accredited
investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the
Securities Act; (b) is acquiring its portion of the Exchange Shares for itself
for investment purposes only, and not with a view towards any resale or
distribution of such Exchange Shares; (c) has been advised and understands
that the Exchange Shares (i) are being issued in reliance upon one or more
exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities Laws and (ii) have not been and shall not be
registered under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities Laws
and, therefore, must be held indefinitely and cannot be resold unless such
Exchange Shares are registered under the Securities Act and all applicable
state securities Laws, unless exemptions from registration are available; (d)
is aware that an investment in the Purchaser is a speculative investment and
is subject to the risk of complete loss; and (e) acknowledges that the
Purchaser is under no obligation hereunder to register the Exchange Shares
under the Securities Act. No Seller has any Contract with any Person to sell,
transfer, or grant participations to such Person, or to any third Person, with
respect to the Exchange Shares. By reason of such Seller's business or
financial experience, or by reason of the business or financial experience of
such Seller's "purchaser representatives" (as that term is defined in Rule
501(h) under the Securities Act), each Seller is capable of evaluating the
risks and merits of an investment in the Purchaser and of protecting its
interests in connection with this investment. Each Seller has carefully read
and understands all materials provided by or on behalf of the Purchaser or its
Representatives to such Seller or such Seller's Representatives pertaining to
an investment in the Purchaser and has consulted, as such Seller has deemed
advisable, with its own attorneys, accountants or investment advisors with
respect to the investment contemplated hereby and its suitability for such
Seller. Each Seller acknowledges that the Exchange Shares are subject to
dilution for events not under the control of such Seller. Each Seller has
completed its independent inquiry and has relied fully upon the advice of its
own legal counsel, accountant, financial and other Representatives in
determining the legal, tax, financial and other consequences of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and the suitability of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby for such Seller and its particular
circumstances, and, except as set forth herein, has not relied upon any
representations or advice by the Purchaser or its Representatives. Each Seller
acknowledges and agrees that such Seller has not been guaranteed or
represented to by any Person, (i) any specific amount or the event of the
distribution of any cash, property or other interest in the Purchaser or (ii)
the profitability or value of the Exchange Shares in any manner whatsoever.
Each Seller: (A) has been represented by independent counsel (or has had the
opportunity to consult with independent counsel and has declined to do so);
(B) has had the full right and opportunity to consult with such Seller's
attorneys and other advisors and has availed itself of this right and
opportunity; (C) has carefully read and fully understands this Agreement in
its entirety and has had it fully explained to it or him by such counsel; (D)
is fully aware of the contents hereof and the meaning, intent and legal effect
thereof; and (E) is competent to execute this Agreement and has executed this
Agreement free from coercion, duress or undue influence.

 **5.8** **Lock-Up Provisions**.

 



 

(a) Each Seller hereby agrees not to, during the period commencing from the
Closing Date and ending on the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
** _Lock-Up Period_** "): (i) lend, offer, pledge, hypothecate, encumber,
donate, assign, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to
purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or
warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or
indirectly, any Exchange Shares, (ii) enter into any swap or other arrangement
that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic
consequences of ownership of the Exchange Shares or (iii) publicly disclose
the intention to do any of the foregoing, whether any such transaction
described in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) above is to be settled by delivery of
the Exchange Shares or other securities, in cash or otherwise (any of the
foregoing described in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii), a " ** _Prohibited
Transfer_** "). The foregoing sentence shall not apply to the transfer of any
or all of the Exchange Shares owned by a Seller, either during his or her
lifetime or on death, (A) by gift, will or intestate succession, or (B) to any
Affiliate, shareholder, member, partner or trust beneficiary, as the case may
be, of such Seller; provided, however, that in any of cases (A) or (B) it
shall be a condition to such transfer that the transferee executes and
delivers to the Purchaser an agreement stating that the transferee is
receiving and holding the Exchange Shares subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, and there shall be no further transfer of such Exchange Shares
except in accordance with this _Section 5.8(a)_. Each Seller further agrees to
execute such agreements as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser that are
consistent the foregoing or that are necessary to give further effect thereto.

 



 

(b) If any Prohibited Transfer is made or attempted contrary to the provisions
of _Section 5.8(a)_ , such purported Prohibited Transfer shall be null and
void ab initio, and the Purchaser shall refuse to recognize any such purported
transferee of the Exchange Shares as one of its equity holders for any
purpose. In order to enforce this _Section 5.8(b)_ , Purchaser may impose
stop-transfer instructions with respect to the Exchange Shares of each Seller
(and permitted transferees and assigns thereof) until the end of the Lock-Up
Period.

TRANSFER SET FORTH IN A SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT DATED AS OF [EFFECTIVE DATE]
BY AND AMONG THE ISSUER OF SUCH SECURITIES (THE "COMPANY") AND CERTAIN OF THE
COMPANY'S STOCKHOLDERS, AS AMENDED. A COPY OF SUCH SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT
WILL BE FURNISHED WITHOUT CHARGE BY THE COMPANY TO THE HOLDER HEREOF UPON
WRITTEN REQUEST."

 



 

 **5.9** **Finders and Investment Bankers**. No Seller, nor any of their
respective Representatives on their behalf, has employed any broker, finder or
investment banker or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees,
commissions, finders' fees or similar fees in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **5.10** **Independent Investigation**. Each Seller has conducted its own
independent investigation, review and analysis of the business, results of
operations, prospects, condition (financial or otherwise) or assets of the
Purchaser, and acknowledges that it has been provided adequate access to the
personnel, properties, assets, premises, books and records, and other
documents and data of the Purchaser for such purpose. Each Seller acknowledges
and agrees that: (a) in making its decision to enter into this Agreement and
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, it has relied solely upon
its own investigation and the express representations and warranties of the
Purchaser set forth in _Article III_ (including the related portions of the
Purchaser Disclosure Schedules and any Supplemental Disclosure Schedules
provided by the Purchaser); and (b) neither the Purchaser nor any of its
Representatives have made any representation or warranty as to the Purchaser
or this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in _Article III_ (including

essence. Each party shall submit a proposal for resolution of the Dispute to
the arbitrator within twenty days after confirmation of the appointment of the
arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the power to order any party to do, or
to refrain from doing, anything consistent with this Agreement and applicable
Law, including to perform its contractual obligation(s); provided, that the
arbitrator shall be limited to ordering pursuant to the foregoing power (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall order) the relevant party (or parties, as
applicable) to comply with only one or the other of the proposals. The
arbitrator's award shall be in writing and shall include a reasonable
explanation of the arbitrator's reason(s) for selecting one or the other
proposal. The seat of arbitration shall be in the [State of Nevada]. The

Party hereto hereby (a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Specified
Court for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any Party hereto and (b) irrevocably waives, and agrees

claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution,
that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby may not be enforced in or by any Specified Court. Each Party agrees
that a final judgment in any Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law. Each Party irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and
complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on behalf of itself, or its
property, by personal delivery of copies of such process to such Party at the
applicable address set forth in _Section 11.1_. Nothing in this _Section 11.5_

an applicable Party in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
restraining order to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without the requirement to post
any bond or other security or to prove that money damages would be inadequate,
this being in addition to any other right or remedy to which such Party may be
entitled under this Agreement, at law or in equity.

 



 

 **11.8** **Severability**. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a jurisdiction, such provision shall

necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will substitute
for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable and equitable
provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and enforceable, the
intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

delay by a Party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right hereunder.
