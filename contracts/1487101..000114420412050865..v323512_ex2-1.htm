Section 2.01 _Closing_.

  



  

(a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, on the Closing Date, Sellers will sell the Shares to
Purchaser, and Purchaser will purchase the Shares from Sellers. The closing
of the sale and purchase of the Shares (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at the offices of Astrachan Gunst Thomas Rubin, P.C., 217 E. Redwood Street,
Suite 2100, Baltimore, Maryland 21202, commencing at 10:00 a.m. local time on
a date within three Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions to the obligations of the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than those conditions which by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing), or such other date as the Parties may mutually
determine, _provided, however_ , that the Closing must occur by the Outside
Date. The day on which the Closing actually occurs is herein sometimes
referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ". The Closing shall be effective as of
11:59 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on the Closing Date. By agreement of the
Parties, the Closing may take place by conference call, telecopy or e-mail
with exchange of original signatures by overnight mail.

  



  

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the " _Outside Date_ " to
consummate and close the transactions described herein shall be the later of
(A) October 19, 2012 or (B) extended to not later than November 30, 2012
provided that Purchaser (x) delivers written notice to Company on or before
October 19, 2012 informing Company of its election to extend the outside date
to November 30, 2012 and (y) deposits into the an escrow account (the "
_Deposit Escrow Account_ "), on or before October 19, 2012, Four Million
Dollars ($4,000,000) (the " _Deposit_ "), representing the amount of the
Purchaser Termination Fee, to be held pursuant to the Deposit Escrow
Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit A-1_ (the " _Deposit Escrow Agreement_
") and released as provided in the Deposit Escrow Agreement and this _Section
2.01(b)_.

  



  

(i) If, in connection with an extension of the Outside Date to
November 30, 2012 by the Purchaser, the Purchaser has paid the Deposit
into the Deposit Escrow Account, such Deposit shall be released to Purchaser
on the Closing Date for Purchaser to apply toward the Aggregate Consideration
to be paid by the Purchaser on any Closing Date that occurs on or prior to the
Outside Date.

(ii) In the event the Company, Sellers and Sellers' Representative
are not in material breach of their obligations under this Agreement and the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.01(c)_ due to a
failure of the Purchaser and Parent to fulfill the conditions set forth in
_Section 10.02(a)_ or _10.03(a)_ or due to a material default by Purchaser or
Parent hereunder, if the Purchaser has paid the Deposit into the Deposit
Escrow Account, the Company may submit a " _Claim Notice_ " to the Escrow
Agent and the Purchaser requesting that the Deposit be released from the
Deposit Escrow Account and paid to the Company in satisfaction of the
Purchaser Termination Fee. A " _Claim Notice_ " shall be deemed to have been
given if Company delivers to the Escrow Agent and the Purchaser a written
notice containing a description of the circumstances supporting the
Company's belief that the Purchaser and Parent have failed to fulfill the
conditions set forth in _Section 10.02(a)_ or _10.03(a)_  of this Agreement
or have committed a material default under this Agreement. Within ten (10)
Business Days following its receipt of any Claim Notice (the " _Response
Period_ "), the Purchaser may notify the Company and the Escrow Agent in
writing as to whether it agrees (an " _Agreement Notice_ ") or disagrees (an
" _Objection Notice_ ") with the Claim Notice. If Purchaser delivers an
Agreement Notice, or does not give an Objection Notice within the Response
Period, then Company shall, immediately upon its receipt of the Agreement
Notice or upon the expiration of the Response Period, as applicable, be
entitled to have the Deposit released from the Deposit Escrow Account and paid
to the Company in full satisfaction of the Purchaser Termination Fee. If an
Objection Notice is given within the Response Period, the Deposit shall not be
released from escrow until the Escrow Agent: (A) receives joint written
instructions from the Company and the Purchaser, in which case the Escrow
Agent shall disburse the Deposit (or any portion thereof) as directed in the
joint instruction letter; or (B) receives a final nonappealable award or
order of a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to the Company's
entitlement to the Purchaser Termination Fee, in which case the Deposit shall
be disbursed to the Company or the Purchaser in accordance with such award or
order; or (C) receives a final appealable award or order of a court of
competent jurisdiction with respect to the Company's entitlement to the
Purchaser Termination Fee and written statements signed by the owing Party and
the receiving Party that each has elected not to appeal such award or order,
in which case the Deposit shall be disbursed to the Company or the Purchaser
in accordance with such award or order.

  



  

(iii) If the Purchaser has paid the Deposit into the Deposit Escrow
Account and this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 11.01(a), (b),
(d), (e), (f), (g) or (h)_ herein, the Deposit shall be released from the
Deposit Escrow Account and paid to the Purchaser upon the Purchaser's
submission of a written request to the Escrow Agent for release of the Deposit
together with a copy of the written notice of termination pursuant to any of
the Sections listed above in this _Section 2.01(b)(iii)_.

(iv) If the Purchaser has paid the Deposit into the Deposit Escrow
Account and on or before the Outside Date this Agreement has not
been terminated in accordance with _Section 11.01_ herein and the
transactions described herein have not been consummated and closed, the
Deposit shall be released from the Deposit Escrow Account and paid to the
Purchaser upon the Purchaser's submission of a written request to the Escrow
Agent for release of the Deposit.

Section 2.03 _Aggregate Consideration_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
reliance upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of
the Sellers and Company set forth herein, and as consideration for the
purchase and sale of the Shares, on and as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser
agrees to pay and transfer, and/or cause its Parent to pay and transfer on its
behalf hereunder, to the Sellers in the proportions set forth on _Schedule
2.03(e)_ , the following consideration (collectively, the " _Aggregate
Consideration_ "):

  



  

(i) (A) A cash payment (the " _Closing Cash Payment_ "), payable in
the manner set forth in _Section 2.03(f)_ below, equal to One Hundred Million
Dollars ($100,000,000), _minus_ the amount, if any, by which Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital is less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (the "
_Target Net Working Capital "_), OR _plus_  fifty percent (50%) of the
amount, if any, by which the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital
exceeds the Target Net Working Capital, with the remaining fifty percent
(50%) of such amount (the " _Excess Estimated Working Capital Holdback_
") held by the Purchaser until determination of the Final Closing Date Net
Working Capital pursuant to _Section 2.03(c)_ , at which time it shall be
paid or retained as provided in _Section 2.03(d)_ ; and (B) Sixteen Million
Dollars ($16,000,000) to the Indemnity Escrow Account as set forth in
_Section 2.03(g)_ below;

  



  

(ii) That number of shares of Parent Common Stock determined by
dividing Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) by the average closing
market price of Parent's registered common stock as reported on the NASDAQ
Global Market over the last ten (10) trading days ending three (3) calendar
days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Closing Price_ "), to be issued to the
Sellers by Parent as indicated on _Schedule 2.03(a)(ii);_ and

  



   

13 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(iii) The amount, if any, determined pursuant to _Sections 2.03(d)_
and _(e)_ below within the time frame set forth therein.

  



  

(b) No later than one day prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Purchaser a good faith estimate of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital and attach the estimate to this Agreement as _Schedule
2.03(b)_ (" _Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "). The calculation
of Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital shall be in the form and use the
methodology set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto (" _Sample Working Capital
Calculation_ "). The Closing Cash Payment shall be adjusted based on the
Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital as set forth in _Section
2.03(a)(i)(A)_ above.

  



  

(c) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall have prepared and delivered to the Sellers' Representative
the calculation of Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Closing
Date Net Working Capital ")_. The calculation of Closing Date Net Working
Capital shall be in the form and use the methodology set forth on _Exhibit B_
hereto. The Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital
shall be final and binding on the Parties unless, within thirty (30) days
after delivery thereof to the Sellers' Representative, the Sellers'
Representative delivers to the Purchaser a written notice of dispute (a "
_Dispute Notice_ ") specifying in reasonable detail the items in dispute. Such
items in dispute shall be limited to arithmetic error or use of accounting
principles, policies, practices, classifications or methodologies other than
those set forth in _Exhibit B_. After delivery of a Dispute Notice, the
Sellers' Representative and the Purchaser shall promptly negotiate in good
faith with respect to the subject of the Dispute Notice, and if they are
unable to reach an agreement within fifteen (15) days after delivery by the
Sellers' Representative of the Dispute Notice, the dispute shall be
submitted to Grant Thornton LLP, or such other independent public accounting
firm as mutually agreed to by the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative
(the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall be directed to issue a final and binding decision
within thirty (30) days of submission of the Dispute Notice to the Independent
Accounting Firm, as to the issues of disagreement referred to in the Dispute
Notice and not resolved by the Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative,
_provided_ that, (i) in resolving any disputed item, the Independent
Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either Party; and (ii) in no event shall Closing
Date Net Working Capital as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm be
less than Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital nor
more than the Sellers' Representative calculation of Closing Date Net Working
Capital set forth in the Dispute Notice. The decision of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The
fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne one-half
by the Sellers and one-half by the Purchaser. The Closing Date Net Working
Capital finally determined under this _Section 2.03(c)_ shall be referred to
as the " _Final Closing Date Net Working Capital_ ".

(d) If the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital as determined
pursuant to _Section 2.03(c)_ above is greater than the Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital, the Purchaser shall pay such excess, together with
any Excess Estimated Working Capital Holdback amount, to the Sellers'
Representative for distribution to the Sellers as set forth in _Schedule
2.03(e)_. If the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital as determined
pursuant to _Section 2.03(c)_ above is less than the Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital, the Parties shall determine the dollar amount by
which the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital exceeds the Final
Closing Date Net Working Capital less the amount of the Excess Estimated
Working Capital Holdback, and (i) if such result is a negative number, the
Purchaser shall pay said amount (i.e. the amount of the negative number
without regard to the fact such number is negative) to the Sellers'
Representative for distribution to the Sellers as set forth in _Schedule
2.03(e)_  and the Purchaser shall retain any additional Excess Estimated
Working Capital Holdback amount, (ii) if the result is zero, then the
Purchaser shall retain the Excess Estimated Working Capital Holdback amount;
or (iii) if such result is a positive number, the Purchaser shall retain the
entire Excess Estimated Working Capital Holdback amount and the Sellers,
jointly and severally, shall pay the Purchaser in cash, within five (5)
Business Days after determination of the Final Closing Date Net Working
Capital, the full amount of the shortfall (i.e. the amount of the positive
number that results from the calculation). Each Seller shall be jointly and
severally liable for the amount of any such shortfall pursuant to this
_Section 2.03(d)_ and such liability shall be in addition to, independent of,
and not subject to any deductible, basket, cap or any limitations, thresholds
or exclusivity provisions set forth in _Article VII_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement.

  



  

(e) Each Seller shall receive each portion of the Aggregate
Consideration under this _Section 2.03_ , as set forth next to such
Seller's name on _Schedule 2.03(e)_.

  



  

(f)  On and as of the Closing Date, Purchaser will pay the Closing
Cash Payment by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the recipients as designated in a flow of funds memorandum (with wire
instructions for the below payments or instructions to pay certain amounts by
check) prepared by the Sellers and Company and reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser (the " _Flow of Funds Memorandum_ ") and containing the following:

  



  

(i) The amount of any Indebtedness (if any) that will be paid at
Closing;

  



  

(ii) The amount of expenses payable by the Sellers and the Company in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(e.g., payment to legal counsel, accountants and financial advisors) to the
extent remaining unpaid as of the Closing; and

  



  

(iii) The Closing Cash Payment (less the amounts set forth in clauses
(i) and (ii) above) to Sellers.

  



   

15 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(g)  On the Closing Date, Sixteen Million Dollars ($16,000,000) (the
" _Escrow Amount_ "), that would otherwise be delivered to the Sellers as
part of the Aggregate Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ , shall be
transferred to a separate escrow account (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_
"). The Escrow Amount shall be held in escrow until the end of the
eighteenth (18) month period following the Closing Date (or as otherwise set
forth in the Indemnity Escrow Agreement), as partial security for the
indemnification obligations of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement. The
Escrow Amount and the release thereof to the Purchaser and Sellers shall be
governed by the terms and conditions of an escrow agreement among the Sellers'
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), the Purchaser and Manufacturers
and Traders Trust Company (the " _Escrow Agent_ ") in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A-2 (the " _Indemnity Escrow Agreement_ ").

  



  

Section 2.04 _Transfer of Stock_.

  



  

(a) With respect to the shares of the Parent Common Stock to be
issued to the Sellers as described in _Section 2.03(a)_ , the Purchaser is
transferring and conveying such shares to the Sellers along with certificates
representing such shares, bearing such restrictive legends as may be required
by Parent's legal counsel and transfer agent, consistent with the terms of
this Agreement, including  _Sections 4.06_ and _6.06_.

  



  

(b) The Sellers are transferring and conveying the Shares to the
Purchaser along with certificates representing the Shares, duly endorsed in
blank or with stock powers duly endorsed in blank, in proper form for
transfer.

  



  

Section 2.05 _Sellers ' Representative_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Sellers, by execution of this Agreement, hereby
irrevocably constitutes and appoints Michael Poole as the sole,
exclusive, true and lawful agent, representative and attorney-in-fact for
such Sellers (" _Sellers ' Representative_") for any and all matters relating
to, arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement and the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement, including for purposes of taking any action or omitting to
take action on behalf of Sellers under this Agreement and the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement. The Sellers' Representative hereby accepts such
appointment. All actions, notices, communications and determinations by or on
behalf of Sellers shall be given or made by Sellers' Representative and all
such actions, notices, communications and determinations by the Sellers'
Representative shall conclusively be deemed to have been authorized by, and
shall be binding upon, any of and all Sellers. By giving notice to the
Sellers' Representative in the manner provided by _Section 9.01_ , Purchaser
shall be deemed to have given notice to all Sellers. Any action taken by the
Sellers' Representative may be considered by Purchaser to be the action of
Sellers for whom such action was taken for all purposes of this Agreement and
the Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(b) If Sellers' Representative dies or becomes legally
incapacitated, then those Sellers holding a majority of the Shares as of the
Closing Date promptly shall designate in writing to Purchaser a single
individual to replace the deceased or legally incapacitated Sellers'
Representative as the successor Sellers' Representative hereunder. If at any
time there shall not be a Sellers' Representative or Sellers so fail to
designate a successor Sellers' Representative, then Purchaser may have a court
of competent jurisdiction appoint a Sellers' Representative hereunder. Any
such successor Sellers' Representative shall succeed to all of the rights and
obligations of the Sellers' Representative hereunder.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing Sellers'
Representative is designated as the sole and exclusive agent,
representative and attorney-in-fact for each Seller for all purposes related
to this Agreement, including (i) service of process upon Sellers, (ii)
executing and delivering to Purchaser or any other Person on behalf of any of

agreements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement, (iii) receipt of all notices on behalf of Sellers
with respect to any matter, suit, claim, action or proceeding arising with
respect to the sale of the Shares or any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement including the defense, settlement or compromise of any claim,
action or proceeding pursuant to _Section 2.03(c), 6.04(f)_ or _Article VII_
of this Agreement, (iv) to disburse any funds received hereunder to such
Seller and each other Seller, (v) to execute and deliver on behalf of such
Seller any amendment or waiver hereto, (vi) to take all other actions to be
taken by or on behalf of such Seller in connection herewith,
including, without limitation, the execution, delivery and performance of the
Indemnity Escrow Agreement, (vii) to do each and every act and exercise any
and all rights which such Seller or the Sellers, as applicable, collectively
are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement, and (viii)
to resolve claims under the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, including, but not
limited to, all matters concerning any Dispute Notice under _Section 2.03(c)_
, and claims for indemnification under _Section 6.04(f)_ and _Article VII_ of
this Agreement. All decisions and actions by the Sellers' Representative (to
the extent authorized by this Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the
Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest same. Sellers may act only through Sellers' Representative
and Purchaser shall be entitled to rely on Sellers'
Representative's authority as the agent, representative and attorney-in-fact
of Sellers for all purposes hereunder and under the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement and shall have no liability for any such reliance. None of
Sellers may revoke the authority of Sellers' Representative. Each Seller
hereby ratifies and confirms, and hereby agrees to ratify and confirm, any

consultants and contractors of the Company to execute
appropriate confidentiality agreements and all such employees, consultants
and contractors have executed such agreements. The Company's current and

payroll and unemployment Tax Returns, all property and sales and use Tax
Returns, Tax examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed

Service or any other Tax authority for all years since its inception. No
claims have ever been made by a Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where
the Company does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction. To the Knowledge of the Company, the
Company has not commenced activities in any jurisdiction which will result in
an initial filing of any Tax Return with respect to Taxes imposed by a
Governmental Authority that it had not previously been required to file in the
tax period immediately preceding the Closing Date. The Company has not
requested or obtained any extension of time within which to file any Tax
Return, which Tax Return has not since been filed.

  



  

(c) There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company,
anticipated, audits, examinations, investigations or other proceedings in
respect of any Tax of the Company. No deficiency for any amount of Tax has
been asserted or assessed by any Taxing authority in writing against the
Company, which deficiency has not been satisfied by payment, settled or been
withdrawn.

  



  

(d) The unpaid Taxes of the Company did not, as of the Balance Sheet
Date, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the Balance Sheet (rather than in any notes
thereto) and will not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time
through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of
the Company. The Company has not incurred any liability for Taxes since the
Balance Sheet other than in the ordinary course of business.

filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return, (ii) has no liability for

within the meaning of, and has complied with the reporting requirements of,

(i) The Company has not received a written ruling from or entered
into a written agreement with a Governmental Authority relating to any Taxes
where such ruling or agreement could have a continuing effect with respect to
any taxable period for which the Company has not filed a Tax Return. No issue
has been raised by any Governmental Authority with respect to Taxes of the
Company in any prior examination which, by application of the same or similar
principles, could reasonably be expected to result in a proposed
deficiency for any other taxable period. The Company has not taken any action
not in accordance with past practice that would have the effect of deferring
a measure of Taxes from a period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to
the Closing Date to a period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.17(i)_ attached hereto, the Company
has no deferred income or Tax liabilities arising out of any transaction,
including but not limited to, any (i) intercompany transaction (as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13); or (ii) the disposal of any property
in a transaction accounted for under the installment method pursuant to
Section 453 of the Code, except to the extent adequately reserved for on the

(ii) acquired the stock of any corporation that is a qualified subchapter S
subsidiary.

  



  

(k) The Company uses the accrual method of accounting for Tax
purposes. The Company's Tax basis in its assets for purposes of
determining their future amortization, depreciation and other income tax
deductions is accurately reflected on the Company's Tax books and records.

or exclude any deduction or loss from taxable income for any taxable period
or portion thereof on or after the Closing as a result of any (i) change in
method of accounting made prior to or in connection with the Closing, (ii)
closing agreement under Section 7121 of the Internal Revenue Code executed
prior to the Closing (or in the case of each of (i) or (ii), under any
similar provision of applicable Law), (iii) installment sale or open
transaction disposition consummated prior to the Closing, or (iv) prepaid
amount received prior to the Closing.

  



  

(m) Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.17(m)_ , the Company does not
have or maintain any nonqualified deferred compensation plans subject to
Section 409A of the Code. With respect to any nonqualified deferred
compensation plan identified in _Schedule 3.17(m)_ : (i) such plan has not
been materially modified (as defined in Section 409A of the Code) since
October 3, 2004, (ii) such plan has been operated and administered (A) in
good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code between January 1, 2005

(b) Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall timely prepare and
file all Tax Returns for the Company that were not due to be filed
(including extended due dates) prior to the Closing Date for all periods
commencing prior to and ending on or before the Closing Date (the " _Pre-
Closing Tax Period_ "). The Sellers (through the Sellers' Representative)

(c) Following the Closing, the Sellers (through the Sellers'
Representative) and the Purchaser shall, unless prohibited by applicable
Law, close the taxable period of the Company as of the close of business on
the Closing Date. If applicable Law does not permit the Company to close its
taxable year on the Closing Date or in the case of Taxes payable with respect
to any Straddle Period, the amount of such Taxes allocable to the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any
Taxes based upon or related to income or gross receipts, be deemed equal to
the amount which would be payable if the books of the Company were closed and
the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of
any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or gross receipts,
be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes actually incurred prior to the
Closing Date, and if not so determinable, shall be the amount of such Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire Straddle Period. Any allocation of income or deductions required to
determine any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account
as though the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date based on an
interim closing of the books and records of the Company as of the close of
business on the Closing Date; _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited
to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the
period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days in each such period.

  



  

(d) Following the Closing, the Sellers (through the Sellers'
Representative) and the Purchaser shall provide to each other prompt
notice of, and as requested by the other party reasonable cooperation
(including, without limitation, make available at a mutually convenient time

any audit or similar investigation or proceeding in which the IRS or any
other Governmental Authority makes or proposes to make a Tax adjustment to any
Tax period of the Company.

Representative) shall have the right, at their own expense, to control
any audit or examination by any Taxing authority, initiate any claim for
refund, contest, resolve and defend against any assessment, notice of
deficiency, or other adjustment (a " _Tax Matter_ ") as it relates to the
Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods or the portion of any Straddle Period
through the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers
and Sellers' Representative shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such
Tax Matter without the consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, if such settlement, compromise or
abandonment would not adversely affect the Purchaser. Following the Closing,
the Purchaser shall have the right, at its own expense, to control any Tax
Matter as it relates to the Company for the portion of any Straddle Periods
after the Closing Date and all Post-Closing Tax Periods; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that with respect to Straddle Periods, the Purchaser shall not
settle, compromise or abandon any Tax Matter without the consent of the
Sellers' Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or

arising from, (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) attributable to

provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Laws) the Company for Pre-Closing
Periods and any portion of a Straddle Period through the Closing Date
(including Taxes payable by the Sellers pursuant to _Section 6.04(b)_ ), and

Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, any indemnification,
reimbursement or other payment to be made by a Seller pursuant to this
_Section 7.02_  shall be paid first from the Indemnity Escrow Account, and

or agreement of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any other

Section 7.05 _Third Party Claims_.

  



  

The obligations and liabilities of the parties hereunder with respect to

as the case may be (in either case an " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
written notice thereof in reasonable detail in light of the circumstances
then known to such Indemnified Party along with a copy of the Claim. The
failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnified Party from any
obligation under _Article VII_ except where, and solely to the extent that,
such failure actually and materially prejudices the rights of the Indemnifying
Party.

  



  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to undertake at its
sole expense, by counsel of its own choosing, the defense of such Claim.

  



  

(c) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall elect not to
undertake such defense, or within a reasonable time after notice of any such
Claim from the other party shall fail to defend, the Indemnified Party (upon
notice to the Indemnifying Party) shall have the right to undertake the
defense by counsel or other representatives of its own choosing, on behalf of
and for the account and risk of the Indemnifying Party (who shall be
responsible for paying the cost of such counsel and defense).

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Article VII_ to the contrary,
(i) neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall,
without the other's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), settle or compromise any Claim or consent to entry of any judgment
which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release from all
liability in respect of such Claim, (ii) in the event that the Indemnifying
Party undertakes defense of any Claim in accordance with _Section 7.05(b)_,
the Indemnified Party, by counsel or other representative of its own choosing
and at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to consult with, and be
provided reasonable access to all relevant information within the possession
of, the Indemnifying Party and its counsel or other representatives concerning
such Claim and (iii) in the event that the Indemnified Party undertakes
defense of any Claim in accordance with _Section 7.05(c)_, the Indemnifying
Party, by counsel or other representative of its own choosing and at its sole
cost and expense, shall have the right to consult with, and be provided
reasonable access to all relevant information within the possession of, the
Indemnified Party and its counsel or other representatives concerning such

(b) Except as provided hereafter, the Sellers maximum aggregate
indemnification liability for indemnified Losses under _Section 7.02_  herein
shall not exceed Sixteen Million Dollars ($16,000,000) (the " _Cap "_),

relating to (i) breaches of the Fundamental Representations or the
representations in _Section 3.16_ , (ii) obligations of the Sellers to the
extent a breach results from fraud or intentional representation by any
Seller, (iii) any failure to perform, nonfulfillment, nonobservance or breach
or violation of, or default in the performance of, any covenant or agreement

pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be net of (i) any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party under its insurance policies or otherwise
for such Loss; (ii) any related reserve in respect thereof resulting in a
purchase price adjustment pursuant to _Sections 2.03(c)_ and _(d)_ ; and

against the Company as a result of any indemnification or other payments made
by any of the Sellers to any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to
this Agreement.

contrary, no party shall be limited, at any time, from recovering any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by it relating to or arising out of or in
connection with fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

  



  

(f) Neither the Basket Amount nor the Cap shall apply to Sellers'
indemnity obligations under _Section 6.04(f)_ herein.

available, at the other's expense, all information (but excluding
privileged communications) necessary for the other to pursue any
indemnification or reimbursement from a third party for any Losses in
the event that the other elects to pursue such indemnification or
reimbursement. The Sellers' Representative shall fully cooperate with
Purchaser in seeking and obtaining payment from the Sellers of all amounts due
to Purchaser under this Agreement, including Sections _2.03(d), 6.04(b),

Section 8.04 _Notification by Company_.

  



    

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company, the
Sellers and the Sellers' Representative shall provide prompt notice to the
Purchaser in writing of any material variances from the representations and
warranties contained in ___Articles III and IV_ , and of any other fact or
event that constitutes a breach of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements in this Agreement made by the Company, the Sellers or the
Sellers' Representative and of any event or occurrence which is likely to
cause any such representation or warranty to be untrue or inaccurate on the
Closing Date or is likely to result in the Company's, the Sellers or the
Sellers' Representative's failure to satisfy any covenant, agreement or
condition to be complied with by it hereunder; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 8.04_ shall not (i) limit or
otherwise affect any remedies available to Purchaser or (ii) constitute an
acknowledgment or admission of a breach of this Agreement; provided further
that a party's unintentional failure to give notice under this _Section 8.04_
shall not be deemed a covenant breach, but if such breach remains uncured as
of the Closing, shall constitute only a breach of the
underlying representation, warranty, covenant, condition or agreement, as the
case may be. Except as expressly set forth in _Section 8.04(c)_  herein, no
disclosure or notice by the Company, a Seller or the Sellers' Representative
pursuant to this _Section 8.04(a)_  shall be deemed to amend or supplement
the appropriate Disclosure Schedule delivered on the date hereof or prevent or
cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant,
condition or agreement.

  



  

(b) With respect to any disclosure or notice by the Company, any
Seller or Sellers' Representative under this _Section 8.04_  that constitutes
a breach giving rise to a right of termination under _Article XI_ herein, the
Purchaser shall have the right to (i) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Article XI_ or (ii) consummate and close the transactions described herein
without waiving the breach, violation or condition, in which case Purchaser
shall have any and all rights with respect to indemnification under _Article
VII_ for all Losses suffered or incurred by Purchaser arising out of said
breach; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent the Company, any
Seller or the Sellers' Representative from curing or attempting to cure such
breach or failure to satisfy such condition.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 8.04_ to the
contrary, written notifications may be delivered by the Company to the
Purchaser at any time prior to the date that is two Business Days prior to
the Closing Date to supplement, as expressly permitted hereafter, solely the
following sections of the Disclosure Schedules, in each case as is necessary
to reflect any action of the Company occurring after the date of this
Agreement that is required to be taken under this Agreement or permitted to be
taken under this _Article VIII_ , which would not result in a breach of any
representation or warranty that corresponds to the section of the
Disclosure Schedule so modified by such notification (and all cross
references in the Disclosure Schedule will be disregarded for such purpose): 
_Schedules 3.03_ ( _No Conflict or Violation_ ) and _3.04_ ( _No Consent or
Filing_ ) may each be supplemented solely to note any notification or consent
required under any new Government Contracts acquired by the Company after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing Date; _Schedule 3.06_ ( _Financial
Information_ ) may be supplemented solely to include any updated Financial
Statements of the Company as provided in _Section 3.06_ herein; _Schedule
3.08_ ( _Material Contracts_ ) may be supplemented solely to add to the list
and description of Material Contracts acquired by the Company after the date
hereof and prior to the Closing Date and not to add any Loss Contracts;
_Schedule 3.16(a)_ ( _Intellectual Property_ ) may be supplemented solely to
add to the list of Intellectual Property; _Schedule 3.20(m)_ ( _Preferential
Treatment in Award of Government Contracts_ ) may be supplemented solely to
add any new, applicable contracts acquired by the Company after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing Date; _Schedule 3.20(n)_ ( _Outstanding
Bids or Proposals_ ) may be supplemented solely to add new bids or proposals
submitted by the Company after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date;
_Schedule 3.21_  ( _Banking Relationships_ ) may be supplemented solely to
update the information set forth in such schedule; _Schedule 3.24(a)_  (
_Accounts Receivable_ ) may be supplemented solely to provide the updated list
of Accounts Receivable required by _Section 3.24(a)_ herein; _Schedule 3.28_
( _Order Backlog_ ) may be supplemented solely to add new purchase orders and
contracts acquired by the Company after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing Date and _Schedule 3.29_ ( _Government Furnished Equipment_ ) may be
supplemented solely to update the information set forth in such schedule. Any
such notification will have the effect of qualifying, as of the Closing Date,
only the representation or warranty that corresponds to the section of the
Disclosure Schedule so modified by such notification (and all cross
references in the Disclosure Schedule will be disregarded for such purpose)
and curing any potential inaccuracy of such representation or warranty as
measured as of the Closing Date that otherwise might have existed by reason
of such action. Under no circumstances will any such notification qualify any
representation or warranty as of the date of this Agreement or cure any
breach of or otherwise release liability for any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty that existed as of the date of this Agreement.

Section 8.05 _No Solicitation_. __

  



  

(a) Until the earlier of (i) the Closing, or (ii) the date of

employees, agents, affiliates, and advisors (each a " _Company Representative_
") not to (and shall not authorize or knowingly permit them to), directly or
indirectly, take any of the following actions with any party other than
Purchaser and its designees: (A) solicit, initiate, participate or knowingly
encourage any negotiations or discussions with respect to any offer or
proposal to acquire all or any portion of the Company's business or
properties, or any equity interest in the Company or shares of Company
capital stock or any rights to acquire any shares of Company capital stock or
other equity interests in the Company, regardless of the form of transaction
(a " _Competing Transaction_ "), or effect any such Competing
Transaction, (B) disclose any information to any Person concerning the
business or properties of the Company, or afford to any Person access to the
Company's properties, books or records other than in the ordinary course of
business or in connection with the negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement, (C) assist or cooperate with any Person to make any proposal
regarding a Competing Transaction, or (D) enter into any agreement with any
Person providing for a Competing Transaction. In the event that the
Company or any Company Representative shall receive, prior to the Closing or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article XI_ hereof, any
offer, proposal, or request, directly or indirectly, of the type referenced in
clause (A), (C) or (D) above, or any request for disclosure or access as
referenced in clause (B) above, the Company and the Sellers shall, or shall
cause such Company Representative to, immediately (x) terminate, suspend or
otherwise discontinue any and all discussions or other negotiations with such
Person with regard to such offers, proposals, or requests and (y) notify
Purchaser thereof, including the terms and conditions of such proposal or
inquiry, in reasonable detail.

(b) The Parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in
the event that the provisions of _Section 8.05(a)_ were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed by the Parties thereto that Purchaser shall be entitled to
an immediate injunction or injunctions, without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting
any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of the provisions of _Section
8.05(a)_  and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which Purchaser may be entitled at Law or in
equity. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in _Section 8.05(a)_ by (i) the Sellers'
Representative, any Seller, or any agent, representative or affiliate of such
Seller or (ii) any officer, director, agent, representative or affiliate of
the Company, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

  



  

Article IX. PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS OF PURCHASER

  



  

Section 9.01 _Notification by Purchaser_.

  



  

From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide
prompt notice to the Company in writing of any material variances from
the representations and warranties contained in _Article V_ , and of any
other fact or event that constitutes a breach of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement made by the Purchaser
or Parent and of any event or occurrence which is likely to cause any such
representation or warranty to be untrue or inaccurate on the Closing Date or
is likely to result in the Purchaser's or the Parent's failure to satisfy any
covenant, agreement or condition to be complied with by them hereunder;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section
9.01_ shall not (a) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to
Company or (b) constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a breach of this
Agreement; provided further that a party's unintentional failure to give
notice under this _Section 9.01_ shall not be deemed a covenant breach, but
if such breach remains uncured as of the Closing, shall constitute only a
breach of the underlying representation, warranty, covenant, condition or
agreement, as the case may be. No disclosure or notice by the Purchaser
pursuant to this _Section 9.01_ shall be deemed to amend or supplement the
appropriate Disclosure Schedule delivered on the date hereof or prevent
or cure any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant,
condition or agreement. With respect to any disclosure or notice by the
Purchaser under this _Section 9.01_ that constitutes a breach giving rise to a
right of termination under _Article XI_ herein, the Company shall have the
right to (a) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article XI_ or (b)
consummate and close the transactions described herein without waiving the
breach, violation or condition, in which case the Sellers shall have any and
all rights with respect to indemnification under _Article VII_ for all Losses
suffered or incurred by them arising out of said breach; provided, however,
that nothing herein shall prevent the Purchaser from curing or attempting to
cure such breach or failure to satisfy such condition.

Section 12.08 _Interpretation_.

  



  

When a reference is made in this Agreement to a Section, subsection, Exhibit
or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section, subsection, Exhibit or
Schedule of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained
in this Agreement, in any Schedules and in the table of contents to this
Agreement, are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. All Exhibits and Schedules
annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made part
of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Any capitalized term used
in any Exhibit or Schedule and not otherwise defined shall have the
meaning given to such term in this Agreement. Unless the context clearly
requires otherwise, whenever the words "include", "includes", "including",
"such as" or terms of similar meaning are used in this agreement, they shall
be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words
"hereof", "herein", "hereby" and "hereunder" and terms of similar meaning
when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not
to any particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive.
The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a
subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if".
The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as to the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement or instrument
defined or referred to herein means such agreement or instrument as from
time to time amended, modified or supplemented as permitted herein or
therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. Pronouns of one gender shall include all genders. All accounting
conventions shall be consistent with GAAP unless otherwise specified. The
headings in this Agreement are for reference only, and shall not affect the
interpretation of this Agreement. All references to "Dollars" or "$" shall be
to U.S. Dollars unless otherwise specified. All references to "days" shall
mean calendar days unless Business Days are specified.

  



  

Section 12.09 _Signature in Counterparts_.

  



  

This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts (whether transmitted
by facsimile or other electronic means) none of which need contain the
signatures of all parties, each of which shall be deemed to be an original,
and all of which taken together constitute one and the same instrument. It
shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce or account
for more than the number of counterparts containing the respective signatures
of, or on behalf of, all of the parties hereto.

  



  

Section 12.10 _Remedies Cumulative_.

  



  

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all rights and remedies of the
Parties under this Agreement are cumulative and without prejudice to any
other rights or remedies under Law.

  



  

Section 12.11 _Entire Agreement_.

  



  

This Agreement (including the Recitals which are incorporated in and made a
part of this Agreement), together with all Exhibits and Schedules hereto
and the Transaction Documents, constitutes the entire agreement among the
Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the Parties. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Parent has
joined in this Agreement for the limited purpose of making the representations
and warranties set forth in _Article V_ herein, and for no other purpose.

  



  

Section 12.12 _Attorneys ' Fees_.

  



  

If any Party hereto initiates any legal action arising out or in connection
with this Agreement, the prevailing Party in such action, as determined by the
court, shall be entitled to recover from the other Party all reasonable
attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing
Party in connection therewith.

Section 12.13 _Electronic Delivery_.

  



  

This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in
connection with this Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the
extent delivered by means of a facsimile machine or electronic mail (any such
delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any
such agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto shall re
execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No
party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of
Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of
Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each
such party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such
defense related to lack of authenticity.
