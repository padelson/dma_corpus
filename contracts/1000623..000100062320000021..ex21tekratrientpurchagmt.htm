EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT This EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is
made as of February 17, 2020, by and among EIS Buyer, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Seller"), Tekra, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Tekra"), Trient, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Trient" and,
together with Tekra, each a "Target Company" and collectively, the "Target
Companies"), DelStar Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"),
and, solely for the purposes set forth in Section 11.23, Schweitzer-Mauduit
International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Guarantor"). Capitalized
terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in
Article X below. WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, Seller owns all of the
outstanding equity interests of the Target Companies (the "Acquired Equity");
WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer desires to purchase from Seller, and Seller desires to sell
to Buyer, the Acquired Equity; WHEREAS, the respective boards of managers or
directors or other governing bodies, as applicable, of Seller, the Target
Companies, and Buyer have approved this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties, conditions and agreements contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE I
PURCHASE AND SALE OF EQUITY Section 1.01 Purchase and Sale of Equity. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Closing, Seller will sell, assign, transfer and convey to Buyer, and Buyer
will purchase and acquire from Seller, the Acquired Equity, in exchange for
the payment of the Estimated Purchase Price in cash to Seller. Payment for the
Acquired Equity will be made by wire transfer on the Closing Date of
immediately available funds to the Escrow and Paying Agent, and the Escrow and
Paying Agent will pay such cash to Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller to the Escrow
and Paying Agent. Section 1.02 Calculation of Closing and Final Consideration.
(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Purchase Price" means an amount equal
to: (i) $155,000,000.00, (ii) plus the total amount of Cash,
LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt007.jpg) 

(iii) minus the outstanding amount of Indebtedness as of the Closing, (iv)
minus the unpaid Seller Transaction Expenses, (v) plus the amount, if any, by
which the Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital Upper Limit;
(vi) minus the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital is less than
the Net Working Capital Lower Limit; (vii) minus the Adjustment Escrow Amount;
and (viii) minus the Indemnity Escrow Amount. (b) At least three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Target Companies will deliver to Buyer a
closing statement (the "Estimated Closing Statement"), setting forth the
Target Companies' good faith estimate of the Purchase Price (the "Estimated
Purchase Price"), and setting forth as separate line items all components
thereof, including (i) the Target Companies' supporting calculation of the Net
Working Capital determined in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles
and Schedule 10.01(e) and (ii) (A) a schedule setting forth the Seller
Transaction Expenses estimated by the Target Companies in good faith to remain
unpaid as of the Closing and (B) to the extent reasonably available, copies of
invoices for such Seller Transaction Expenses (other than with respect to any
change of control or similar bonus payments to be paid to employees via the
Target Companies' payroll), which include the wire transfer instructions, to
the extent such Seller Transaction Expense remains unpaid. The Target
Companies and Seller will consider in good faith any comments from Buyer with
respect to the Estimated Closing Statement and the calculation of the
Estimated Purchase Price; provided that the Target Companies and Seller will
not be required to incorporate any such comments into the Estimated Closing
Statement and the calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price. The Closing
Statement will be based solely on facts and circumstances as they exist as of
the Closing and will exclude the effect of any fact, event, change,
circumstance, act, development or decision occurring after the Closing. (c) As
promptly as possible, but in any event within 90 days after the Closing Date,
Buyer will deliver to Seller (i) an unaudited, consolidated balance sheet of
the Target Companies as of the Closing (which will have been prepared with the
assistance of Buyer's or the Target Companies' accountants) (the "Closing
Balance Sheet") and (ii) Buyer's calculation of the Purchase Price (together,
the "Closing Statement"). The Closing Statement will be prepared in a manner
consistent with the definitions of the terms Cash, Indebtedness, Seller
Transaction Expenses, Net Working Capital, the Agreed Accounting Principles
and Schedule 10.01(e). The Transaction Tax Benefits Amount set forth on
Schedule 10.01(e) will not be subject to post-Closing adjustment pursuant to
Sections 1.02(c) or (d). The Closing Statement will entirely disregard (A) any
and all effects on the assets or liabilities of the Target Companies as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby or of any financing or
refinancing arrangements entered into at any time by Buyer or any other
transaction entered into by Buyer in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) any of the plans, transactions, or
changes which Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or
made after the Closing 2 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt008.jpg) 

with respect to the Target Companies or their business or assets, or any facts
or circumstances that are unique or particular to Buyer or any of its assets
or liabilities. (d) Buyer will, and will cause the Target Companies to, (i)
assist Seller and its representatives in the review of the Closing Statement
and provide Seller and its representatives with reasonable access during
normal business hours to the books, records (including work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents), supporting data, facilities and employees of
the Target Companies for purposes of their review of the Closing Statement,
and (ii) reasonably cooperate with Seller and its representatives in
connection with such review, including providing on a timely basis all other
information necessary or useful in connection with the review of the Closing
Statement as is reasonably requested by Seller or its representatives. If
Seller has any objections to the Closing Statement, Seller will deliver to
Buyer a statement setting forth its objections thereto (an "Objections
Statement"), which statement will identify in reasonable detail those items
and amounts to which Seller objects (the "Disputed Items"). If an Objections
Statement is not delivered to Buyer within 60 days after delivery of the
Closing Statement, the Closing Statement as prepared by Buyer will be final,
binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto; provided that, in the event
Buyer or any Target Company does not provide any papers or documents
reasonably requested in writing by Seller or any of its representatives within
five days of request therefor (or such shorter period as may remain in such
60-day period), such 60-day period will be extended by one day for each
additional day required for Buyer or any Target Company to fully respond to
such request; provided further that such 60-day period will be extended a
minimum of 5 days following the date on which Buyer or one of the Target
Companies have fully responded to such request. Seller and Buyer will
negotiate in good faith to resolve the Disputed Items and all such discussions
related thereto will (unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller) be governed
by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state
rule, but if they do not reach a final resolution within 30 days after the
delivery of the Objections Statement to Buyer, Seller and Buyer will submit
any unresolved Disputed Items to Duff and Phelps, LLC, or if such firm is
unwilling or unable to serve, such other independent national accounting,
consulting or valuation firm mutually agreeable to Buyer and Seller (the
"Arbiter"). In the event the parties submit any unresolved Disputed Items to
the Arbiter, each party will submit a Closing Statement (which in the case of
each party may be a Closing Statement that, with respect to the unresolved
Disputed Items (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any other
items), is different than (but not more favorable to the submitting party
than) the Closing Statement initially submitted to Seller or the Objections
Statement delivered to Buyer, as applicable) together with such supporting
documentation as it deems appropriate, to the Arbiter within 10 days after the
date on which such unresolved Disputed Items were submitted to the Arbiter for
resolution. Seller and Buyer will use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Arbiter to resolve such dispute as soon as practicable,
but in any event within 30 days after the date on which the Arbiter receives
the Closing Statements prepared by Seller and Buyer. Seller and Buyer will not
engage in any ex-parte communication with the Arbiter. The Arbiter's
determination shall be based solely on the presentations by Buyer and Seller
that are in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this
Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review) and shall
determine a value for each Disputed Item which is equal to or between the
final values proposed by Buyer and Seller in their respective submissions. No
discovery will be permitted and no arbitration hearing will be held. The
resolution of the dispute by the Arbiter will be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto, and judgement may be entered upon the
determination of the Arbiter in any court having jurisdiction over the 3
LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt009.jpg) 

party against which such determination is to be enforced. Each party will bear
its own costs and expenses in connection with the resolution of such dispute
by the Arbiter. The costs and expenses of the Arbiter will be allocated based
upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to
each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party in the
presentation to the Arbiter. For example, if Seller submits an Objections
Statement for $1,000, and if Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by
Seller, and if the Arbiter ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Seller
$300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Arbiter will be
allocated 60% (i.e., 300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to Seller. (e)
If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.02(d) (the
"Final Purchase Price") is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price, then,
within five Business Days after the determination of Final Purchase Price, (i)
Buyer will pay an amount equal to such excess to the Escrow and Paying Agent
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, and the Escrow and Paying
Agent will pay to Seller such excess by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller to the Escrow and Paying
Agent, and (ii) Buyer and Seller will jointly instruct the Escrow and Paying
Agent to pay to Seller the Adjustment Escrow Funds, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to an account or accounts designated by Seller to
the Escrow and Paying Agent. If the Final Purchase Price equals the Estimated
Purchase Price, within five Business Days after determination of the Final
Purchase Price, Buyer and Seller will jointly instruct the Escrow and Paying
Agent to pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
Adjustment Escrow Funds to an account or accounts designated by Seller to the
Escrow and Paying Agent. (f) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the
Estimated Purchase Price (the amount by which the Final Purchase Price is less
than the Estimated Purchase Price, the "Shortfall"), then, within five
Business Days after the determination of the Final Purchase Price, Buyer and
Seller will jointly instruct the Escrow and Paying Agent to pay (i) to Buyer,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to such
Shortfall from (and up to the amount of) the Adjustment Escrow Funds, and (ii)
to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the remainder, if
any, of the Adjustment Escrow Funds, to an account or accounts designated by
Seller to the Escrow and Paying Agent; provided, that if the then remaining
Adjustment Escrow Funds are less than the aggregate amount of the Shortfall,
then Seller shall pay or cause to be paid an amount equal to the Shortfall
less the amount released to Buyer from the Adjustment Escrow Funds (such
amount, the "Remaining Shortfall"), or, in Buyer's sole discretion, Buyer may
elect for Buyer and Seller to jointly instruct the Escrow and Paying Agent to
pay to Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal
to the Remaining Shortfall from the Indemnity Escrow Funds. (g) All payments
required pursuant to Section 1.02(e) and Section 1.02(f) will be deemed to be
adjustments for Tax purposes to the Purchase Price. Section 1.03 The Closing.
The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing")
will take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, located at 300 North
LaSalle St., Chicago, Illinois, on the second Business Day following
satisfaction of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article II (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing)
(the "Scheduled Closing Date") or such other date as Buyer and Seller may
mutually agree; provided, that, in no event shall the Scheduled Closing Date
occur 4 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt010.jpg) 

prior to March 13, 2020 without Buyer's consent. The date of the Closing is
herein referred to as the "Closing Date." The Closing will be deemed to occur
at 12:01 A.M. Eastern time on the Closing Date. Section 1.04 Withholding.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, any
amounts payable in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby may be
reduced by any Tax withholding that is required by Law, and any amount so
withheld and paid to the applicable Governmental Body will be treated for all
purposes hereof as having been paid to the Person with respect to which the
withholding was made. Buyer will use commercially reasonably efforts to notify
Seller in writing of such intent to deduct and withhold at least three
Business Days prior to any deduction or withholding and will in good faith
reasonably cooperate with Seller to eliminate or otherwise reduce any such
deduction or withholding to the extent permitted by applicable Law. In the
case of any such payment treated as compensation, the parties will cooperate
to pay such amounts through the Target Companies' payroll to facilitate
applicable withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted
and timely paid to the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. ARTICLE II

obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions as of
the Closing Date: (a) No judgment, decree or order will have been entered by

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt011.jpg) 

(ii) Each of the representations and warranties of Seller and the Target
Companies contained in Article III and Article IV, respectively (other than
the Fundamental Representations), will be true and correct as of the Closing
Date as if made anew as of such date (except to the extent any such
representation and warranty expressly relates to an earlier date (in which
case as of such earlier date)), without giving effect to Qualifications

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;
(b) The Target Companies and Seller will have performed in all material
respects all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by them

payments to be made to Seller pursuant to this Agreement any required
withholding Tax under Section 1445 of the Code and Section 1446(f) of the

document retention policy, Buyer will not, and will not permit any Target
Company to, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any books and records

such books and records or such portions thereof. Notwithstanding the

adversarial proceeding between the parties as to such records or other
information directly pertinent to such dispute. Section 7.02 Employee Matters.
(a) For a period of no less than twelve (12) months from and after the Closing
Date, Buyer will provide, or will cause the applicable Target Company to
provide to: (i) the Business Employees as a group, employee benefits (other
than defined benefit pension, equity or equity based, deferred compensation,
and retiree or post-termination health or welfare benefits) which are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits (other than
defined benefit pension, equity or equity based, deferred compensation, and
retiree or post-termination health or welfare benefits) provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer; (ii) each Business Employee, base compensation
and short-term cash target incentive compensation (not including any deferred
compensation or equity or equity-based compensation) that are no less than the
base compensation and short-term cash target incentive compensation (not
including any deferred compensation or equity or equity-based compensation)
provided to such Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing; and (iii)
each Business Employee, severance benefits as determined under the severance
guidelines of Buyer but including for purposes of determining any such
benefits, the Business Employee's service after the Closing. (b) Effective as
of the Closing Date, each Business Employee will cease to be an active
participant under the Employee Plans and each of the Target Companies will
terminate its participation in each Employee Plan. Each Business Employee will
receive credit for service with the Target Companies under the employee
benefit plans and arrangements (other than equity or equity-based plans or
arrangements but including any severance plans or arrangements) of Buyer and
its Affiliates in which the Business Employees may participate during the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs (each, a "Buyer Plan") for
purposes of eligibility and vesting and the determination of any severance
amount; provided, however, that in no event will such credit result in the
duplication of benefits or compensation. In addition, Buyer will, or will
cause one of its Affiliates to: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to
(subject to the terms of the applicable Buyer Plan) waive, or will cause to be
waived, any limitations as to 41 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt047.jpg) 

pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability, exclusions and waiting
periods for Business Employees under such Buyer Plans that are group health
plans ("Buyer Health Plans") to the extent that such conditions, evidence of
insurability, exclusions and waiting periods were waived or already satisfied
under the Employee Plans in which the Business Employees participate as of the
Closing Date; and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer
Health Plans to recognize any out-of-pocket expenses paid by each of the
Business Employees and their eligible spouses and dependents under an Employee
Plan that is a medical, dental, vision or other group health plan during the
portion of any plan year prior to the date on which the Business Employees and
their eligible dependents become eligible to participate in such Buyer Health
Plans for purposes of determining deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums for such Business Employees and their eligible spouses and dependents
under any applicable Buyer Health Plans (and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide any such necessary information to Buyer for the
period at or prior to the Closing to the extent permitted by applicable Law).
(c) As of the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to honor and assume all accrued but
unused paid time off for each Business Employee pursuant to any Employee Plan
providing for paid time off as of the Closing Date solely to the extent such
amounts are taken into account in the calculation of Net Working Capital as
finally determined pursuant to Section 1.02(e) and Section 1.02(f). (d) During
the period between the date hereof and the Closing Date, Buyer shall be
permitted to engage in discussions with certain Business Employees to enter
into Retention Agreements and Protective Covenant Agreements to be effective
on or promptly following the Closing. (e) Nothing contained herein, express or
implied, is intended to confer any rights (including any third-party
beneficiary rights), remedies or claims upon any employee of any Target
Company, any Business Employee or any other Person other than the parties to
this Agreement, or will constitute an amendment to or any other modification
of any Employee Plan. Section 7.03 Director and Officer Liability and
Indemnification. (a) For a period of six years after the Closing, Buyer will
not, and will not permit any Target Company to, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in any Target Company's certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
other equivalent governing documents relating to the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses of any current and former officers
or directors (in each case in their capacities as such and not as
equityholders) (each, a "DandO Indemnified Person") (unless required by Law), it
being the intent of the parties that the DandO Indemnified Persons will continue
to be entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses to the full extent of the Law. (b) In addition to the other rights
provided for in this Section 7.03 and not in limitation thereof, from and
after the Closing, Buyer will, and will cause the Target Companies (each, a
"DandO Indemnifying Party") to, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless (and release from any Liability to Buyer
or the Target Companies), the DandO Indemnified Persons against all DandO Expenses
(as defined below), losses, claims, damages, judgments or amounts paid in
settlement (collectively, "DandO Costs") in respect 42 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt048.jpg) 

of any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding,
whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative, based on or arising
out or relating to the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer
of any Target Company (in their capacities as such and not as equityholders)
arising out of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing
(including in respect of acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby) (a "DandO Indemnifiable Claim") and
(ii) advance to such DandO Indemnified Persons all DandO Expenses incurred in
connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim (including in circumstances where
the DandO Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of such claim) promptly
after receipt of reasonably detailed statements therefor; provided, however,
that the Person to whom DandO Expenses are to be advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification. Any DandO Indemnifiable Claims will
continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is disposed of or all judgments,
orders, decrees or other rulings in connection with such DandO Indemnifiable
Claim are fully satisfied. For the purposes of this Section 7.03(b), "DandO
Expenses" will include attorneys' fees and all other costs, charges and
expenses paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a
witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend,
to be a witness in or participate in any DandO Indemnifiable Claim, but will
exclude losses, claims, damages, judgments and amounts paid in settlement
(which items are included in the definition of DandO Costs). (c) At the Closing,
Seller will, or will cause the Target Companies to, at Seller's expense,
obtain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance policies naming the DandO
Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least
six years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the Target Companies' current insurance carrier with
respect to directors' liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as
favorable as the Target Companies' existing policies with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date (including in respect of
acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby). Buyer will, and will cause the Target Companies to,
maintain such insurance policies and not cancel or change such insurance
policies in any respect. (d) Buyer hereby acknowledges (on behalf of itself
and its Subsidiaries) that the DandO Indemnified Persons may have certain rights
to indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance provided by current
equityholders or other Affiliates of Seller or their respective equityholders
("Indemnitee Affiliates") separate from the indemnification obligations of
Buyer hereunder. The parties hereto agree that (i) Buyer and the Target
Companies are the indemnitors of first resort (i.e., their obligations to the
DandO Indemnified Persons are primary and any obligation of any Indemnitee
Affiliate to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same
expenses or Liabilities incurred by the DandO Indemnified Persons are
secondary), (ii) subject to the other terms and conditions of this Section
7.03, Buyer and the Target Companies will be required to advance the full
amount of expenses incurred by the DandO Indemnified Persons and will be liable
for the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines and amounts
paid in settlement to the extent legally permitted, without regard to any
rights the DandO Indemnified Persons may have against any Indemnitee Affiliate,
and (iii) Buyer and the Target Companies irrevocably waive, relinquish and
release the Indemnitee Affiliates from any and all claims against the
Indemnitee Affiliates for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of
any kind in respect thereof. 43 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt049.jpg) 

(e) In the event that all or substantially all of the assets of any Target
Company are sold, whether in one transaction or a series of transactions, then
Buyer and the Target Companies will, in each such case, ensure that the
successors and assigns of the Target Companies, as applicable, assume the

7.03(e) will apply to all of the successors and assigns of the Target
Companies. Section 7.04 Regulatory Filings. (a) To the extent required, Buyer

such information and providing such assistance as may be reasonably necessary
in connection with the foregoing. (d) Except as specifically required by this
Agreement, Buyer will not take any action, or refrain from taking any action,
the effect of which would be to delay or impede the ability of the parties
hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Buyer will not, and will not permit any of
its Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire (by merging or consolidating
with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or
by any other manner), any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into a definitive agreement

obtaining, any Permits, orders or other approvals of any Governmental Body

conditioned or delayed); provided, that the foregoing will not prohibit Buyer
or any of its employees or agents from contacting such persons in the ordinary
course of Buyer's business unrelated to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; and provided, further, that the foregoing will not
restrict Buyer from undertaking employee onboarding activities consistent with
the terms and conditions of Section 7.02 hereof. Section 7.07 Payment of

hand, hereby terminate any and all Contracts, intercompany balances, accounts
payable or accounts receivable between or among any Target Company, on the one
hand, and Seller and its controlled Affiliates (other than the Target
Companies), on the other hand, effective without further action as of the
Closing. Except as set forth on Schedule 7.10, no such Contract (including any
provision thereof which purports to survive termination), intercompany

receivables as of immediately prior to the Closing will be netted against each
other and the net balance will be a deemed dividend to Seller or, if
applicable, contributed to the capital of the applicable Target Company, in
either case without further action. Each party will, at the reasonable request
of any other party, take, or cause to be taken, such other actions as may be
necessary to effect the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of this Section 7.10 will not apply to this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. Section 7.11 Assignment of Certain Rights and

6.15 of the EIS Purchase Agreement, and (b) Buyer shall assume and hold Seller
harmless from all liabilities of Seller under the EIS Purchase Agreement that
directly arise out of Buyer exercising, or taking actions with respect to, any
such rights and interests under the EIS Purchase Agreement; provided, that
Seller shall not assign, and Buyer shall not be entitled to any rights or
interests, or the right to take any action(s), with respect to, any rights or
interests of Seller with respect to any "Tax" under the EIS Purchase
Agreement, except any rights or interests of Seller provided under Section

received by the Target Companies) and Section 10.7(b)) and solely as such
rights or interests relate to the Business. Section 7.12 Occurrence-Based
Insurance. Following the Closing, subject to the provisions of this Section
7.12, any Buyer Related Party may make an insurance claim (to the extent that
coverage exists when such claim is made) for any event or Liabilities caused
by, arising from or relating to the operation of the businesses of the Target
Companies that occurred prior to Closing (each, a "Buyer Occurrence-Based
Insurance Claim") under the appropriate occurrence- based liability insurance
policies of Seller, but solely relating to general liability, workers'
compensation, auto, excess liability, property, cargo and transit occurrence-
based liability insurance policies (each a "Seller Occurrence-Based Insurance
Policy") that, subject to the terms and limitations of such Seller Occurrence-
Based Insurance Policy, covered such Buyer Indemnified Party for such Buyer
Occurrence-Based Insurance Claim at the time of such event; provided; that (a)
such Buyer Occurrence-Based Insurance Claim will be made by such Buyer Related
Party at the Buyer Related Party's sole cost and expense and (b) such Buyer

costs) and all deductibles and retentions and all uninsured, uncovered,
unavailable or uncollectable amounts relating to or associated with such Buyer
Occurrence-Based Insurance Claim. For the purpose of making such Buyer
Occurrence-Based Insurance Claim, and upon the reasonable written request of
such Buyer Related Party, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts, at
such Buyer Related Party's sole out-of-pocket cost and expense, to cooperate
with such Buyer Related Party by providing a copy of such Seller Occurrence-
Based Insurance Policy and other information reasonably requested by such
Buyer Related Party regarding such Seller Occurrence-Based Insurance Policy
and making the claim on behalf of such Buyer Related Party if such Buyer

Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: (a) by the
mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller; (b) by Buyer, if there has been a
material violation or breach by the Target Companies or Seller of any
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of
Buyer at the Closing and such violation or breach is incapable of being cured
prior to the End Date or has not been waived by Buyer or, in the case of a
covenant or agreement breach, cured by the Target Companies or Seller, as
applicable, within 10 days after written notice thereof from Buyer; provided,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(b)
will not be available to Buyer if it is then in breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement so as to cause
the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 2.03(a) or 2.03(b) not to be
satisfied at such time; (c) by Seller, (i) if there has been a material
violation or breach by Buyer of any covenant, agreement, representation or

End Date or has not been waived by Seller or, in the case of a covenant or
agreement breach, cured by Buyer within 10 days after written notice thereof
by Seller (provided that neither a breach by Buyer of Section 5.08 nor the
failure to deliver the full consideration payable pursuant to Article I under
this Agreement at the Closing as required hereunder will be subject to cure
hereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller) or (ii) the Closing
has not occurred within two Business Days of the Scheduled Closing Date;
provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.01(c) will not be available to Seller if Seller or the Target Companies are
then in breach of any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement so as to cause the conditions to Closing set forth
in Sections 2.02(a) or 2.02(b) not to be satisfied at such time; or (d) by
either Buyer or Seller if the transactions contemplated hereby have not been
consummated by 5:00 P.M. Eastern time on April 15, 2020 (the "End Date");
provided that neither Buyer nor Seller will be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 50 LEGAL02/39540989v11

8.01(d) if such Person's willful breach or willful failure to comply with such
Person's obligations under this Agreement has prevented the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Section 8.02 Effect of Termination. In
the event of the termination of this Agreement by either Buyer or Seller as
provided above, the provisions of this Agreement will immediately become void
and of no further force or effect (other than this Section 8.02 and Article XI
hereof which will survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
their terms; provided, however, that the confidentiality agreement, dated
October 15, 2019, by and between the Guarantor and Robert W. Baird and Co.
Incorporated, as agent for the Target Companies (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), will survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of
five years following the date of such termination (and, notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement to the
contrary, the Confidentiality Agreement term will be automatically amended to
be extended for such additional five year period)), and there will be no
Liability on the part of any of the parties to one another; provided, however,
that the termination of this Agreement will not relieve any party from any
Liability incurred or suffered by any other party as a result of any willful
breach or willful failure to perform any covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement and, in
addition, in the event of any termination of this Agreement and a related
action for such willful breach or willful failure, the prevailing party or
parties will be reimbursed by the other party or parties to the action for
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket attorneys' fees and expenses relating
to such action. Nothing in this Article VIII will be deemed to impair the
right of any party to compel specific performance by another party of its
obligations under this Agreement. Any claim which the Target Companies or
Seller may have in connection with a termination of this Agreement will be
enforceable by the Target Companies or Seller for the benefit of all such
Persons. ARTICLE IX ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS Section 9.01 Survival.
The representations and warranties contained in Article III, Article IV, and
Article V (other than the Fundamental Representations and the Tax

Section 2.03 will survive the Closing and will terminate and be of no further
force and effect on the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date. The
Fundamental Representations and the Tax Representations will survive the
Closing and will terminate and be of no further force and effect on the date
that is 36 months after the Closing Date. The covenants and agreements

Agreement that require performance after the Closing will survive the Closing
in accordance with the terms thereof and until performance is completed;
provided that the covenant and agreement set forth in Section 9.02(a)(iii)

hereunder for breach of any such representations, warranties, covenants, or
agreements may be made after the expiration of such applicable survival

From and after the Closing (but subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article IX), the Buyer Related Parties will be indemnified in respect of any
actual and reasonable out-of-pocket loss (hereinafter individually a "Loss"
and collectively "Losses") suffered or incurred by any such Buyer Related
Party to the extent such Loss directly results from (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller or the Target Companies contained in

2.02, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this
Agreement requiring performance by Seller after the Closing (the "Post-Closing
Covenants"), or (iii) Indemnified Taxes. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, even if a Buyer Related Party would
otherwise be entitled to recover a Loss pursuant to this Agreement: (i) no
Buyer Related Party will be entitled to any indemnification under Section
9.02(a)(i) for a Loss if, with respect to any individual item (or group of
related items) of Loss, such item is less than $25,000 (a "Minor Claim");
provided, that this Section 9.02(b)(i) will not apply to any breach of any
Fundamental Representation or Tax Representation; (ii) no Buyer Related Party
will be entitled to any indemnification under Section 9.02(a)(i) unless the
aggregate amount of all Losses (excluding Minor Claims) relating to a breach
of any representation or warranty of the Target Companies or Seller contained
in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.02
would exceed, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to $500,000 (the

provided, however, that this Section 9.02(b)(ii) will not apply to any breach
of any Fundamental Representation or Tax Representation; (iii) the aggregate
amount of all Losses for which the Buyer Related Parties will be entitled to

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt058.jpg) 

(c) From and after the Closing (but subject to the terms and conditions of
this Article IX), any indemnification or other claims of the Buyer Related
Parties will (i) first be paid from funds available in the Indemnity Escrow
Account and (ii) thereafter will be paid by Seller. (d) Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Seller will have no
obligation to indemnify any of the Buyer Related Parties from and against any
Taxes of any Person (i) for any Post-Closing Tax Period (or any other Losses
directly related to any such Taxes), other than Taxes that result from a
breach of Section 4.13(i) or (ii) that are attributable to (A) any transaction
occurring on the Closing Date after the Closing, (B) any taxable income or
gain recognized by the Target Companies that is attributable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, the manner in which
Buyer finances such transactions, but excluding the settlement of Contracts,
intercompany balances, accounts receivable or accounts payable pursuant to
Section 7.10), or (C) the unavailability in any taxable period (or portion
hereof) beginning after the Closing Date of any net operating losses, credits
or other Tax attribute from a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or
prior to the Closing Date. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, for purposes of determining whether there has
been a breach and the amount of any Losses that are the subject matter of a
claim pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) or Section 9.03(a)(i), each such
representation and warranty shall be read without regard to and without giving
effect to any Qualification contained in such representation or warranty (as
if such Qualification were deleted from such representation or warranty). (f)
All payments under this Section 9.02 will be treated by the parties as an
adjustment to the proceeds received by Seller pursuant to Article I. The
parties agree that the Indemnity Escrow Account will be treated as a
contingent installment obligation for United States federal and all applicable
United States state and local income Tax purposes, and that Buyer will be
obligated to report all income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from,
the Indemnity Escrow Account as income of Buyer in the taxable year or years
in which such income is properly includible, and will be obligated to pay any
Taxes attributable thereto. Each of the parties will file all Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the foregoing. Section 9.03 Indemnification for the
Benefit of the Seller Related Parties. From and after the Closing (but subject
to the provisions of this Article IX), Buyer will indemnify the Seller Related
Parties against and hold them harmless from any Losses suffered or incurred by
the Seller Related Parties to the extent such Loss directly results from (i)
any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in Article V
or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer or the Target
Companies contained in this Agreement requiring performance by Buyer or the
Target Companies after the Closing. All payments under this Section 9.03 will
be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the proceeds received by Seller
pursuant to Article I. Any indemnification of the Seller Related Parties
pursuant to this Section 9.03 will be effected by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts and in the amounts designated by
Seller in writing. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, even if a Seller Related Party would otherwise be entitled to
recover a Loss pursuant to this Agreement: 53 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt059.jpg)

9.03(a)(i) will not apply to any breach of any Buyer Fundamental
Representation; (ii) no Seller Related Party will be entitled to any
indemnification under Section 9.03(i) unless the aggregate amount of all
Losses (excluding Minor Claims) relating to a breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement would exceed, on a cumulative

Losses exceed the Deductible; provided, however, that this Section 9.03(a)(ii)

obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto in respect of a
breach of representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement will terminate on
the applicable survival termination date (as set forth in Section 9.01),
unless, with respect to a representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement
that terminates following the Closing Date, an Indemnified Party has incurred
a Loss prior to such applicable survival termination date and made a proper
claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02 or Section 9.03, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Article IX (including application of
Alternative Arrangements as required by Section 9.07(a)), prior to such
termination date, as applicable, including by delivering a written notice
(stating in reasonable detail to the extent known by the Indemnified Party the
amount of the Losses and details of and the method of computation thereof, the
nature of, and factual and legal basis for, any such claim for
indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim
for indemnification is made) to the Indemnifying Party. If an Indemnified
Party has made a proper claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article IX
prior to such termination date, then such claim for such Loss incurred (and
after giving effect to any reductions for Alternative Arrangements pursuant to
Section 9.07(a)), and only such claim for such Loss as reduced after giving
effect to such reductions incurred, if then unresolved, will not be
extinguished by the passage of the deadlines set forth in Section 9.01
(notwithstanding any potential expiration of any applicable statute of
limitations). Section 9.05 Procedures Relating to Indemnification. (a) Except
with regards to Tax Proceedings, which for the avoidance of doubt, shall be
governed by the provisions of Section 9.09(g), in order for any Buyer Related
Party 54 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt060.jpg) 

(in such capacity, the "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of a claim or
demand made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third-Party
Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party (the
"Indemnifying Party") in writing, describing in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to such Third-Party Claim and the amount or method of computation
of the amount of such Third-Party Claim (if known), of the Third-Party Claim
as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt, but in no event later than
30 days after receipt, by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third-Party
Claim; provided that failure to give such notification on a timely basis will
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party will have been materially and adversely prejudiced as a
result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party will deliver to the
Indemnifying Party, within five days after the Indemnified Party's receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim and such other
information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request. (b) Except with regards to Tax Proceedings, which for the avoidance
of doubt, shall be governed by the provisions of Section 9.09(g), any
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense of a Third-
Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party's expense, and at its option will be
entitled to assume the defense thereof, upon written notice to the Indemnified
Party (except that the defense or prosecution of such claim shall be tendered
to the insurance carrier of the RandW Insurance Policy if such carrier has
assumed the defense thereof under the RandW Insurance Policy), by appointing its
own counsel to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense, which
counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided
that the Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in the defense of
such Third-Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose
(it being understood that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel will
be borne solely by the Indemnified Party). Such written notice to assume the
defense of any Third-Party Claim will include a certification that the
Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against the
entirety of any Losses the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from,
arising out of, relating to or caused by such Third-Party Claim (subject to
the limitations in this Article IX); provided that, the Indemnifying Party
will not be entitled to assume the defense (and continue the defense) (i)
unless the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
will have the financial resources to defend against such Third-Party Claim,
(ii) unless such Third-Party Claim involves only money damages and does not
seek an injunction or other equitable relief, (iii) if such Third-Party Claim
involves a criminal or quasi criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation, (iv) if the settlement of, or any adverse order
with respect to, such Third-Party Claim is, in the good faith judgment of the
Indemnified Party, likely to establish a precedent custom or practice
materially adverse to the continuing business interests of the Indemnified
Party, (v) if such Third Party Claim is related to an existing customer or
supplier of the Business, (vi) if such Third Party Claim involves any
allegations that could adversely affect Buyer\'s ownership or other rights in
and to the Company Owned Intellectual Property, and (vii) unless the
Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of such Third-Party Claim actively and
diligently in accordance with the advice of such Indemnifying Party's legal
counsel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 55 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt061.jpg) 

with respect to any Third-Party Claim for which the Buyer Related Parties are
seeking indemnification hereunder, if, based on the limitations in this
Article IX, the applicable Buyer Related Party reasonably determines that the
potential Losses associated with such Third-Party Claim would be borne to a
greater extent by the Buyer Related Parties (including as a result of a claim
made pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy) than by Seller, then Seller will
not be entitled to assume the defense or continue the defense of such Third-
Party Claim. (c) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such
Third-Party Claim then the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to settle such
Third-Party Claim; provided that the Indemnifying Party will obtain the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any
settlement of a Third-Party Claim if, (A) (i) such settlement does not contain
a full and unconditional release of the Indemnified Parties and their
Affiliates from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third-
Party Claim (except for payments that would be required to be paid by Buyer
representing the Deductible) (ii) such settlement does not include a
reasonable confidentiality obligation by the third-party claimant of the terms
of the settlement, (iii) the Indemnified Party is not an express third-party
beneficiary of the settlement agreement, entitled to enforce such settlement
agreement or (iv) the consent of the carrier of the RandW Insurance Policy is
required under the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy, or (B) would result in
(i) the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would
restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party, (ii) a
finding or admission or a violation of Law or violation of the rights of any
Person by the Indemnified Party, (iii) a finding or admission that would have
an adverse effect on other claims made or threatened against the Indemnified
Party or the businesses of the Indemnified Parties, or (iv) any monetary
liability of the Indemnified Party that will not be promptly paid or
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party (except for payments that would be
required to be paid by Buyer representing the Deductible). (d) If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, all the
parties will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense.
Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's
request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information
which are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees
and other representatives and advisors available on a mutually convenient
basis (and during normal business hours at reasonable locations) to provide
additional information and explanation of any information provided hereunder.
Whether or not Seller will have assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim
hereunder, no Buyer Related Party will admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, any Third-Party Claim hereunder without the
prior written consent of Seller (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), or pursuant to the RandW Insurance Policy, if
applicable. The consent of Seller is required for any act on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties in the case of all Third-Party Claims with respect to
which any Buyer Related Party is seeking indemnification pursuant to Section
9.02. 56 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt062.jpg) 

(e) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third-Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party will deliver notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party,
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for
indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of computation of the amount
of such claim (if known) and such other information with respect thereto as
the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to provide such
notice, however, will not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article X except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially and adversely prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnified
Party will reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in
determining the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party
and in otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation will
including providing, in each case during normal business hours at reasonable
locations, reasonable access to and copies of information, records and
documents relating to such matters, furnishing employees to assist in the
investigation, defense and resolution of such matters and providing assistance
with respect to such matters to the extent reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party. Section 9.06 Mitigation. Any Indemnified Party that
becomes aware of a Loss for which it seeks indemnification under this Article
IX will, solely to the extent required by applicable Law, be required to use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such Loss; provided that no party
shall be required to institute any Proceeding against any third-party. Section
9.07 Determination of Loss Amount. (a) The amount of any Losses subject to
indemnification under Section 9.02 and Section 9.03 will be calculated net of
any amounts actually recovered in cash by any Indemnified Party or any of such
Indemnified Party's Affiliates under or pursuant to any insurance policy
(excluding any recovery received under the RandW Insurance Policy), title
insurance policy, indemnity, reimbursement arrangement or contract pursuant to
or under which such Indemnified Party or such Indemnified Party's Affiliates
is a party or has rights, net of any deductible amounts, costs of collection
or recovery, increases in premiums and reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses related thereto (collectively, "Alternative Arrangements"). Without
limiting the foregoing, the Buyer Related Parties will have no right to assert
any claims, and the Buyer Related Parties will not be entitled to
indemnification, with respect to any Losses that are covered by an Alternative
Arrangement or would have been covered by an Alternative Arrangement had the
Buyer Related Parties maintained for their benefit and the benefit of the
Target Companies the same rights or coverage under an Alternative Arrangement
following the Closing that was in effect for the Target Companies immediately
prior to the Closing. The Indemnified Party will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all Alternative Arrangements
covering any Loss to the same extent as such Indemnified Party would if such
Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that a
recovery is made under an Alternative Arrangement (excluding the RandW Insurance
Policy) by any Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss for which such
Indemnified Party has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery net of collection costs and net of any
portion of the Loss borne by the 57 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt063.jpg) 

Indemnified Party (but not to exceed the amount previously indemnified by the
Indemnifying Party) will be made promptly to the Indemnifying Party. (b) No
Buyer Related Party will be entitled to any indemnification under this Article
IX to the extent (i) such matter was taken into account in determining the
Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.02, or (ii) a Buyer Related Party
has been otherwise compensated for such matter pursuant to this Agreement.
Section 9.08 Exclusive Remedy. (a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, from
and after the Closing, excluding (i) claims for equitable relief as expressly
set forth in this Agreement or (ii) any post- Closing adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.02, Buyer Related Parties' sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating (directly or
indirectly) to the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, regardless of the legal theory under which such liability
or obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or
tort, or whether at law or in equity, or otherwise, will be for breach of
contract only (as such contractual remedies have been further limited or
excluded pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement) to the extent a
claim may be made pursuant to the provisions set forth in this Article IX and
the Buyer Related Parties will have no other remedy or recourse with respect
to any of the foregoing other than pursuant to, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, Section 9.02. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section
9.08(a) does not limit the Buyer Related Parties' right to enforce any of the
Ancillary Agreements or the Restrictive Covenant Agreements in accordance with
their respective terms. (b) The parties hereto agree that the provisions in
this Agreement relating to indemnification, and the limits imposed on Buyer's
remedies with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby were specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were
specifically taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid
to Seller hereunder. (c) Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of

causes of action, claims, demands, damages, losses, liabilities, judgments,
debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and description whatsoever, in law
or in equity, which such Seller Releasor or its heirs, legal representatives,
successors or assigns ever had, now has or may in the future have on or by
reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 9.08(c) to the contrary,
the releases set forth in this Section 9.08(c) shall not affect or release the
obligations of Buyer, the Target Companies or their respective Affiliates
under this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, any other Ancillary
Agreement or any of the Internal Reorganization Documents. Each Seller
Releasor covenants and agrees not to, nor shall any Seller Releasor cause its
respective Affiliates to, assert any such claim against any Buyer Releasee. 58
LEGAL02/39540989v11

(d) Effective as of the Closing, the Buyer, on behalf of itself and its

discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Seller and its Affiliates
and each of their respective past, present or future officers, managers,

debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and description whatsoever, in law
or in equity, which such Buyer Releasor or its heirs, legal representatives,
successors or assigns ever had, now has or may in the future have on or by

prepare or cause to be prepared, and timely file or cause to be timely filed,
all Tax Returns for the Target Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period the due date of which (taking into account extensions of time
to file) is after the Closing Date but, for any such Tax Return with respect
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, only if not filed prior to Closing. Buyer will
timely pay, or cause to be timely paid, any amount shown as due on such Tax
Returns. All such Tax Returns that are with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods
will be prepared in a manner consistent with the past custom and practice of
the Target Companies, except as otherwise required by a change in applicable
Law; provided that, with respect to the preparation and filing of the Tax
Returns under this Section 9.09(a)(i) with respect to Income Taxes, (A) such
Tax Returns will reflect all applicable Tax deductions for Transaction Tax
Deductions in the Pre-Closing Tax Period so long as such Transaction Tax
Deductions are "more likely than not" deductible (or deductible at a higher
confidence level) in the Pre- Closing Tax Period of the Target Companies and,
for that purpose, the parties hereto agree that the safe-harbor election of
Rev. Proc. 2011-29 will be made with respect to any Transaction Tax Deduction
that is a success-based fee, (B) any financing or refinancing arrangements
entered into at any time by or at the direction of Buyer or its Affiliates or

gain, loss and deduction attributable to transactions outside the ordinary
course of business on the Closing Date after the time of the Closing will not
be taken into account in the Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer will 59
LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt065.jpg) 

not, and will not permit the Target Companies or any of its Subsidiaries to,
waive any carryback of any net operating loss, capital loss or credit on any
such Tax Return. At least 30 days prior to the date on which each Tax Return
is due, Buyer will submit such Tax Return to Seller for Seller's review and
comment, and (x) Buyer shall incorporate any such comments that are with
respect to any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle
Period), and (y) Buyer shall reasonably consider in good faith any such
comments that are with respect to any Tax Return for a Straddle Period;
provided that, with respect to any Tax Return for which indemnification may
reasonably be claimed by Buyer Related Parties against Seller hereunder,
Seller shall have a right to review and approve any such Tax Returns (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). (ii) For
the portion of the day of the Closing after the time of Closing, other than
the transactions expressly contemplated hereby, Buyer will cause the Target
Companies to carry on their business only in the ordinary course in the same
manner as heretofore conducted and will not convert or otherwise change the
form of any of the Target Companies under applicable state, local or foreign
law. The Target Companies will elect with the relevant Taxing Authority to
treat for all purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period of
the Target Companies. The parties agree that Buyer and its Affiliates and the
Target Companies (x) will not make an election under Treasury Regulation
§1.1502- 76(b)(2)(ii)(D) to ratably allocate items (or make any similar
election or ratably allocate items under any corresponding or equivalent
provision of state, local or foreign law) and (y) will not apply the "next
day" rule of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any
corresponding or equivalent provision of state, local or foreign law) with
respect to any of the Transaction Tax Deductions. (b) Books and Records;
Cooperation. Without limiting Section 9.10, Buyer and Seller will, and will
cause their respective representatives to, cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, and shall specifically (i)
provide the other party and their representatives with such assistance as may
be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation and review of any
Tax Return or any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority or
judicial or administrative proceeding relating to Taxes with respect to any
Target Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, including to make any Push-Out
Elections, and (ii) retain and provide the other party and their
representatives with reasonable access to all records or information that may
be relevant to any Tax Proceeding. (c) Transfer Taxes. Buyer will pay, and
will indemnify and hold Seller harmless against, any real property transfer or
gains tax, stamp tax, stock transfer tax, or other similar Tax imposed on any
Target Company or Seller as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes"), and any penalties, interest or
additions to Tax with respect to the Transfer Taxes. Seller agrees to
cooperate with Buyer in the filing of any returns with respect to the Transfer
Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in its possession that is
reasonably necessary to complete such returns. (d) [Reserved] 60

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt066.jpg) 

(e) Post-Closing Tax Matters. Buyer will not cause or permit the Target
Companies or any of their Affiliates to (i) file or amend or otherwise modify
any Tax Return that relates in whole or in part to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(other than to file Tax Returns in accordance with Section 9.09(a)), (ii) make
or change any election or accounting method or practice with respect to, or
that has retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) voluntarily
approach any Taxing Authority (including with respect to any voluntary
disclosure agreement or similar process) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (iv) extend or
waive the statute of limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax
with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. (f) Straddle Period Allocation. To
the extent it is necessary for purposes of this Agreement to determine the
allocation of Taxes among a Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes based on
or measured by income, receipts, payroll or sales of the Target Companies for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based on an interim closing of
the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such
purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass through entity in
which any Target Company holds a beneficial interest will be deemed to
terminate at such time) and the amount of other Taxes of the Target Companies
for a Straddle Period that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be
deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in such Straddle Period. (g) Tax Proceedings. After the Closing, the
Target Companies and Buyer will promptly notify Seller in writing upon
receiving notice from any Taxing Authority of the commencement of any claim,
audit, examination, or administrative or court proceeding relating to any
audits or assessments or other disputes regarding any Taxes or any Tax Return
filed by any of the Target Companies with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
if Seller would reasonably be expected to have an indemnification obligation
under this Agreement with respect thereto (a "Tax Proceeding"). Seller may
elect to control and assume the defense of all proceedings in connection with
any Tax Proceeding; provided, that Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed
of the status of any such Tax Proceeding, defend any such Tax Proceeding as if
it were the only party in interest with respect to such Tax Proceeding, and
will not consent to the entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise or
discharge any such Tax Proceeding, without the prior written consent of Buyer
(which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If Seller
elects not to control such Tax Proceeding pursuant to the preceding sentence,
Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed of the status of any such Tax
Proceeding, defend any such Tax Proceeding as if it were the only party in
interest with respect to such Tax Proceeding, and will not consent to the
entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise or discharge any such Tax
Proceeding without the prior written consent of Seller (which will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). (h) Tax Treatment; Allocation
of Purchase Price. The parties agree to treat the acquisition of the Acquired
Equity pursuant to this Agreement as a taxable purchase of assets (and
assumption of applicable liabilities) for U.S. federal and applicable state
and local income tax purposes. The Purchase Price (and any adjustments thereto
in accordance with this Agreement), the relevant portion of liabilities of the
Target Companies and any other amounts treated as consideration deemed to be
transferred by Seller will be allocated among the assets of 61

this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, such provision will be

as material or threatened) or is within or outside of the ordinary course of
business for purposes of this Agreement. The information contained in this

resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth therein) or other claims
seeking injunctive relief (for which the provisions of Section 11.12, Section

claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise),
including the arbitrability of any dispute or controversy that cannot be
settled by mutual agreement will be finally settled by binding arbitration in
accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures
("JAMS"), as follows: any party hereto aggrieved will deliver a notice to the
other party setting forth the specific points in dispute. Any points remaining
in dispute 20 days after the giving of such notice may, upon 10 days' notice
to the other party, be submitted to JAMS arbitration conducted before a panel
of three arbitrators in Boston, Massachusetts. Buyer and Seller will each
appoint one arbitrator (the "Party-Appointed Arbitrators") and the Party-
Appointed Arbitrators will appoint the third and presiding arbitrator within
14 days of the appointment of the second arbitrator; provided, that, any
arbitrator not timely appointed herein will be appointed by JAMS upon the
written demand of any party to the dispute. The arbitrators may enter a
default decision against any party who fails to participate in the arbitration
proceedings. (b) The decision of the arbitrators on the points in dispute will
be final, unappealable and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered
in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrators will only be
authorized to interpret the provisions of this Agreement, and will not amend,
change or add to any such provisions. The parties hereto agree that this
provision has been adopted by the parties to rapidly and inexpensively resolve
any 85 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt091.jpg) 

disputes between them and that this provision will be grounds for dismissal of
any court action commenced by any party with respect to this Agreement (other
than disputes, controversies or claims arising under Section 1.02 (which will
be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth therein) or other
claims seeking injunctive relief (for which the provisions of Section 11.12,

court determines that this arbitration procedure is not binding, or otherwise
allows any litigation regarding a dispute, claim, or controversy covered by
this Agreement to proceed, the parties hereto hereby waive any and all right
to a trial by jury in or with respect to such litigation. (c) The arbitrators
will be authorized to apportion their fees and expenses as the arbitrators

proceeding will be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware state or

equity. The application of a party to an above-mentioned judicial authority
for such measures or for the implementation of any such measures ordered by an
arbitral tribunal will not be deemed to be an infringement or a waiver of
Section 11.14 and will not affect the relevant powers reserved to the arbitral
tribunal. Section 11.15 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Certain provisions of
this Agreement are intended for the benefit of Audax and the DandO Indemnified
Persons. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing expressed or
referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than

Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. Section 11.16 Representation of

Ellis LLP has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging
in such representation and (ii) agree that, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between Buyer or any Target Company and Seller or any of

Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of such Person(s) may be
directly adverse to Buyer or any Target Company and even though Kirkland and
Ellis LLP may have represented a Target Company or other Persons in a matter
substantially related to such dispute and may be handling other ongoing
matters for a Buyer Related Party, the Target Companies, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries. Buyer represents that Buyer's own attorney has
explained and helped Buyer evaluate the implications and risks of waiving the
right to assert a future conflict against Kirkland and Ellis LLP, and Buyer's
consent with respect to this waiver is fully informed. Buyer and the Target
Companies also further agree that, as to all communications among Kirkland and
Ellis LLP, on the one hand, and the Target Companies, and Seller or any of
Seller's Affiliates and representatives, on the other hand, that relate in any
way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Seller and may

Target Company. In addition, if the Closing occurs, all of the client files
and records in the possession of Kirkland and Ellis LLP related to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will continue to be

any copies of such records or have any access to them. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer and the Target Companies, on behalf of themselves, their
Affiliates, Subsidiaries and their respective current and future members,
partners, equityholders, representatives and each of the successors and
assigns of the foregoing (the "Waiving Parties"), hereby acknowledge and agree

this Agreement or any agreement entered into in connection with herewith or
related hereto (including all prior drafts), the assets, Liabilities,
operations, prospects and condition of any Target Company and their businesses

other privilege) and (y) documents or materials created prior to Closing by or
on behalf of any Seller Related Party or any Target Company in connection
with, in preparation for, related to or arising out of the sale process, any
prior sale processes, this Agreement or any agreement entered into in
connection herewith or related hereto (including all prior drafts) and the
subject matter hereof and thereof, or any dispute or proceeding arising out of
or relating to, the sale process, this Agreement, any agreement entered into
in connection herewith, the transactions contemplated hereby or any matter
relating to any of the foregoing, will be exclusively owned and controlled by
Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by Buyer, any Target Company and
from and after the Closing none of Buyer, the Target Companies or any other
Person purporting to act on behalf thereof or any of the Waiving Parties will
seek to access, obtain, use, rely on or otherwise disclose the same, without
in each case first obtaining Seller's consent, which may be granted or
withheld in its sole discretion, except in the event of a dispute arising
under or relating to this Agreement or the other Ancillary Agreements. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that it would be impractical
to remove all such emails and communications from the records (including
emails and other 87 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt093.jpg) 

electronic files) of any Target Company and that any possession of Buyer of
any of the foregoing will not affect or alter the ownership of such emails and
communications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between Buyer or any Target Company and a third party other than a
party to this Agreement (or an Affiliate thereof) after the Closing, the
Target Companies may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by Kirkland and Ellis LLP to such
third party; provided, however, that no Target Company may waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of Seller. Section 11.17 No
Additional Representations; Disclaimer; Non-Recourse. (a) Buyer acknowledges
that it has conducted to its satisfaction an independent investigation and
verification of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
Liabilities, properties and projected operations of the Target Companies, and,
in making its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Buyer has relied solely on the results of its own independent
investigation and verification and the representations and warranties of
Seller and the Target Companies expressly and specifically set forth in
Article III and Article IV, respectively, as qualified by the Disclosure
Schedules. The representations and warranties of Seller and the Target
Companies expressly and specifically set forth in Article III and Article IV,
respectively, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedules, and in the Ancillary
Agreements, constitute the sole and exclusive representations, warranties, and
statements of any kind of Seller and the Target Companies to Buyer in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and Buyer understands,
acknowledges and agrees that all other representations, warranties, and
statements of any kind or nature expressed or implied (including any relating
to the future or historical financial condition, results of operations,
prospects, assets or Liabilities of the Target Companies, or the quality,
quantity or condition of the Target Companies assets) are specifically
disclaimed by the Target Companies and Seller. All representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement are contractual in nature only and
subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set forth herein. The parties have
agreed that should any representations and warranties of any party prove
untrue, the other party will have the specific rights and remedies herein
specified as the exclusive remedy therefor, but that no other rights, remedies
or causes of action (whether in law or in equity or whether in contract or in
tort) are permitted to any party hereto as a result of the untruth of any such
representation and warranty. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
ARTICLE III OR ARTICLE IV OR IN ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT, NEITHER SELLER NOR
THE TARGET COMPANIES MAKE OR PROVIDE, AND BUYER HEREBY WAIVES, ANY WARRANTY OR
REPRESENTATION, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONFORMITY TO SAMPLES, OR CONDITION OF THE
TARGET COMPANIES' ASSETS OR ANY PART THEREOF. BUYER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND
THE TARGET COMPANIES EXPRESSLY AND SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE III AND
ARTICLE IV, RESPECTIVELY, AS QUALIFIED BY THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES, AND IN THE
ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS, (X) BUYER IS ACQUIRING THE TARGET COMPANIES ON AN "AS
IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND (Y) NEITHER SELLER NOR THE TARGET COMPANIES OR ANY
OTHER PERSON (INCLUDING, ANY STOCKHOLDER, MEMBER, OFFICER, DIRECTOR, EMPLOYEE
OR AGENT OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING, WHETHER IN ANY INDIVIDUAL, CORPORATE OR ANY
OTHER CAPACITY) IS MAKING, AND BUYER IS NOT RELYING ON, ANY 88

REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR OTHER STATEMENTS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER,
WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AS TO ANY
MATTER CONCERNING THE TARGET COMPANIES, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION
PROVIDED TO (OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRED BY) BUYER OR ANY OF BUYER'S
REPRESENTATIVES. (b) This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claim or suit based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought
against the named parties to this Agreement and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to the named parties in
this Agreement. No Person who is not a named party to this Agreement,
including any past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of the Target Companies, Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates, will have or be subject to any Liability or indemnification
obligation (whether in contract or in tort) to Buyer or any other Person
resulting from (nor will Buyer have any claim with respect to) (i) the
distribution to Buyer, or Buyer's use of, or reliance on, any information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Buyer in
certain "data rooms," confidential information memoranda or management
presentations in expectation of, or in connection with, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the sale and purchase of the Target Companies, including any
alleged non-disclosure or misrepresentations made by any such Persons, in each
case, regardless of the legal theory under which such Liability or obligation
may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort, or whether
at Law or in equity, or otherwise; and each party hereto waives and releases
all such Liabilities and obligations against any such Persons. (c) In
connection with the investigation by Buyer of the Target Companies, Buyer has
received or may receive from the Target Companies certain projections,
forward- looking statements and other forecasts and certain business plan
information. Buyer acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans,
that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts or plans), and that Buyer will have no claim against
anyone with respect thereto. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that, except to
the extent expressly set forth in Article III or Article IV or in any
Ancillary Agreement, neither the Target Companies, Seller, nor any member,
officer, director, employee or agent of any of the foregoing, whether in an
individual, corporate or any other capacity, make any representation,
warranty, or other statement with respect to, and Buyer is not relying on,
such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness
of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or
plans), and Buyer agrees that it has not relied thereon. Section 11.18
Conflict Between Transaction Documents. The parties hereto agree and
acknowledge that to the extent any terms and provisions of this Agreement are
in any way 89 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt095.jpg) 

inconsistent with or in conflict with any term, condition or provision of any
other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby, this Agreement
will govern and control. Section 11.19 Specific Performance; Other Remedies.
(a) The parties hereto agree that the Target Companies, Seller and Buyer would
suffer irreparable damage prior to a termination in the event that the Closing
is not consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and that
money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any
such damages. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by Buyer, on the one
hand, or by Seller or the Target Companies, on the other hand, of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, Buyer, on the
one hand, and Seller and the Target Companies, on the other hand, will be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller and
the Target Companies, on the other hand, and to specifically enforce the terms
and provision of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of,
or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of Buyer, on the
one hand, and of Seller and the Target Companies, on the other hand, under
this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled
at Law or in equity, including the parties' right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII and to seek money damages. If, in order to obtain
such injunction or injunctions, monetary damages or other remedy, the non-
breaching party commences a legal proceeding that results in a judgment in
favor of such party, the other party will pay the non-breaching party's
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such legal
proceeding. Each party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by such party. Each
party hereby waives (i) any defenses in any action for specific performance,
including the defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate and (ii) any
requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite
to obtaining equitable relief. (b) If Seller or the Target Companies have been
granted an award of damages following the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Buyer agrees such damages may include
consequential, indirect, special or punitive damages, damages for the benefit
of the bargain lost by Seller and the Target Companies (taking into
consideration relevant matters, including the opportunities forgone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the time value of money), and diminution in value of the Target
Companies and the reimbursement of the Target Companies' and Seller's
reasonable and documented out- of-pocket costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees and expenses). Section 11.20 Consents. Buyer acknowledges that
certain consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
required from parties to Contracts, leases, licenses or other agreements to
which any Target Company is a party (including the consents under the
Contracts set forth on Schedule 4.05(a) and Schedule 4.15(b)) and such
consents have not been obtained. Prior to the Closing, to the extent requested
by Buyer, Seller and the Target Companies will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) give any notice to any Person and (b) obtain any
consent or waiver from any Person, in each case, that is required in
connection with the 90 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt096.jpg) 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller will provide Buyer a
reasonable opportunity to review any communications to be delivered pursuant
to this Section 11.20 and will reasonably cooperate with Buyer to incorporate
any comments proposed by Buyer with respect thereto. Buyer agrees and
acknowledges that Seller will have no Liability whatsoever to Buyer (and Buyer
will not be entitled to assert any claims) arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any consents under the Contracts set forth on Schedule
4.05(a) or Schedule 4.15(b) that may have been or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of
the default, acceleration or termination of any such Contract, lease, license
or other agreement as a result thereof. Buyer further agrees that no
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller or the Target
Companies contained herein will be breached or deemed breached and no
condition of Buyer will be deemed not to be satisfied as a result of the
failure to obtain any consents under the Contracts set forth on Schedule
4.05(a) or Schedule 4.15(b) or as a result of any such default, acceleration
or termination or any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation
commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any such consent or any such default,
acceleration or termination. Section 11.21 Electronic Delivery. This Agreement
and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent delivered by
means of a facsimile machine or electronic mail (any such delivery, an
"Electronic Delivery"), will be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and will be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof
delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto will re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto
or to any such agreement or instrument will raise the use of Electronic
Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic
Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent such defense related to
lack of authenticity. Section 11.22 Buyer Deliveries. Any document or item
will be deemed "delivered", "provided" or "made available" within the meaning
of this Agreement if such document or item was posted to the electronic
datasite with the project name "Virtual Lightning Room" maintained by Merrill
DatasiteOne in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(a) in the case of materials required to be made available on or prior to the
date hereof, on or before 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second
Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement or (b) in the case of
materials required to be made available on or prior to the Closing Date, on or
before 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day prior to the
Closing Date. Section 11.23 Guarantor. (a) Guarantor hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Seller the due, full and prompt
observance, performance, discharge, and payment by Buyer of all of Buyer's
obligations under this Agreement. This is an unconditional guarantee of
payment and not only of collection. Guarantor waives (i) promptness,
diligence, presentment, demand of performance, demand of payment, filing of
any claim, any right to require any proceeding first against Buyer, protest,
notice of any kind (including notices of acceptance hereof, dishonor, protest,
and of defaults hereunder), (ii) all demands whatsoever, (iii) all defenses
which may be 91 LEGAL02/39540989v11  

  

 ![](ex21tekratrientpurchagmt097.jpg) 

available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium, law, or other similar
law now or hereafter in effect, (iv) any right to require the marshalling of
the assets of Buyer or any other Person now or hereafter liable with respect
to Buyer's obligations hereunder or otherwise interested in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (v) all suretyship defenses generally in
connection with the performance of Buyer's obligations under this Agreement.
(b) Guarantor agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be released or
discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by: (i) the failure or
delay of Seller to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or
remedy against Buyer or any other Person now or hereafter liable with respect
to Buyer's obligations hereunder or otherwise interested in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) any change in the time, place, or manner
of payment or performance of any of Buyer's obligations hereunder or any
rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation, or other amendment or
modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement; (iii) the
addition, substitution, or release of any entity or other Person interested in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) any change in the
corporate existence, structure, or ownership of Buyer or any other Person now
or hereafter liable with respect to Buyer's obligations hereunder or otherwise
interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (v) any
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, or other similar proceeding affecting
Buyer or any other Person now or hereafter liable with respect to Buyer's
obligations hereunder or otherwise interested in the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (vi) the adequacy of any means Seller may have of obtaining
payment of Guarantor's obligations hereunder; (vii) the existence of any claim
(except in the case of finally determined claims), set- off or other right
that Guarantor may have at any time against Buyer or Seller, whether in
connection with any of Guarantor's obligations hereunder or otherwise; or
(viii) any other act or omission that may in any manner or to any extent vary
the risk of Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of Guarantor as a
matter of law or equity (other than as a result of payment or performance of
all of Guarantor's obligations hereunder in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement). (c) Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to Seller that: (i)
it has all requisite corporate or other power and authority to execute,
deliver, and perform this Agreement, the execution, delivery, and performance
of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action and do not
contravene any provision of Guarantor's organizational documents or any
applicable law, decree, order, judgment, or contractual restriction binding on
Guarantor or its assets, and this Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by such Guarantor; (ii) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid,
and binding obligation of Guarantor enforceable against Guarantor in
accordance with its terms, subject to (A) the effects of bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium, or other
similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and (B) general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); (iii) all
consents, approvals, authorizations, permits of, filings with, and
notifications to, any Governmental Body or any other Person necessary for the
due execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by it have been
obtained or made and all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and
no other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Body or
any other Person is required in connection with the execution, delivery, or
performance of this Agreement; and (iv) Guarantor has the financial capacity
to pay and perform all of its obligations under this Agreement, and all funds
necessary for Guarantor to 92 LEGAL02/39540989v11

fulfill such obligations shall be available to Guarantor for so long as its
obligations under this Section 11.23 shall remain in effect. (d) This Section
11.23 and Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall terminate upon the Closing
and the payment of all amounts required to be funded pursuant to Section 1.01
and Section 2.03. * * * * * 93 LEGAL02/39540989v11
