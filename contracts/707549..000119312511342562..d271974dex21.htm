v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 14, 2011 (this "
_Agreement_ "), among Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), BLMS Inc., a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Novellus Systems, Inc., a California
corporation (the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms used but not defined in
this Agreement have the meanings ascribed to them on  _Annex I_.

_RECITALS_

A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger (the "
_Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this
Agreement and the California Corporations Code (the " _CCC_ "), with the
Company to be the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ "), and each share of common stock, no par value, of the Company
(collectively, the " _Company Shares_ ") to be thereupon canceled and
converted into the right to receive a number of shares of the common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Shares_ "), on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

B. The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has (i)
determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, the
Company and its shareholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger (collectively, the " _Transactions_ "), and (iii) subject to the terms
set forth herein, resolved to recommend approval of the Merger and the
Agreement and the principal terms thereof by the Company shareholders;

C. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and
inducement to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company is entering into a
voting agreement with Parent in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Voting Agreement_ ");

D. The Board of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") has (i)
determined that the Merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, Parent
and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and
the Transactions, and (iii) subject to the terms set forth herein, resolved to
recommend that Parents stockholders approve the issuance of Parent Shares in
the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement;

E. The Board of Directors of Merger Sub has approved and declared advisable
this Agreement and the Merger; and

F. For United States federal income tax purposes, the parties intend that the
Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code
and that this Agreement will constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of the Code.

 

In consideration of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

 



   1. | THE MERGER 
---|--- 

1.1 The Merger. In accordance with the CCC, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
will be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will
continue as the Surviving Corporation.

1.2 Effective Time; Closing. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
will take place as promptly as practicable, but no later than two (2) business
days, following the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of the 

 



1  conditions set forth in _Article 6_ __( _Conditions to the Merger_ ) (other
than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), at
the offices of Jones Day, 1755 Embarcadero Road, Palo Alto, California, or
such other place agreed upon by the parties. The date upon which the Closing
occurs is herein referred to as the " _Closing Date_." On the Closing Date,
the parties will cause the Merger to be consummated by filing an agreement of
merger (the _"Agreement of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State
of California, in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance
with, the relevant provisions of the CCC (the date and time of such filing, or
such later time as agreed upon by Parent and the Company and specified in such
filing, being the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger will be as provided in the applicable provisions of the CCC. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.4 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws.

 

(a) The Articles of Incorporation of the Company will be amended at the
Effective Time to read in the form of _Exhibit B_ and, as so amended, such
Articles of Incorporation will be the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.

 

(b) The Bylaws of the Company will be amended at the Effective Time to read in
the form of _Exhibit C_ and, as so amended, such Bylaws will be the Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law.

1.5 Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation. The directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and, except
as determined by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time, the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

1.6 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the holders
of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") evidencing the
Company Shares or non-certificated shares of Company Shares represented by
book-entry on the records of the Company or the Companys transfer agent (the
" _Book-Entry Shares_ "):

(a) Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 1.6(b)_ and any Dissenting Company Shares) will be canceled and
converted automatically into the right to receive 1.125 (the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares (such aggregate amount as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_, the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
payable to the holder of such Company Share, in the manner provided in
_Section 1.9_ ( _Exchange of Company Shares; Stock Transfer Books_ ). All
Company Shares converted pursuant to this  _Section 1.6(a)_, when so
converted, will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled
and retired and will cease to exist. Each holder of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share will cease to have any rights with respect to such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share and the Company Shares, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and (x) the amount of all dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the date hereof and, on or prior to the
Effective Time, previously paid or payable on the date of surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and (y) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and prior to surrender or transfer and with a payment date
subsequent to surrender or transfer payable with respect to such securities.

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Company Shares or Parent Shares are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or

 



2  subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Exchange Ratio will be adjusted to the extent appropriate for all
purposes of this _Article 1_ ( _The Merger_ ).

(c) (i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional Parent Shares, or
book-entry credits of the same, will be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, (ii) no dividend or distribution of
Parent will relate to such fractional Parent Share interests, and (iii) such
fractional Parent Share interests will not entitle the holder thereof to
voting rights or any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. For purposes of
this _Section 1.6(c)_, all fractional Parent Shares to which a single holder
of Certificates of Book-Entry Shares would be entitled will be aggregated and
calculations will be rounded to the fourth decimal point. In lieu of the
issuance of fractional Parent Shares, the Exchange Agent will sell such
number of whole Parent Shares in the open market in order to pay each holder
of Company Shares entitled to receive a fractional Parent Share an amount in
cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the fractional Parent
Share to which such former holder (after taking into account all Company
Shares held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled
by (y) the Parent Stock Price. As soon as practicable after the determination
of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares formerly representing Company Shares with respect to any
fractional Parent Share interests, the Exchange Agent will make available such
amounts to such holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing Company Shares subject to and in accordance with the terms of
_Section 1.9(b)(i)_.

(d) Each Company Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be canceled and retired without any conversion thereof,
and no payment or distribution will be made and no consideration of any kind
will be delivered with respect thereto.

(e) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into and exchanged
for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

1.7 Company Stock Options; Company RSUs; Company PSUs; Company
Restricted Stock; 2011 Stock Incentive Plan.

(a) _Company Stock Options._ At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option
granted to a then-current employee of the Company and then outstanding,
whether vested or not, will be assumed by Parent and converted into an option
to purchase Parent Shares (each, an " _Assumed Stock Option_ ") in an amount
and at an exercise price as determined in accordance with this _Section
1.7(a)_. Each Assumed Stock Option will be subject to, and exercisable and
vested on, the same terms and conditions applicable to such Assumed Stock
Option (including under the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan, the
applicable stock option agreement and any other applicable Company Plan) as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each such Assumed Stock
Option will constitute an Assumed Stock Option (i) to acquire that number of
Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Company Shares subject to such
Assumed Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the
Exchange Ratio; and (ii) with an exercise price per Parent Share (rounded up
to the nearest whole penny) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x)
the exercise price per share of a Company Share subject to such Assumed Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio.
Promptly following the Closing Date, Parent will deliver to the holder of
each Assumed Stock Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption and
conversion. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the assumption by
Parent of Assumed Stock Options pursuant hereto satisfies the requirements of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.424-1 (to the extent Assumed Stock Options were
incentive stock options) and the provisions of this _Section 1.7(a)_ will be
interpreted and applied consistent with such intention. At the Effective Time,
each Company Stock Option granted to a then-former employee of the Company
that remains outstanding, whether vested or not, will, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, the holder of such
Company Stock Option or any other person terminate without payment of any
consideration therefor.

 



3 (b) _Company RSUs and Company PSUs._ At the Effective Time, each Company RSU
granted to a then-current employee of the Company and then outstanding,
whether vested or not, will be assumed by Parent and converted into the right
to receive the number of Parent Shares (each, an " _Assumed RSU_ ") as
determined in accordance with this _Section 1.7(b)_. Each Assumed RSU will be
subject to, and vested on, the same terms and conditions applicable to such
Assumed RSU (including under the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan,
the applicable restricted stock unit agreement and any other applicable
Company Plan) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each
Assumed RSU will constitute an Assumed RSU to acquire the number of
Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Company Shares subject to such
Assumed RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio. Promptly following the Closing Date, Parent will deliver to each
holder of an Assumed RSU a document evidencing the foregoing assumption and
conversion. Each Company PSU that vests in connection with the consummation of
the Merger will become fully vested with respect to the maximum number of
Company Shares payable pursuant to such Company PSU. At the Effective Time,
each Company RSU and each Company PSU granted to a then-former employee of the
Company that remains outstanding, whether vested or not, will, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, the
holder of such Company RSU or Company PSU or any other person terminate
without payment of any consideration therefor.

 

(c) _Form S-8 Registration._ As soon as practicable following the Closing Date
(but not later than five (5) business days after the Closing Date), Parent
will file an appropriate Registration Statement on Form S-8 with respect to
the offering of the Parent Shares issuable upon exercise of the Assumed Stock
Options and Assumed RSUs (the " _S-8 Registration Statement_ ") and will
maintain the effectiveness of the S-8 Registration Statement thereafter for so
long as any of such Assumed Stock Options or Assumed RSUs remain outstanding.

 

(d) _Company Restricted Stock._ Parent acknowledges that, in connection with
the consummation of the Merger, each Company Restricted Stock Award granted
to a director of the Company and that is then outstanding will become vested
and will be treated in the manner provided in _Section 1.6_ ( _Conversion of
Securities_ ).

 

(e) _Equity Plan Administrator._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board or any committee thereof that administers the Company Stock Plans will
adopt resolutions, in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
that (i) approve the transactions contemplated in this _Section 1.7_ as valid
under the terms of the Company Stock Plans and award agreements issued
thereunder and (ii) document that the treatment of unvested Company PSUs as
contemplated in _Section 1.7(b)_ is consistent with the terms of the
Companys applicable Company Stock Plans and the award agreements issued
thereunder. On the later of (x) the termination date of an individuals
employment or service, or (y) at least five (5) business days prior to the
Effective Time (or such longer period as may be required by the applicable
Company Stock Plan), the Company will provide written notice, in a form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, to each then-former employee of the
Company who holds outstanding Company Stock Options that are subject to 
_Section 1.7(a)_ regarding the treatment of such options pursuant to _Section
1.7(a)_ and of the individuals right to exercise any such vested options
prior to the Effective Time. Neither the Companys Board nor any committee
thereof that administers the Company Stock Plans will exercise its discretion
to accelerate the vesting of any outstanding, unvested Company Stock Options
or Company Equity Rights.

 

(f) _2011 Stock Incentive Plan._ Contingent upon and effective as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Companys 2011 Stock Incentive Plan.

1.8 Dissenters Rights.

 

(a) If the number of Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time equals or
exceeds five percent (5%) of the total number of Company Shares issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time (the " _Dissenting Threshold_ "), then
(i) no holder of any Dissenting Shares will be entitled to payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect of such Dissenting Shares, (ii) at the
Effective Time, all such Dissenting Shares will no longer be outstanding, will
be automatically cancelled, and will cease to exist, and (iii) except as 

 



4  otherwise provided by applicable Law, each holder of any such Dissenting
Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to the Dissenting Shares,
other than such rights as are granted by Chapter 13 of the CCC.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a holder of any
Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses
such holders rights under Chapter 13 of the CCC or a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to relief under
Chapter 13 of the CCC, then any such shares will be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and will have become the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in _Section 1.6(a)_ of this
Agreement, without any interest thereon.

 

(c) If the Dissenting Threshold is not met, any share that had previously been
a Dissenting Share will no longer be regarded as such and any such Dissenting
Shares will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and
will become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in
_Section 1.6(a)_ of this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

(d) The Company will give Parent (i) prompt notice of any Demand Notice
received by the Company, withdrawals thereof and any other instruments served
pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CCC and received by the Company, and (ii) the
Company will cooperate with Parent in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to the exercise of any rights of the holder of Dissenting Shares
under Chapter 13 of the CCC. The Company will not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by applicable Law, make any
payment with respect to any such exercise of any such rights of the holder of
Dissenting Shares under Chapter 13 of the CCC or offer to settle or settle any
such rights. The parties agree that they will not, and this Agreement does
not, confer or seek to confer upon any holder of Company Shares any
dissenters rights or appraisal rights greater than those provided by Chapter
13 of the CCC or otherwise expand or seek to expand the rights provided by
Chapter 13 of the CCC.

 

1.9 Exchange of Company Shares; Stock Transfer Books.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent._ Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a
bank or trust company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
the delivery of the Merger Consideration. Prior to or currently with the
Effective Time, Parent will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates sufficient
Parent Shares to make all deliveries of cash and Parent Shares as required by
_Section 1.6(a)_ and _Section 1.6(c)_. In addition, Parent will deposit, or
will cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions which
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 1.6_ ( _Conversion of Securities_ ). All such Parent
Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent, including any dividends or other
distributions that holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have the right
to receive pursuant to  _Section 1.6_ __( _Conversion of Securities_ ), is
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures._

(i) Promptly, and in any event within five (5) business days, after the
Effective Time, Parent will cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the
Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Shares entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_ a form of letter of
transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry Shares, as the case may be, pursuant to
such letter of transmittal. The form of letter of transmittal will be in
customary form and have such other provisions as reasonably agreed upon by
Parent and the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate or transfer of Book-Entry Shares, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of the Company Shares will
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) that number of Parent Shares
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_, and (y) a
check or wire transfer representing the aggregate amount of cash that such

 



5  holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_ and _Section
1.6(c)_, including cash payable in respect of any dividends or other
distributions that the holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
1.6_ __( _Conversion of Securities_ ). Each Certificate so surrendered will be
immediately canceled. The Exchange Agent will not accept guarantee of delivery
of a Certificate in lieu of actual delivery. No interest will accrue or be
paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate
for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate or the holder of any Book-
Entry Shares.

 

(ii) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares so transferred is registered on the stock transfer books of the Company
or the systems of The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ "), as the case may
be, it will be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered or
the Book-Entry Shares so transferred will be endorsed properly or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such payment will
have paid all transfer and other similar taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or Book-Entry Shares so transferred will
have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such
taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. The Merger Consideration
and any other dividends or distributions paid upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates or the Book-Entry Shares so transferred will be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Shares
previously represented by such Certificates or the Book-Entry Shares so
transferred.

(c) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent will invest all cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or (after the Effective Time) the
Surviving Corporation, and any and all interest earned on the funds will be
paid by the Exchange Agent to Parent or (after the Effective Time) the
Surviving Corporation. Parent will bear and pay all charges and expenses,
including those of Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with the payment of
funds to holders of Company Shares.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability._ At any time following the
twelfth (12th) month after the Effective Time, at the request of Parent,
Exchange Agent will deliver to Parent any portion of the Exchange Fund that
had been made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders
of Company Shares (including all interest and other income received by the
Exchange Agent in respect of the Exchange Fund), and, thereafter, such holders
will be entitled to look to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them or the due transfer of the Book-Entry Shares.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent will be liable to any holder of a Company Share for any
Merger Consideration or any other dividends or distributions delivered in
respect of such Company Share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Law.

(e) _Treatment of Shares after the Effective Time._ At the close of business
on the day of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will
be closed and thereafter there will be no further registration of transfers of
the Company Shares on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Shares except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.

 

(f) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable and customary amount as the Exchange Agent may require
as indemnity against Claims that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any other dividends or
distributions payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

 



6 1.10 Withholding Rights. Each of Merger Sub, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Exchange Agent is entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to _Article 1_ __( _The_ _Merger_ )
of this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares such amounts as are required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code and the Treasury Regulations, or any provision of state, local or
non-U. S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld,
and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of the Company Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 

1.11 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation determines or is advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company or (b) otherwise carry out the
provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its officers and directors will
be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of
attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in
Law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement, and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are
authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such
action.

(a) _Section 2.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all written

bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred

severance or other material benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all
U.S. employment Contracts to which the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
Company ERISA Affiliate is a party (except for agreements that provide for

Company or any Company Subsidiary annual base compensation less than $100,000
and that can be terminated without material cost or liability to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries), with respect to which the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any Company ERISA Affiliate has or could have any obligation or

current or former employee, officer or director of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any Company ERISA Affiliate (collectively, the " _Company Plans_
" and all Company Plans, excluding Company Plans not subject to U.S. Law, the
" _US Plans_ "). The Company has made available to Parent a true and complete
copy of each Company Plan and has made available to Parent a true and complete
copy of each material document, if any, prepared in connection with each such

or Company Equity Rights, in which case only forms of such agreements have
been made available to Parent, unless such individual agreements materially
differ from such forms), including as applicable (v) a copy of each trust or
other funding arrangement, (w) each most recent summary plan description and
summary of material modifications, (x) all annual reports on IRS Form 5500
filed within the past three (3) years, (y) the most recently received IRS
determination letter for each such Company Plan, and (z) the most recently
prepared actuarial report and financial statement in connection with each

(b) None of the Company Plans is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of
Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), a
"multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code)
(a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "), a "multiple employer welfare arrangement"
(within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA) a plan that is subject to Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or a "funded welfare plan" within the
meaning of Section 419 of the Code.

(c) Each Company Plan is operated in accordance with its terms and the
requirements of all applicable Laws including ERISA and the Code, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in material liability to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company and
the Company Subsidiaries have performed all obligations required to be
performed by them under and are not in default under or in violation of any
Company Plan, except for any such non-performance, default or violation that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in material liability to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of the date
hereof, no Action is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
in writing with respect to any Company Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits in the ordinary course of business) that would result in material
liability to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(d) Each US Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has timely received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS covering all of the provisions applicable to
such US Plan for which determination letters are currently available that such
US Plan is so qualified, has a remaining period of time under applicable
Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such letter
and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination, or
may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype or volume submitter plan, and
each trust established in connection with any US Plan that is intended to be
exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has
received a determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, has a
remaining period of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS
pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and to make any amendments
necessary to

 



12  obtain a favorable determination, or may rely upon an opinion letter for a
prototype or volume submitter plan, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
fact or event has occurred since the date of such determination letter or
letters from the IRS, if applicable, that could be expected to adversely
affect the qualified status of any such US Plan or the exempt status of any
such trust.

 

(e) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in material
liability to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
there has not been any material prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and not otherwise exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA) with respect to any US Plan. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in material liability to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, neither the Company nor any
Company ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under, arising out of or
by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for premiums to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary course of
business), including any liability in connection with (i) the termination
or reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA,
or (ii) the withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event exists that could give
rise to any such liability.

(f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in material
liability to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in conjunction with any
other event, such as termination of employment) will (i) result in any
material payment (including severance, unemployment compensation, parachute or
otherwise) becoming due to any director or employee of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary, any Company ERISA Affiliate or any of their respective
affiliates, or to any Governmental Authority or other person on behalf of any
such director or employee, from the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any
Company ERISA Affiliate or any of their respective affiliates under any
Company Plan, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under
any Company Plan, (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of any material
payment or vesting of any material benefits or (iv) result in the payment of
any amount that, individually or in combination with any other such payment,
would not be deductible pursuant to Code Section 280G (determined without
regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code) or Code Section 162(m).

 

(g) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in material
liability to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all
contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect to any US
Plan have been made on or before their due dates. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, result in material liability to the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all such contributions are or
were fully deductible for federal income tax purposes and no such deduction
has been challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Authority, and no fact
or event exists that could be expected to give rise to any such challenge or
disallowance.

(h) The term " _Company Foreign Plan_ " means any Company Plan that is
maintained outside of the United States. Except as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) the
Companys financial statements accurately reflect the Company Foreign Plan
liabilities and accruals for contributions required to be paid to the Company
Foreign Plans in accordance with applicable local accounting principles
consistently applied and (ii) all required contributions to all Company
Foreign Plans have been made as of the date hereof. None of the Company
Foreign Plans contains any provision that is reasonably likely to impose, in
connection with the Merger, any material liability on Parent. If, after
Effective Time, Parent determines that material liability exists as a result
of Company Foreign Plans, Parent shall have the option to convert Company
employees to plans with benefits no less favorable to those received by the
remainder of Companys employee base in each country.

2.11 Labor and Employment Matters. 

(a) As of the date hereof, there are no material Claims pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing between the Company or any
Company Subsidiary and any of their respective present or former employees.

 



13 (b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to
any collective bargaining agreement or similar labor union agreement with any

presently being negotiated. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the
employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is represented by any
labor union with respect to their employment with the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, and there are no activities or proceedings of any labor union to
organize any such employees. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no

any similar activity or dispute, affecting the Company or any Company

respects with all federal, state, and foreign Laws respecting employment and
employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, immigration,
workers compensation, long-term disability, occupational safety, plant
closings, compensation and benefits, and wages and hours (" _Employment
Practices_ "). Except as would not result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect, individually or in the aggregate, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is liable for any payment to any trust or other fund or to any
Governmental Authority, with respect to unemployment compensation benefits,
social security or other benefits or obligations for employees (other than
routine payments to be made in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice). To the Companys knowledge, as of the date hereof, (x)
there are no material audits or investigations pending or scheduled by any
Governmental Authority pertaining to the Employment Practices of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary; and (y) no material complaints relating to
Employment Practices of the Company or any Company Subsidiary have been filed
with any Governmental Authority or submitted in writing to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. To the Companys knowledge, no event has occurred, nor
does any condition or circumstance exist, that would reasonably be expected to
provide a basis for the commencement of any such labor strikes, slowdowns,
work stoppages, lockouts, or any similar activity or dispute. To the
Companys knowledge, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are not engaged,
and have never been engaged, in any unfair labor practice (as defined under
the National Labor Relations Act) and there is no charge or complaint against
the Company or any Company Subsidiary by the National Labor Relations Board,
any comparable state or foreign agency, or any individual, pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened.

 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 2.11(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no unwritten policies,
practices or customs or any other contracts, undertakings or agreements of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries that, by extension, could reasonably be
expected to entitle any current or former employee to benefits in addition to
what such employee is entitled by applicable legal requirements or under the
terms of such employees employment contract, except where such benefits,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Neither
the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is delinquent in payments to any of its
employees for any material wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses or other
direct compensation for any services performed for it or amounts required to
be reimbursed to such employees. Other than normal accruals of wages during
regular payroll cycles, there are no arrearages in the payment of wages except
for possible violations or arrearages, which are not, and will not reasonably
be expected to be, material in magnitude.

(e) To the knowledge of the Company, and except as would not result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect, individually or in the aggregate, no employee
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in any material respect in
violation of any term of any employment Contract, non-disclosure or

covenant to a former employer relating to the right of any such employee to be
employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary by which the individual is
employed because of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed
to be conducted by it or to the use of trade secrets or proprietary
information of others.

Effect, individually or in the aggregate, the Company and each Company
Subsidiary is in compliance with the Worker Readjustment and Notification Act

officials, or any other Governmental Authority.

Recommendation, Parent Change in Recommendation, Company Acquisition Proposal
or Parent Acquisition Proposal, as applicable. Nothing in this _Section
5.1(c)_ will limit the obligations of any party under _Section 5.1(a)_.

respectively, may also postpone or adjourn its meeting to permit both
meetings to occur on the same date. The Company will not postpone or adjourn
the Company Shareholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , nothing in this  _Section 5.1(d)_ will prevent the
Company from postponing or adjourning the Company Shareholders Meeting if (A)
there are holders of insufficient Company Shares present or represented by a
proxy at the Company Shareholders Meeting to constitute a quorum at the
Company Shareholders Meeting, (B) the Company is required to postpone or
adjourn the Company Shareholders

 



42  Meeting by applicable Law or Order or a request from the SEC or its staff,

adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting, including in order to (1) give
shareholders of the Company sufficient time to evaluate any information or
disclosure that the Company has sent to its shareholders or otherwise made
available to its shareholders by issuing a press release, filing materials
with the SEC or otherwise (including in connection with any Company Change in
Recommendation), or (2) to enable additional time to solicit proxies from
shareholders of the Company, or (D) Parent has postponed or adjourned the
Parent Stockholders Meeting. At the Company Shareholders Meeting, Parent and

Act), and adjournment of the Company Shareholders Meeting, as necessary, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes in favor of the

_Termination_ ), Parent will take all action reasonably necessary in
accordance with applicable Law or Order and Parents Charter Documents (i) to

other applicable Law to effect the Merger. Parent and the Company will
cooperate in good faith to jointly agree upon a date on which both the Company
Shareholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting will be held, it
being agreed that such date will be the same date for both meetings, and to
the extent that the Company postpones or adjourns its Company Shareholders
Meeting or Parent postpones or adjourns its Parent Stockholders Meeting, as
permitted by _Section 5.1(d)_ or _Section 5.1(e)_, Parent or the Company,
respectively, may also postpone or adjourn its meeting to permit both meetings
to occur on the same date. Parent will not postpone or adjourn the Parent
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , nothing in this _Section 5.1(e)_ will prevent Parent

are holders of insufficient Parent Shares present or represented by a proxy at

available to its stockholders by issuing a press release, filing materials
with the SEC or otherwise (including in connection with any Parent Change in
Recommendation), or (2) to enable additional time to solicit proxies
from stockholders of Parent, or (D) the Company has postponed or adjourned
the Company Shareholders Meeting. The issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger

Meeting unless otherwise approved in writing by the Company.

plants and other facilities, books and records of the Receiving Party, and

Partys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and will not
include the right to perform invasive testing. Without limiting the

Proposal, the Company may, subject to compliance with _Section 5.3(b)(v)_,

to make such Company Change in Recommendation would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board will
not be permitted to effect a Company Change in Recommendation pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(b)(ii)(A)_ with respect to or in connection with any

constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, (x) make a Company Change in
Recommendation if the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of the receipt of
such Company Superior Proposal, the failure to make such Company Change in
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to constitute a 

 



45  breach of its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under
applicable Law, and/or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ if the Company Board has concluded in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that, in light of

Recommendation; (x) the Company has, during such five (5) calendar day period,
if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to
amend this Agreement such that the Company Board no longer concludes that the
failure to make such Company Change in Recommendation pursuant to _Section
5.3(b)(ii)(A)_ would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under applicable Law; (y) the
Company Board determines, in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, after
reviewing any binding, written offer made by Parent during such five (5)

(5) calendar day period, the Company Board determines, in good faith,

any Company Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the
Company Board (a " _Designated Company Superior Proposal_ ") and attach the
most current form or draft of any written agreement providing for
the transaction contemplated by such Designated Company Superior Proposal (it

Company Amendment Notice, a three (3) calendar day period (such three (3) day
period, the " _Subsequent Matching Period_ "), as applicable, if requested by
Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement
in such a manner that the Company Acquisition Proposal that was determined to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal no longer is a Company Superior
Proposal; and

(C) at the end of such Initial Matching Period or Subsequent Matching Period,
as applicable, such Company Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and
the Company Board determines, in good faith, that such Company Acquisition
Proposal continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal (taking into

Designated Company Superior Proposal, as a result of the negotiations required
by  _Section 5.3(b)(iv)(B)_ or otherwise).

tender or exchange offer in such communication, and (ii) making any
disclosure to its shareholders that the Company Board has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to
make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its

at the end of such five (5) calendar day period, the Parent Board determines,
in good faith, that failure to make such Parent Change in Recommendation
pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)(ii)(A)_ would be reasonably likely to constitute
a breach of its fiduciary duties to Parents stockholders under applicable
Law.

(iv) Parent will not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Parent Change
in Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)(ii)(B)_ or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(i)_, and any purported termination
pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)(ii)(B)_ will be void and of no force or effect,
unless:

(A) Parent has provided to the Company prior written notice that it intends to
take such action and that the Initial Matching Period has commenced (a "
_Notice of Designated Parent Superior Proposal_ "), which notice will
describe the terms and conditions of any Parent Superior Proposal that is the
basis of the proposed action by the Parent Board (a " _Designated Parent
Superior Proposal_ ") and attach the most current form or draft of any
written agreement providing for the transaction contemplated by such
Designated Parent Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
subsequent amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of a
Parent Superior Proposal will require Parent to provide the Company a new
Notice of Designated Parent Superior Proposal (the " _Parent Amendment Notice_
"));

 

(B) Parent has during such Initial Matching Period or, as relates it to a
Parent Amendment Notice, the Subsequent Matching Period, as applicable, if
requested by the Company, engaged in good faith negotiations with the Company
to amend this Agreement in such a manner that Parent Acquisition Proposal that
was determined to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal no longer is a Parent
Superior Proposal; and

(C) at the end of such Initial Matching Period or Subsequent Matching Period,
as applicable, such Parent Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and the
Parent Board determines, in good faith, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal (taking into account
any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to or proposed in a
written, binding and irrevocable offer by the Company in response to a Notice
of Designated Parent Superior Proposal, as a result of the negotiations
required by  _Section 5.4(b)(iv)(B)_ or otherwise).

(v) Parent will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of
learning of the relevant information) advise the Company orally and in writing
of the receipt of any Parent Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of
the person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and
conditions of such Parent Acquisition Proposal (including any changes thereto)
and attaching a copy of any such written Parent Acquisition Proposal, or if
such Parent Acquisition Proposal is provided orally to Parent, Parent will
summarize in writing the terms and conditions of such Parent Acquisition
Proposal. Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed of the status and
material details (including any material change or proposed material change to
the terms thereof) of any Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent will provide
the Company with twenty-four (24) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior
notice as is provided to the members of the Parent Board) of any meeting of
the Parent Board at which the Parent Board is expected to consider any Parent
Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_  __( _No Parent Solicitation of
Transactions_ ) will prohibit Parent or the Parent Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e 2(a) under
the Exchange Act or making a statement required under Rule 14d 9 under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , that any such disclosure, other than a "stop, look
and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d 9(f) of the
Exchange Act, or any substantially similar communication, will be deemed to
be a Parent Change in Recommendation unless the Parent Board expressly
publicly reaffirms the

 



49  Parent Board Recommendation and rejects the applicable tender or exchange
offer in such communication, and (ii) making any disclosure to its
stockholders that the Parent Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary
duties to Parents stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_  that Parent
will not make any disclosure that would amount to a withdrawal, modification,
qualification or amendment of the Parent Board Recommendation other than
pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)_.

 

5.5 Employee Benefits Matters.

(a) From and after the Effective Time and until December 31, 2012, Parent (i)
will not reduce the base compensation or incentive compensation opportunities
of any Continuing Employee (provided that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary may
terminate any Continuing Employee during such period for any reason,
including, but not limited to, a termination without cause) and (ii) will
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain for the Continuing Employees each
Company Plan that is an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of and
subject to Section 3(3) of ERISA (other than the 401(k) Plan) pursuant to its
terms in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent
any such plan must be amended to comply with applicable Law. In the event that
the 401(k) Plan terminates prior to the Effective Time as contemplated in
Section 5.5(e), at the Effective Time each Continuing Employee who is on
United States payroll will be immediately eligible to participate in the
Parent Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(k) of the Code
(" _Parent 401(k) Plan_ "). Parent shall take all steps reasonably necessary
to permit each Continuing Employee who has received an eligible rollover
distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code), including any
rollovers of any outstanding loans from the 401(k) Plan, if any, to roll over
such eligible rollover distribution as part of any lump sum distribution to
the extent permitted by the 401(k) Plan into an account under the Parent
401(k) Plan.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time and until December 31, 2012, Parent
will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor in accordance with
its terms (as in effect on the date of this Agreement), the Novellus Systems,
Inc. Rule of 70 Accelerated Stock Vesting Retirement Plan; provided, further,
that the foregoing shall not be construed to impact any equity award
agreement that remains outstanding as of the date hereof and that includes
express contractual benefits under such plan.

(c) To the extent that any Continuing Employee becomes a participant in any US
Parent Plan after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, recognize all service of such Continuing Employee with the
Company or a Company Subsidiary, as the case may be, to the extent recognized
by the Company or a Company Subsidiary (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the extent
service with such predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such
Company Subsidiary) and reflected in the employment records of the Company or
such Company Subsidiary, for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for
accrual purposes, except for vacation and severance, if applicable) in any US
Parent Plan in which such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate
(in each case except to the extent such service credit would result in a
duplication of benefits in any such US Parent Plan).

(d) To the extent not prohibited by an insurer or service provider under a US
Parent Plan, Parent will waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitation, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods under any US Parent Plan in which the Continuing Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitation, exclusions, actively-at work requirements and waiting periods
would have been applicable under the comparable Company Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take such actions as Parent
may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to effect
such actions relating to the 401(k) Plan of the Company (the " _401(k) Plan_
") as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate, including amending and/or
terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms
of the 401(k) Plan and applicable Law and

 



50  provided that such action does not preclude the immediate participation of
the Continuing Employees in any successor plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent must make any such request in writing and within ten (10) business
days prior the Effective Time.

(f) This _Section 5.5_ will be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 5.5_,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.5_.

5.6 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, each person who is now or was prior to the
Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries and each person who is now or was prior to the Effective Time an
employee or director of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries who served as
a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries (within the meaning of and subject to Section
3(3) of ERISA) (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements), judgments, fines,
losses, Claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened Claim, action, suit, arbitration,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, in respect of, or arising out of, acts or omissions occurring,
or alleged to have occurred, at or prior to the Effective Time, based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, the fact that such
person is or was an officer or director of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, or a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit
plan of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent will, or
will cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, prior to the final disposition of any actual
or threatened Claim, action, suit, arbitration, proceeding or investigation
for which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement, promptly
following request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all costs, fees and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses) as
incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such Claim, action,
suit, arbitration, proceeding or investigation upon Parent or the Surviving
Corporations receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified
Person to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined by final judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified Person is not
entitled to be indemnified pursuant to this _Section 5.6(a)_. In the event
of any such action, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cooperate with
the Indemnified Person in the defense of any such action.

 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses), whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in favor of any
Indemnified Person as provided in the (i) Companys Articles
of Incorporation, (ii) the Companys Bylaws, (iii) the respective comparable
organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries, and (iv) any
indemnification or other agreements (clauses (i) through (iv), collectively,
the " _Indemnification Agreements_ ") of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (in the case of each such Indemnification Agreement, as in effect
on the date of this Agreement) will survive the Merger and will continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any Claims or potential
Claims against such directors, officers or employees arising out of such acts
or omissions (and until such later date as such Claims and any proceedings
arising therefrom are finally disposed of) or such later date as is provided
pursuant to the terms thereof, and from and after the Effective Time Parent
will comply with and honor, and will ensure that the Surviving Corporation
complies with and honors, the foregoing obligations. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify the Companys Articles of Incorporation, the Companys
Bylaws or the respective comparable organizational documents of the Company
Subsidiaries in any manner that could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such director, officer or employee with
respect to their acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time.

 



51 (c) For a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time,
Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide officers and
directors liability, fiduciary liability and similar insurance (collectively,
" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each Indemnified Person covered, as of the date of
this Agreement, by the Companys DandO Insurance policies on terms with respect
to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect
on the date of this Agreement, as well as covering Claims brought against each
Indemnified Person under ERISA; _provided_ , that, in satisfying its
obligations under this _Section 5.6(c)_, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last
full fiscal year, which amount the Company has disclosed to Parent prior to
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such maximum amount, Parent will be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding such maximum amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, the Company will have the right, in its sole
discretion, to purchase a "tail" directors and officers liability insurance
policy, covering the same persons and providing the same terms with respect
to coverage and amount as aforesaid, and that by its terms will provide
coverage until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, and upon the
purchase of such insurance, Parents and the Surviving Corporations
obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 5.6(c)_ will be
deemed satisfied.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section
5.6(d)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) will settle or otherwise
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any Claim or Action for which indemnification may
be sought by an Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such
settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional
release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such
Claim or Action and no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement
effected without his or her express written consent. Each Indemnified Party
will cooperate with Parent and the Surviving Corporation in the defense of any
such Action, will furnish or cause to be furnished records, documents,
information and testimony and will attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested by
Parent in connection therewith.

 

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will cause its successors and assigns to assume all of the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section
5.6_ ( _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_).

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section 5.6_  __(
_Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_) will survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Person and their respective heirs and legal representatives.
The rights provided for herein will not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which an Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law,
contract or otherwise.

 

5.7 Notification of Certain Matters.

(a) The Company will give prompt notice to Parent of (i) the Companys
becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by it in this
Agreement is untrue or inaccurate, if and only to the extent that such
untruth or inaccuracy would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ to fail to be satisfied at the
Closing, and (ii) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, if and
only to the extent that such failure would reasonably be expected to cause any
of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the

 



52  Merger set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_ to fail to be satisfied at the
Closing; _provided_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.7(a)_ will not limit, or otherwise affect, the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

(b) Parent will give prompt notice to the Company of (i) Parents becoming
aware that any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in this
Agreement is untrue or inaccurate, if and only to the extent that such untruth
or inaccuracy would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to
the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger set forth in _Section
6.3(a)_ to fail to be satisfied at the Closing, and (ii) any failure of Parent
or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, if and only to the extent that
such failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to
the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger set forth in _Section
6.3(b)_ to fail to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.7(b)_ will not limit, or otherwise
affect, the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

5.8 Litigation. In the event an Action related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby is brought, or threatened, by a Company
shareholder against the Company and/or any director of the Company, the
Company will have the right to control the defense of such litigation. Each
party will promptly notify the other party of any Action related to this
Agreement or the Transactions brought, or threatened, against it and/or any of
its directors and will provide the other party with updates and such
information as such other party will reasonably request with respect to the
status of the litigation and discussions between the parties to such Action
(unless the provision of such updates and information could reasonably be
expected to result in a loss of attorney-client privilege). The Company will
give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of and settlement
discussions with respect to such Action and will not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such Action
unless Parent will have consented in writing to such payment or settlement,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

5.9 Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, will take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and
do (or cause to be done), and assist and cooperate with the other party or
parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger, including: (i) using their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to the Merger set
forth in _Article 6_ __( _Conditions to the Merger_ ) to be satisfied; (ii)
using their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all actions or
nonactions, consents, waivers, approvals, orders and authorizations from
Governmental Authorities, give all notices to Governmental Authorities, and
make all registrations, declarations and filings with
Governmental Authorities, that are necessary to consummate the Merger; and
(iii) using their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
consents, waivers and approvals under any Company Material Contracts in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger so as to
maintain and preserve the benefits under such Company Material Contracts as of
the consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless otherwise
directed by Parent (which direction will not require payment to be made until
at or after the Effective Time), the Company will not be required to pay any
consent fee, "profit sharing" payment or other consideration (including
increased rent payments), or provide additional security (including a
guaranty) to any Third Party as a condition to receipt of any consent, waiver
or approval from any party to any such Company Material Contract. In addition
to the foregoing, neither Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the
Company, on the other hand, will take any action, or fail to take any action,
that is intended to, or has (or would reasonably be expected to have) the
effect of, preventing, impairing, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting
the consummation of the Merger or the ability of such party to fully perform
its obligations under this Agreement.

5.10 Antitrust Filings and Approvals.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, the parties will submit all merger notification filings, and all
other documents and information to be filed in connection

 



53  therewith, required under the HSR Act or the Antitrust Laws or merger
notification regulations of the jurisdictions identified in _Section 2.5_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Merger Notification Filings_ "). The
parties will submit all required Merger Notification Filings within thirty
(30) business days of the signing of this Agreement, and the Company and
Parent will each pay one-half of all applicable filing fees required in
connection with such Merger Notification Filings. Each of Parent and the
Company will:

(i) cooperate fully with each other and will furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of any Merger Notification
Filings;

(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to and comply with
any request for information regarding the Merger or Merger Notification
Filings from any Governmental Authority charged with enforcing, applying,
administering, or investigating any Antitrust Laws, including the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, any attorney general of any
state of the United States, or any other competition authority of any
jurisdiction (" _Antitrust Authority_ ");

 

(iii) keep the other party reasonably informed of any communication received
by such party from, or given by such party to, any Antitrust Authority
regarding the Merger, and any communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party regarding the Merger, in each case in a
manner that protects attorney-client or attorney work product privilege;

(iv) provide copies of any written communications received from or given to
any Antitrust Authority unless prohibited by applicable Law; and

(v) permit the other party to review and incorporate the other partys
reasonable comments in any communication given by it to any Antitrust
Authority or in connection with any proceeding by a private party related to
Antitrust Laws with any other person, in each case regarding the Merger and in
a manner that protects attorney-client or attorney work product privilege.

(b) Neither party will initiate, or participate in any meeting or discussion
with any Antitrust Authority with respect to any Merger Notification Filings,
applications, investigation, or other inquiry regarding the Merger without
giving the other party reasonable prior notice of the meeting or discussion
and, to the extent permitted by the relevant Antitrust Authority, the
opportunity to attend and participate (which, at the request of either party,
will be limited to outside antitrust counsel only); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that neither the Company nor Parent will engage in any substantive
communication with any Antitrust Authority with respect to any proposed action
specified in _Section 5.10(e)_ without the consent of the other
party. Subject to applicable Law and subject to all applicable privileges
(including the attorney client privilege), Parent and the Company will consult
and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to proceedings under
any Antitrust Law. Parent or the Company may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other party as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein will be given only to the outside legal counsel
of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written
permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials.

(c) Unless Parent and the Company agree otherwise and without limiting the
obligations stated in _Section 5.10(a)_ and _Section 5.10(b)_, Parent will
take any and all action necessary to (i) ensure (x) the prompt expiration of
any applicable waiting period under any Antitrust Laws and (y) clearance or
approval by any relevant Antitrust Authority, (ii) prevent the initiation of
any lawsuit by any Antitrust Authority or Governmental Authority under any
Antitrust Law, (iii) prevent the entry of any decree, decision, judgment,
ruling, preliminary or permanent injunction, or any Order, Law, rule,
regulation or other action that would enjoin or prohibit the consummation of
Merger or make it unlawful, or (iv) ensure that no Antitrust Authority with
the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the
Merger, fails to do so by the Outside Date.

 



54 (d) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub and any of their respective affiliates
will not take any action with the intention to or that could reasonably be
expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or any necessary
approval of any Antitrust Authority under any Antitrust Law, or the expiration
of the required waiting period under any Antitrust Law. In addition, Parent
and Merger Sub will not, and will not permit their respective subsidiaries to,
acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business, person or division
thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or
otherwise), if such acquisition, would reasonably be expected to materially
increase the risk of not obtaining any applicable clearance, consent, approval
or waiver under Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to (i) license, divest,
dispose of or hold separate any assets or businesses of Parent or the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or otherwise take or commit to take
any action that limits in any manner its freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, any of the assets or businesses of Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (ii) agree to or effect
any license, divestiture, disposition or hold separate any business or take
any other action or agree to any limitation that is not conditioned on the
consummation of the Merger. The Company (x) will not take or agree to take any
action identified in clause (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence
without the prior written consent of Parent and (y) if so requested by Parent,
will use reasonable best efforts to effect any license, divestiture,
disposition or hold separate of any of the Companys assets or businesses
necessary to obtain clearances or approvals required for the Closing under the
Antitrust Laws, provided that such action is conditioned on the consummation
of the Merger.

 

5.11 Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, (i) Parent will take such
actions as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by _Section
1.7_ __( _Company Stock Options; Company RSUs; Company PSUs; Company
Restricted Stock_ ) with respect to the assumption and conversion of any
Company Stock Options, Company Equity Rights or other convertible securities
by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) the Company will
take such actions as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated
by _Section 1.7_ __( _Company Stock Options; Company RSUs; Company PSUs;
Company Restricted Stock_ ), and any other dispositions of equity securities
(including derivative securities) of the Company by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to (i) delist the
Company Shares from the NASDAQ and (ii) to terminate the registration of the
Company Shares under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that such delisting or
termination will not be effective until after the Effective Time.

5.13 Further Assurances. Each party hereto, at the reasonable request of
another party hereto, will execute and deliver such other instruments and do
and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary or desirable for
effecting the consummation of this Agreement and the Transactions.

5.14 Public Announcements. No press release or public announcement, statement
or disclosure concerning the Merger will be issued by either party without the
prior consent of the other party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by Law or Order, including the rules or regulations of any U.S. or
non-U.S. securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement will use its reasonable efforts to allow the other
party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance; _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 5.14 ___( _Public Announcements_ ) will not apply to any press
release or public announcement, statement or disclosure made or proposed to be
made by (a) the Company pursuant to _Section 5.3(b)_ or _Section 5.3(c)_,
or (b) Parent pursuant to _Section 5.4(b)_ or _Section 5.4(c)_.

5.15 Transfer Taxes. Parent will pay all transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration, value added and other similar Taxes and fees incurred in
connection with the Transactions, other than any such Taxes and fees imposed
on holders of Company Shares as a result of the Transactions.

(a) The Company and, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation,
will comply with all of its obligations and duties under the terms of the

the obligations of the Company under the Senior Convertible Notes, any coupons
appertaining thereto and the Indenture.

 

5.17 Qualification as a Reorganization. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company
will not take or cause to be taken any action that would cause the Merger to
fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. Each of Parent and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Tax opinions described in _Section 6.2(e) _and _Section 6.3(e)_
and similar Tax opinions dated the effective date of the Registration
Statement. Officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will use reasonable
best efforts to deliver to Jones Day, counsel to Parent, and Morrison and
Foerster LLP, counsel to the Company, customary representation letters of
Parent, Merger Sub and Company for purposes of such Tax opinions, at such time
or times as may be reasonably requested by such law firms, including
the effective date of the Registration Statement and the Closing Date, except
that neither Parent nor the Company will be obligated to deliver such letters
if the proposed statements and representations set forth therein are not true,
correct and complete in all material respects at such time.

such expenses, whether or not any Transaction is consummated.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its
affiliates, that neither the Company Fee nor the Parent Fee is a penalty, but
rather, in the circumstances in which the Company Fee or Parent Fee is
payable, each is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, respectively, for the efforts
and resources expended and opportunity forgone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. Each party acknowledges and hereby agrees that
the provisions of this _Section 7.3_ __( _Fees_ ) are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without such provisions, neither party would have
entered into this Agreement. Each party acknowledges and hereby agrees that
nothing in this _Section 7.3_ __( _Fees_ ) prevents either party from seeking
additional remedies in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the other
party.
