sale and conveyance of the Assets to Buyer is Buyers payment to Sellers of
the aggregate sum of $775,000,000 (the " _Purchase Price_ "), as adjusted in

At the Closing, fifty percent (50%) of the Deposit shall be paid to the
Sellers as part of the Purchase Price and, subject to Section 11.03
and Section 14.07, from and after the Closing Date until the later of (x) the

remain in the Escrow Account to partially support any indemnification
obligations of the Sellers.

Section 2.03 _Allocated Values_. The Purchase Price is allocated among the

Article III

Title Matters

Section 3.01 _Examination Period_. Following the Execution Date until 5:00

possession of either Seller, subject to such restrictions on disclosure as
may exist under confidentiality agreements or other agreements binding on
either Seller or such data; provided, however, that the Sellers will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to develop an alternative method to produce
such information to Buyer in circumstances where such restrictions on
disclosure exist.

 



5 Section 3.02 _Defensible Title and Permitted Encumbrances_. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Defensible Title_ " means, with respect to a
Lease or Well included in the Assets, such ownership by Sellers in such Lease
or Well that except for and subject to Permitted Encumbrances:

 

(a) for Wells, entitles Sellers to receive not less than the percentage set
forth in _Exhibit B_ as Sellers " _Net Revenue Interest_ " of all
Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from the presently producing
formation, all without reduction, suspension or termination of such interest
throughout the productive life of such Well, except for carried interests,
production payments, reversionary interests or other changes in interest in
time as specifically set forth in _Exhibit B_ ;

 

(b) for Wells, obligates Sellers to bear no greater than the percentage set
forth in _Exhibit B_ as Sellers " _Working Interest_ " of the costs and

changes in interest in time as specifically set forth in _Exhibit B_ ;

 

(c) for Leases, entitles Sellers to receive not less than the percentage set
forth in _Exhibit A_ as Sellers " _Net Revenue Interest_ " of all

(f) is free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and defects in title.

 

(g) The term " _Permitted Encumbrances_ " shall mean any of the following
matters to the extent the same are valid and subsisting and affect the
Assets:

(i) the Leases and Contracts; provided, that the terms and conditions
thereof do not, individually or in the aggregate, operate to detract from the
value of or interfere with the use or ownership of the Assets subject thereto
or affected thereby;

 

(ii) any (A) undetermined or inchoate liens or charges constituting or
securing the payment of expenses that were incurred incidental to the
maintenance, development, production or operation of the Assets or for the
purpose of developing, producing or processing Hydrocarbons therefrom or
therein, and (B) materialmans, mechanics, repairmans, employees,

individually or in the aggregate, detract from the value of or interfere with
the use or ownership of the Assets subject thereto or affected thereby;

(v) lessors royalties, overriding royalties, carried interests, reversionary
interests and similar burdens on or deductions from the proceeds of production
created or in existence as of the Effective Time, whether recorded or
unrecorded; provided, that such matters do not operate to, individually or in
the aggregate (A) reduce the Net Revenue Interests or Net Acres of any of the
Assets to less than the Net Revenue Interest or Net Acres set forth in
_Exhibit A_ or _Exhibit B_ , as applicable, or (B) increase Sellers Working
Interest above that shown in _Exhibit B_ without a corresponding increase in
Net Revenue Interest;

 

(vi) required Third Party (as defined in Section 1.02 above) (A) consents or
(B) notices; provided, that such consents to assignments or similar
agreements with respect to which waivers or consents are obtained from the
appropriate parties for the transactions contemplated hereby or required
notices have been given or such required notices have been given for the
transactions contemplated hereby to the holders of such rights and the
appropriate period for asserting such rights has expired without an exercise

in Section 4.02(b)) to control or regulate any of the Assets and the
applicable laws, rules, and regulations of such Governmental Authorities; and

 

(ix) any other defects and irregularities affecting the Assets which
individually or in the aggregate do not (A) reduce the Net Revenue Interests
or Net Acres of any of the Assets to less than the Net Revenue Interest or Net
Acres set forth in _Exhibit A_ or _Exhibit B_ , as applicable, (B) increase
Sellers Working Interest above that shown in Exhibit B without a
corresponding increase in Net Revenue Interest, or (C) individually or in the
aggregate, detract from the value of or interfere with the use or ownership of
the Assets subject thereto or affected thereby.

 



7 Section 3.03 _Title Defect_.

 

(a) The term " _Title Defect_ ," as used in this Agreement, shall mean: (i)
any encumbrance, encroachment or irregularity affecting, defect in or
objection to Sellers ownership of any Asset that causes Sellers not to have
Defensible Title to such Asset; or (ii) any default by either Seller under a
Lease, farmout agreement or other contract or agreement that would (A) have a
material adverse effect on the operation, value or use of such Asset, or (B)
prevent either Seller from receiving the proceeds of production attributable
to such Sellers interest therein.

 

(b) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event
shall any of the following constitute a Title Defect: (i) defects based
solely on an assertion that either of Sellers files lack information
(including title opinions); (ii) defects in the chain of title consisting of
the failure to recite marital status in a document or omissions of successors
of heirship or probate proceedings, unless Buyer provides a reasonable basis
for the assertion that such failure or omission has resulted or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Third Partys actual and superior claim
of title to the affected Asset; (iii) defects arising out of lack of survey;
and (iv) defects arising out of lack of corporate or other entity
authorization unless Buyer provides a reasonable basis for the assertion that
the action was not authorized and that such lack of authorization has
resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in a Third Partys
actual and superior claim of title to the affected Asset.

 

Section 3.04 _Notice of Title Defects_.

 

(a) If Buyer discovers any Title Defect affecting any Asset, Buyer shall
notify Panther reasonably promptly, but no later than the expiration of the
Examination Period, of such alleged Title Defect. To be effective, such notice
must (i) be in writing, (ii) be received by Panther prior to the expiration of
the Examination Period, (iii) describe the Title Defect in reasonable detail,
(iv) identify the specific Asset or Assets affected by such Title Defect, and
(v) include the value of such Title Defect as determined by Buyer (such
notice, a " _Notice of Defective Interests_ "). Except as provided in the
Warranty Deed and without limiting Buyers rights under Article XIV, any
matters that may otherwise constitute Title Defects, but of which Panther has
not been specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing,
shall be deemed to have been waived by Buyer for all purposes and shall
constitute Permitted Encumbrances.

(b) Upon the receipt of a Notice of Defective Interests from Buyer, Panther
and Buyer shall attempt to mutually agree on a resolution with respect to any
alleged Title Defect. Panther on behalf of both Sellers shall have the option,
but not the obligation at the sole cost of Sellers, to attempt to cure or
remove any such Title Defect prior to the Closing. In the event that Panther
does not elect to cure or remove any alleged Title Defect or the Title Defect
is not cured and Buyer and Panther are not able to

 



8  mutually agree upon the resolution of such alleged Title Defect within ten
Business Days after the last day of the Examination Period, then the alleged
Title Defect shall be subject to the Purchase Price adjustment provisions set
forth in Section 3.05. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Business Day_ "
means any day other than (i) a Saturday, Sunday or a federal holiday, or (ii)
a day on which commercial banks in Houston, Texas are authorized or required
to be closed.

(c) Unless Panther and Buyer agree otherwise, the value attributable to each
Title Defect (the " _Title Defect Value_ ") that is asserted by Buyer in the
Title Defect notices shall be determined based upon the criteria set forth
below, without duplication: (i) If the Title Defect is a lien upon any Asset,
the Title Defect Value is the amount necessary to be paid to remove the lien
from the affected Asset.

 

(ii) If the Title Defect affecting a Lease causes the actual Net Acres covered
by such Lease to be less than the Net Acres set forth on _Exhibit A_ for such
Lease, then the Title Defect Value shall be an amount equal to such difference
in such Net Acres multiplied by the Per Net Mineral Acre Price as determined
from the Allocated Value for such Lease.

 

(iii) If the Title Defect is that the Net Revenue Interest for a Lease is less
than the Net Revenue Interest for such Lease as set forth on _Exhibit A_ ,
then the Title Defect Value shall be an amount equal to the Allocated Value
for such Lease multiplied by the difference of (A) 1 _minus_ (B) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the actual Net Revenue Interest of such Lease and
the denominator of which is Net Revenue Interest for such Lease as set forth
on _Exhibit A_. By way of example, in the event the Allocated Value of a Lease
is $100,000, the actual Net Revenue Interest for such Lease is 74% and the
Net Revenue Interest for such Lease set forth in _Exhibit A_ is 75%, the
applicable Title Defect Value for such Lease would be calculated as follows:
$100,000 x (1  74/75) = $1,333.

 

(iv) If the Title Defect is that the Net Revenue Interest for a Well is less
than the Net Revenue Interest for such Well as set forth on _Exhibit B_ ,
then the Title Defect Value shall be an amount equal to the Allocated Value
for such Well multiplied by the difference of (A) 1 _minus_ (B) a fraction,
the numerator of which is the actual Net Revenue Interest of such Well and
the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest for such Well as set
forth on _Exhibit B_. By way of example, in the event the Allocated Value of a
Well is $100,000, the actual Net Revenue Interest for such Well is 74% and
the Net Revenue Interest for such Well set forth in _Exhibit B_ is 75%, the
applicable Title Defect Value for such Well would be calculated as follows:
$100,000 x (1  74/75) = $1,333.

 

(v) If a Title Defect is of a type not described in clauses "(ii)," "(iii),"
or "(iv)" above, the Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking into
account the Allocated Value of the Well or Lease, the portion of the Well or
Lease adversely affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title
Defect, the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of
the Well or Lease, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

 



9 (vi) If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge upon the affected Asset (including any increase in Working Interest
for which there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue Interest),
other than as described in Sections 3.04(c)(i) and (ii) for which the economic
detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the amount of the Title Defect Value
shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the affected
Asset, the portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect
of the Title Defect, the potential discounted economic effect of the Title
Defect over the life of the affected Asset, and the Title Defect Value placed
upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Sellers.

 

(vii) The Title Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined without
duplication of any costs or losses included in another Title Defect Value
hereunder.

(viii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall a
Title Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value of the Lease, Well or other
Asset affected thereby.

Section 3.05 _Remedies for Title Defects_.

 

(a) With respect to each Title Defect that is not cured on or before the
Closing and for which Panther and Buyer are in agreement with respect to the
existence of the Title Defect and the Title Defect Value, the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Title Defect Value agreed upon in
writing by Panther and Buyer.

 

(b) If any Title Defect is in the nature of an unobtained Required Consent to
assignment or other restriction on assignability, the provisions of Section
3.07 shall apply.

(c) If on or before the Closing Panther and Buyer have not agreed upon the
validity of any asserted Title Defect or have not agreed on the Title Defect
Value attributable thereto, then either such Party shall have the right to
elect to have the validity of such Title Defect and/or such Title Defect Value
determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to Section 16.03. If the
validity of any asserted Title Defect or the Title Defect Value attributable
thereto is not determined before the Closing, the amount of the Title Defect
Value related thereto as set forth in the Notice of Defective Interests shall
be paid by Buyer at Closing to the Escrow Agent, and any such amount (and any
interest earned thereon) shall be paid to Buyer or Sellers, as applicable,
upon the final resolution of such dispute.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if the
Title Defect Value of a given individual Title Defect does not exceed
$100,000, then no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made for such
Title Defect, (ii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price
determined in accordance with this Agreement for all Title Defects
(exceeding $100,000) does not exceed 2% of the Purchase Price prior to any
adjustments thereto, then no adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made
therefor,

 



10  and (iii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in
accordance with this Agreement for all Title Defects (exceeding $100,000) does
exceed 2% of the Purchase Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then the
Purchase Price shall only be adjusted by the amount of such excess.

Section 3.06 _Special Warranty of Title_. Each Seller shall, severally and
not jointly, agree to warrant and defend title to the Assets solely unto Buyer
against every Person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any
part thereof, by, through or under such Seller, but not otherwise; subject,
however, to Permitted Encumbrances.

Section 3.07 _Preferential Rights and Consents to Assignment_. Sellers
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not require the
payment of any consideration) to obtain all Required Consents (as defined in
Section 5.10) prior to the Closing and deliver any notices required in
connection with preferential rights to purchase the Assets, and Buyer shall
reasonably assist Sellers with such efforts. Without limiting the foregoing,
Sellers shall promptly, but in any event, no later than five days after the
Execution Date provide the holders of consents and preferential rights with
notice of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and request their
consent to assign and/or waiver of their preferential right to purchase. To
the extent any Required Consent is not obtained prior to the Closing or
notices required in connection with preferential rights to purchase the Assets
are not delivered, then (x) such failure shall constitute a Title Defect as to
that portion of the Assets affected thereby, (y) the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the Title Defect Value with respect thereto and
(z) the affected Assets will not be included in the sale. Following the
Closing, Sellers shall continue to use their commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any Required Consent not otherwise obtained prior to the Closing
and if any such unobtained Required Consent is subsequently obtained within 90
days after the Closing Date, then Sellers shall notify Buyer and an additional
Closing shall be held within five Business Days following receipt of such
Required Consent at which (i) Sellers shall sell, assign and convey the
affected Assets to Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (using the
form of Assignment) and (ii) Buyer shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to
the Allocated Value of such Assets, adjusted in accordance with this
Agreement. In the event of such assignment, the term "Closing Date" with
respect to any such Assets shall mean the date of assignment of such Assets
from Sellers to Buyer.

Section 3.08 _Remedies for Title Benefits_.

 

(a) Sellers shall be entitled to an upward adjustment to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 10.02(a)(i) with respect to all Title Benefits (such
upward adjustment not to exceed the aggregate amount of all reductions to the
Purchase Price due to Title Defects), in an amount mutually agreed upon by the
Parties. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Title Benefit_ " shall
mean Sellers Net Revenue Interest in any Lease or Well that is greater than
or in addition to that set forth in _Exhibit A_ or _Exhibit B_ , as
applicable, or Sellers Working Interest in any Well that is less than the
Working Interest set forth in _Exhibit B_ (without a corresponding decrease in
the Net Revenue Interest) or, Sellers Net Acres in any Lease is greater than
the Net Acres on _Exhibit A_ for such Lease. Any matters that may otherwise
constitute Title Benefits, but of which Buyer has not been specifically
notified by Sellers in accordance with the foregoing, shall be deemed to have
been waived by Sellers for all purposes.

 



11 (b) If with respect to a Title Benefit the Parties are not deemed to have
agreed on the amount of the upward Purchase Price adjustment or have not
otherwise agreed on such amount on or before two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Sellers or Buyer shall have the right to elect to have such
Purchase Price adjustment determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to
Section 16.03. If the amount of such adjustment is not determined pursuant to
this Agreement before the Closing, the disputed portion of the Purchase Price
with respect to the Asset affected by such Title Benefit shall be paid by
Buyer at Closing to the Escrow Agent, and any such amount (and any interest
earned thereon) shall be paid to Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, upon the
final determination of the Purchase Price adjustment, if any, with respect to
such Title Benefit.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if the
value of a given individual Title Benefit does not exceed $100,000, then no
adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made for such Title Benefit, (ii) if
the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with
this Agreement for all Title Benefits (exceeding $100,000) does not exceed 2%
of the Purchase Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then no adjustment of
the Purchase Price shall be made therefor, and (iii) if the aggregate
adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement
for all Title Benefits (exceeding $100,000) does exceed 2% of the Purchase
Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then the Purchase Price shall only be
adjusted by the amount of such excess.

 

Article IV

 

Environmental Matters

Section 4.01  _Environmental Review_.

(a) Buyer shall have the right to conduct or cause a consultant (" _Buyer
s Environmental Consultant_") to conduct an environmental review of the
Assets prior to the expiration of the Examination Period (" _Buyer s
Environmental Review_"). The cost and expense of Buyers Environmental
Review, if any, shall be borne solely by Buyer. The scope of work comprising
Buyers Environmental Review may include a Phase I environmental site
assessment, but shall not include any sampling, intrusive test or procedure
with respect to any Asset without the prior consent of Panther. Buyer shall
(and shall cause Buyers Environmental Consultant to): (i) consult with
Panther before conducting any work comprising Buyers Environmental Review,
(ii) perform all such work in a safe and workmanlike manner and so as to not
unreasonably interfere with Panthers operations, and (iii) comply with all
applicable laws, rules, and regulations of applicable Governmental
Authorities. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable
efforts (which shall not require the payment of any consideration) to obtain
any Third Party consents that are required in order to perform any work
comprising Buyers Environmental Review. Panther shall have the right to have
a representative or representatives accompany Buyer and Buyers Environmental
Consultant at all times during Buyers Environmental Review. With respect to
any

 



12  samples taken in connection with Buyers Environmental Review, Buyer shall
take split samples, providing one of each such sample, properly labeled and
identified, to Panther. Buyer hereby agrees to release, defend, indemnify and
hold harmless Sellers from and against all claims, losses, damages, costs,
expenses, causes of action and judgments of any kind or character (INCLUDING
THOSE RESULTING FROM EITHER SELLERS SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY) arising out of or relating to any actions by
Buyer or Buyers Environmental Consultant during Buyers Environmental Review.

 

(b) During the period from the Execution Date until the date that is 12 months
following the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "), unless otherwise
required by applicable law, Buyer shall (and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause Buyers Environmental Consultant to) treat confidentially any
matters revealed by Buyers Environmental Review and any reports or data
generated from such review (the " _Environmental Information_ "), and Buyer
shall not (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Buyers
Environmental Consultant to not) disclose any Environmental Information to
any Governmental Authority or other Third Party without the prior written
consent of Sellers, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Unless
otherwise required by law, during the Restricted Period Buyer may use the
Environmental Information only in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If Buyer, Buyers Environmental Consultant, or
any Third Party to whom Buyer has provided any Environmental Information
becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the Environmental Information
during the Restricted Period, Buyer shall provide Panther with prompt notice
sufficiently prior to any such disclosure so as to allow Sellers to file
any protective order or seek any other remedy (at Sellers expense), as it
deems appropriate under the circumstances. At the request of Panther, during
the Restricted Period Buyer shall provide copies of the Environmental
Information to Sellers without charge as soon as practicable after Buyer
receives the Environmental Information. If this Agreement is terminated prior
to the Closing, (i) at the request of Panther, Buyer shall deliver any
Environmental Information to Sellers that has not been previously delivered
to Panther and (ii) all of the Environmental Information delivered to Panther
shall become the sole property of Sellers.

 

Section 4.02 _Environmental Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the
terms set forth below shall have the following meanings.

 

(a) " _Environmental Defect_ " shall mean, with respect to any given Asset, an
individual environmental condition that (i) constitutes a material violation

warranty contained herein, or (ii) a breach by the other Party of any of the
covenants or agreements in this Agreement; provided that (x) such breach
(under either clause (i) or (ii)) if uncured prior to the Closing would

terminating Party is not then itself in material breach of any provision of
this Agreement and (z) such breach has not been cured within 30 days following

cured within such time period;

 

provided, however, that no Party shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to clause (b) or (c) above if such Party is at such
time in material breach of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 11.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that the Closing does not
occur as a result of any Party exercising its right to terminate pursuant to
Section 11.01, then except as set forth in Section 11.03, this Agreement shall
be null and void and no Party shall have any further rights or obligations
under this Agreement, except Buyers indemnity and confidentiality
obligations contained in Section 4.01, Buyers obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 17.04) and Sections 11.02,
17.03 and 17.11 shall continue pursuant to their terms; provided, however,
that a termination of this Agreement shall not relieve any Party from any
liability for Losses (as defined in Section 14.03) incurred as a result of an
actual or intentional fraud with respect to the making of any representation
or warranty in this Agreement ("Fraud") or material breach by such Party of
its representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations
hereunder occurring prior to such termination.

Section 11.03 _Termination Damages_.

 

(a) If Sellers exercise their option to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 11.01(h) or Section 11.01(i), Sellers shall be entitled to retain the
Deposit, as liquidated damages (" _Sellers  Damage Amount_"), on account of
Buyers failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement and consummate
the Closing. Buyer and Sellers acknowledge and agree that (i) Sellers actual
damages upon the event of such a termination are difficult to ascertain with
any certainty, (ii) Sellers Damage Amount is a reasonable estimate of such
actual damages and (iii) such liquidated damages do not constitute a penalty.

 



29 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject
in all respects to Section 11.04 and the proviso in this sentence, (i) an
order of specific performance or other equitable relief in accordance with
Section 11.04 and (ii) the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this Article XI and if, as and when required pursuant to this Section 11.03,
receipt and payment of the Sellers Damage Amount, if applicable, together
with the payment of any amounts due pursuant to Section 11.05, shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Sellers and their Affiliates suffered as a
result of the failure of the Closing to be consummated or for a breach or
failure by Buyer to perform hereunder or otherwise, in either case that
resulted in failure of the Closing to be consummated and upon payment of the
Sellers Damage Amount, if applicable, and payment of any amounts payable
pursuant to Section 11.05, if applicable, none of the Buyer or its Affiliates
shall have any further liability or obligation to the Sellers or their
Affiliates relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (and the abandonment or termination hereof or
thereof); provided, that nothing herein shall impair the rights and remedies
of the Sellers with respect to (i) those provisions that survive termination
in accordance with Section 11.02, (ii) Fraud or material breach by the Buyer
of its representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations hereunder occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.01 and (iii) Article XIV. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Sellers may simultaneously or at different times pursue specific
performance pursuant to Section 11.04 and the Sellers Damage Amount, if
applicable; provided, that in no event shall Sellers be entitled to both (x)
payment of the Sellers Damage Amount, if applicable, and (y) specific
performance pursuant to Section 11.04 which results in the consummation of
the Closing.

Section 11.04 _Specific Performance_. Each Party hereby agrees that if the
other Party violates or threatens to violate any of the provisions of this
Agreement, it would be difficult to determine the entire cost, damages or
injuries which such Party and its Affiliates would sustain. Furthermore, each
Party acknowledges that if it violates or threatens to violate any of the
provisions of this Agreement, the other Party may have no adequate remedy at
law. In that event, each Party shall have the right, in addition to any other
rights that may be available to it, to obtain in any court of competent
jurisdiction injunctive relief to restrain any violation or threatened
violation by the other Party of any provision of this Agreement or to compel
specific performance by the other Party of one or more of their obligations
under this Agreement (and any requirements for posting of bonds or other
security for injunction or other equitable remedy are hereby expressly
waived). Each Party hereby agrees not to raise any objections to
the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to enforce
compliance with the covenants and agreements of each Party under this
Agreement. No Party shall be required to provide any bond or other security,
or to show irreparable harm, in connection with seeking an injunction or other
equitable remedy to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement. The Parties hereto further agree that by seeking the remedies
provided for in this Section 11.04, including by the institution of a court
proceeding, no Party shall in any respect waive its right to seek any other
form of relief that may also be available to it under this Agreement in the
event that the remedies provided for in this Section 11.04 are not available
or otherwise are not granted. Nothing set forth in this paragraph shall
require a Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit such Partys right
to institute a proceeding for) specific performance prior or as a condition
to exercising any termination right under Section 11.01, nor shall the
commencement of any proceeding pursuant to this Section 11.04 restrict or
limit such Partys right to subsequently terminate this Agreement in
accordance with this Section 11.01 if

 



30 specific performance is not provided for any reason or if such Party
dismisses, withdraws or terminates such proceeding. The obtaining (but not
the seeking) by a Party of specific performance shall foreclose the right of
such Party to obtain a money judgment or any other remedy available at law or
in equity against the other Party for any damage that may result from the
violation of the Agreement for which the right of specific performance arose.

Section 11.05 _Attorneys  Fees, Etc_. If any Party to this Agreement resorts
to legal proceedings to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing Party in such
proceedings shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred by such Party,
including reasonable attorneys fees, in addition to any other relief to
which such Party may be entitled.

Article XII

 

Post Closing Obligations

 

Section 12.01 _Allocation of Expense and Revenues_.

 

(a) Provided that the Closing occurs, appropriate adjustments shall be made
between Buyer and Sellers so that (i) Buyer will receive all proceeds from
sales of Hydrocarbons that are produced and saved from and after the Effective
Time and any other revenues arising out of the ownership or operation of the
Assets from and after the Effective Time, net of all applicable production,
severance, and similar taxes, and Buyer shall be responsible for all costs and
expenses that are incurred in the ownership or operation of the Assets from
and after the Effective Time, including, without limitation, all drilling
costs, all capital expenditures, all overhead charges under applicable
operating or other agreements (regardless of whether a Seller or an Affiliate
of a Seller serves as operator prior to the Closing), and (ii) Sellers will
receive all proceeds from sales of Hydrocarbons that are produced and saved
prior to the Effective Time and any other revenues arising out of the
ownership or operation of the Assets prior to the Effective Time, net of all
applicable production, severance, and similar taxes, and Sellers shall be
responsible for all costs and expenses that are incurred in the ownership or
operation of the Assets prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) In addition to but without duplication of the foregoing, Sellers will be
paid (i) the amount as of the Effective Time of all prepaid Asset Taxes and
any prepaid costs, including rentals and insurance premiums attributable to
the Assets, insofar as such prepaid costs relate to periods of time after the
Effective Time (as determined in the case of Asset Taxes pursuant to Section
9.03), and (ii) the value of all merchantable Hydrocarbons produced prior to
the Effective Time but in storage above the inlet connection or upstream of
the applicable sales meter on the Closing Date.

 

(c) In addition to but without duplication of the foregoing, Buyer will be
paid (i) an amount equal to all unpaid Asset Taxes that are attributable to
periods of time prior to the Effective Time (as determined pursuant to Section
9.03), which amounts shall, to the extent not actually assessed, be computed
based on such Asset Taxes for the preceding taxable period (such amount to be
determined pursuant to Section 9.03 for the period of Sellers and Buyers
ownership before, at and after the Effective Time), and (ii) an amount equal
to all cash in, or attributable to, suspense accounts relative to the Assets
for which Buyer has assumed responsibility under Section 14.02.

 



31 (d) In addition to the foregoing, appropriate adjustments shall be made
between Buyer and Sellers so that any production or pipeline imbalances
attributable to the Assets, if any, with respect to periods prior to the
Effective Time are borne solely by Sellers and any such imbalances, if any,
with respect to periods on and after the Effective Time are borne solely by
Buyer.

(e) All Tax credits (including Tax credits for horizontal wells)
applicable to the Assets for periods prior to the Effective Time shall be
allocated to and for the benefit of Sellers, provided that such credits shall
be given at such time as taken by Buyer and granted by the taxing authorities.
All Tax rebates and refunds applicable to the Assets for periods prior to the
Effective Time shall be allocated to and for the benefit of Sellers, provided
that such rebates or refunds are actually received by Buyer.

 

(f) All amounts due under this Section 12.01 will be settled initially at
Closing and finally accordance with Final Accounting Statement under Section
12.02; provided, however, to the extent Buyer takes a Tax credit or receives a
Tax refund or rebate to which Sellers are entitled pursuant to Section
12.01(e) after the Final Accounting Statement is settled, Buyer shall
promptly make a payment to Sellers in the amount of such Tax credit, refund or
rebate.

Section 12.02 _Final Accounting Statement_.

(a) On or before 90 days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a post-closing statement setting forth a detailed
calculation of all post-Closing adjustments applicable to the period between
the Effective Time and the Closing (the " _Accounting Statement_ "). The
Accounting Statement shall include any adjustment or payment which was not
finally determined as of the Closing Date and the allocation of revenues and
expenses as determined in accordance with Section 12.01. To the extent
reasonably required by Sellers, Buyer shall assist in the preparation of the
Accounting Statement. Sellers shall provide Buyer such data and information as
Buyer may reasonably request supporting the amounts reflected on the
Accounting Statement in order to permit Buyer to perform or cause to be
performed an audit. The Accounting Statement shall become final and binding
upon the Parties on the 30th day following receipt thereof by Buyer unless
Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_
") to Sellers prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
detail the dollar amount, nature and basis of any disagreement so asserted. If
a Notice of Disagreement is received by Sellers in a timely manner, then the
Parties shall resolve the Dispute (as defined in Section 16.01) evidenced by
the Notice of Disagreement in accordance with Article XVI.

(b) Within five Business Days after the Final Accounting Statement becomes
final, Sellers shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to Sellers in immediately
available funds the net amount due. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Final Accounting Statement_ " shall mean (i) the Accounting Statement sent
by Sellers to Buyer unless

 



32  Buyer gives a Notice of Disagreement in accordance with Section 12.02(a), or
(ii) upon resolution of any Dispute contained in such Notice of Disagreement,
the revised Accounting Statement reflecting such resolution, which the
Parties shall issue, or cause the Independent Expert to issue.

Section 12.03 _Further Cooperation_.

(a) Sellers shall deliver electronic Records within one Business Day after
Closing and shall make the physical Records available to be picked up by
Buyer at the offices of Panther during normal business hours within five
Business Days after the Closing to the extent the Records are in the
possession of Sellers and are not subject to contractual restrictions on
transferability; provided, however, that the Sellers will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer (which shall not
require the payment of any consideration or undertaking of any extraordinary
obligation) to develop an alternative method to produce such information to
Buyer in circumstances where such restrictions on disclosure exist. Sellers
shall have the right to retain copies of any of the Records and the rights
granted under Section 17.05. 

(b) After the Closing Date, each Party, at the request of the other and
without additional consideration, shall take such actions and shall execute
and deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, from time to time
such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and shall take such other
action as the other Party may reasonably request to convey and deliver the
Assets to Buyer and to accomplish the orderly transfer of the Assets to Buyer
in the manner contemplated by this Agreement. After the Closing, the Parties
will cooperate to have all proceeds received attributable to the Assets be
paid to the proper Party hereunder and to have all expenditures to be made
with respect to the Assets be made by the proper Party hereunder.

 

Article XIII

Operation of the Assets

Section 13.01 _Operations after Effective Time_. Panther agrees, from and
after the Execution Date until the Closing, except as expressly contemplated
by this Agreement or as expressly consented to in writing by Buyer, that it
shall operate as a reasonable and prudent operator in compliance with all
laws, the terms and conditions of the Leases and contracts, and otherwise in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and consistent
with the capital plan as set forth on _Schedule 13.01_ (the " _Capital Plan_
"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and except as otherwise
expressly required by this Agreement or the Capital Plan, during the period
from the Execution Date to the Closing, Panther shall:

 

(a) not propose or commit to any new operation reasonably anticipated to
require future capital expenditures in excess of $250,000 net to the Sellers
Working Interest or ownership interest in the affected Asset or make or commit
to make any other capital expenditure (or series of related capital
expenditures) in excess of $250,000 net to Sellers Working Interest or
ownership interest in the affected Asset;

 



33 (b) maintain the books of account and records relating to the Assets in
the usual, regular and ordinary manner, in accordance with its usual

Interests;

 

(g) maintain all material Permits, bonds and guaranties, and make all filings
that are required to be made under applicable law;

(h) not transfer, sell, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any
Assets, individually or in the aggregate, with a replacement cost in excess
of $100,000, except for sales and dispositions of Hydrocarbons and obsolete
equipment made to any Person that is not Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;

(i) participate in any operation or activity proposed with respect to any
Asset which could result in any Asset becoming subject to a penalty or
forfeiture as a result of an election not to so participate (except if
participating in such operation or activity would result in a breach of clause
(a), Sellers have provided Buyer with notice of such operation or activity
and Buyer has not provided Seller with notice to proceed with such operation
or activity);

 

(j) not grant or create any preferential right or other similar transfer
restriction with respect to any Asset;

 

(k) not plug or abandon any Well located on the properties included in the
Assets without Buyers prior written consent unless required to do so by an
applicable law, authorized regulatory agency or court; and

(l) not commit to, authorize, propose or enter into an agreement if the
performance thereof would result in breach of any of the foregoing.

In order to reimburse Panther for administrative overhead expenses incurred
in order to operate the properties included in the Assets in accordance with
this Section 13.01 from the Effective Time to the Closing Date, Buyer shall
pay Panther a fee of $1,000 per month for each Well operated, prorated for
any partial month.

Buyers approval of any action restricted by this Section 13.01 shall be
considered granted within five Business Days (unless a shorter time is
reasonably required by the circumstances and such shorter time is specified in
Sellers notice) after Sellers notice to Buyer in accordance with this
Section 13.01 requesting such consent unless Buyer notifies Sellers to the
contrary during such five Business Day period or such shorter time, as
applicable. In the event of an emergency with respect to injury to life,
property or the environment, Sellers may take such action in violation of this
Section 13.01 as a prudent operator would take and that is necessary to
mitigate the effects of such emergency or terminate such emergency and shall
notify Buyer of such action promptly thereafter.

Section 13.02 _Limitations on the Operational Obligations and Liabilities
of Seller_.

(a) From and after the Execution Date and until the Closing, and subject to
the provisions of applicable operating and other agreements, Panther shall
use its reasonable efforts to operate the Assets and use its reasonable
efforts to cause any other operators to operate and administer the Assets in a
manner consistent with its past practices, and shall carry on its business
with respect to the Assets in substantially the same manner as before
execution of this Agreement.

 

(b) Buyer acknowledges that Panther owns undivided interests in some or all of
the Assets, and Buyer agrees that the acts or omissions of the other working
interest owners shall not constitute a violation of the provisions of this
Article XIII, nor shall any action required by a vote of working interest
owners constitute such a violation so long as Panther has voted its interests
in a manner that complies with the provisions of this Article XIII. To the
extent that Panther is not the operator of any of the Assets, the

 



35  obligations of Panther in this Article XIII shall be construed to require
that Panther use reasonable efforts (without being obligated to incur any
expense or institute any cause of action) to cause the operator of such
Assets to take such actions or render such performance within the constraints
of the applicable operating agreements and other applicable agreements.

 

Section 13.03 _Operation of the Assets After the Closing_. It is expressly
understood and agreed that Panther shall not be obligated to
continue operating any of the Assets following the Closing and Buyer hereby
assumes full responsibility for operating (or causing the operation of) all
Assets following the Closing. Panther shall make its personnel available to
Buyer prior to the Closing as may be reasonably necessary to assist in the
transition if Buyer becomes the operator. Without implying any obligation on
Panthers part to continue operating any Assets after the Closing, if Panther
elects to continue to operate any Assets following the Closing at the request
of Buyer, due to constraints of applicable joint operating agreement(s),
failure of a successor operator to take over operations or other reasonable
cause, such continued operation by Panther shall be for the account of Buyer,
at the sole risk, cost and expense of Buyer. Panther, as a part of the Assumed
Obligations, is hereby released and indemnified by Buyer from all claims,
losses, damages, costs, expenses, causes of action and judgments of any
kind or character (INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM PANTHERS SOLE, JOINT,
COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY) with respect to (a)
such continued operations by Panther, (b) Buyers assumption of
operations from Panther, and (c) compliance with the terms of any applicable
joint operating agreement related to the election of a successor operator.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, concurrent with
Closing, Panther will resign as operator of any Wells within the Assets that
Panther currently operates.

Section 13.04 _Casualty Loss_.

 

(a) If after the Execution Date and prior to the Closing Date (i) any part of
the Assets shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or if any
part of the Assets shall be taken in condemnation or under the right of
eminent domain or if proceedings for such purposes shall be pending or
threatened, and the Casualty Value of such individual casualty or taking is
2% of the Purchase Price or less or (ii) any downhole Subject Interest
regardless of the amount of loss is destroyed or otherwise impaired by
casualty (other than by blowout), this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect notwithstanding any such destruction, taking or proceeding, or the
threat thereof and the Parties shall proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such destruction and Buyer
shall accept as compensation all sums paid to Sellers by Third Parties by
reason of such casualty or taking, including any sums paid pursuant to any
policy or agreement of insurance or indemnity, and Sellers shall assign,
transfer and set over unto Buyer all of the rights, title and interest of
Sellers in and to any claims, causes of action, unpaid proceeds or other
payments from Third Parties, including any policy or agreement of insurance or
indemnity, arising out of such casualty.

 



36 (b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion
of the Subject Interests (i) is destroyed or otherwise impaired by casualty
(other than downhole destruction or impairment through downhole risks other
than blowouts) or (ii) is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent
domain, and the Casualty Value of such individual casualty or taking exceeds
2% of the Purchase Price, the Parties shall proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (x) in the case of a Subject Interest taken
by condemnation or right of eminent domain, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Casualty Value of such Subject Interest or (y) in the case of a
Subject Interest being destroyed or otherwise impaired by casualty (other than
downhole destruction or impairment through downhole risks other than
blowouts), Sellers may elect prior to Closing either (A) to cause the Subject
Interests affected by any Casualty to be repaired or restored, at Sellers
sole cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which work may extend after
the Closing Date) or (B) to pay to Buyer all sums paid to such Seller by third
Persons by reason of the casualty, including any sums paid pursuant to any
policy or agreement of insurance or indemnity, and Sellers shall
assign, transfer and set over unto Buyer all of the rights, title and
interest of Sellers in and to any claims, causes of action, unpaid proceeds or
other payments from Third Parties, including any policy or agreement of
insurance or indemnity, arising out of such casualty.

(c) The term " _Casualty Value_ " shall mean (i) as to any Subject Interests
taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain, the Allocated Value
of such Subject Interest, and (ii) as to any Subject Interests destroyed or
otherwise impaired by casualty, the amount of the costs and expenses
associated with repairing or restoring the Subject Interests affected by such
casualty, and, in the case of clause "(ii)," such Casualty Value shall be
determined before the Closing by Buyer and Sellers in good faith, or if Buyer
and Sellers are not able to agree on such amount, by an independent firm with
experience involving the performance of services of the type necessary to
repair or restore the Subject Interests affected by such casualty on oil and
gas properties reasonably acceptable to Sellers and Buyer. The determination
of the Casualty Value shall be determined based on and giving due
consideration of, and shall not exceed, the Allocated Value of the Subject
Interest to which such casualty relates.

 

(d) As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the earlier of (i)
three Business Days after Sellers receives notice of a casualty or (ii)
Closing, Sellers shall inform Buyer of such casualty.

Section 13.05 _Operatorship_. Concurrent with Closing, Panther will send out
notifications of its resignation as operator and nomination of Buyer as
successor operator for all Wells Panther currently operates and is selling to
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. Sellers make no representation
and/or warranty to Buyer as to the transferability or assignability of
operatorship of such Wells. Buyer acknowledges that the rights and obligations
associated with such Wells are governed by applicable agreements and that
operatorship will be determined by the terms of those agreements.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, except with respect
to those Retained Obligations for which notice is given pursuant to Section
14.05(a), all Retained Obligations shall be deemed to be Assumed Obligations
on the date on which the Retention Period ends.

 

Section 14.03 _Buyer s Indemnification_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall
hold harmless and indemnify each Seller, its managers, officers, directors,
employees, agents, partners, representatives, members, Affiliates,
subsidiaries, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_
") from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse each Seller
Indemnitee for, any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, causes of

Section 14.05 _Limits on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Other than any such indemnification obligation under Section 14.04(d),
Sellers indemnification obligation under Section 14.04 shall only apply if

14.07 claiming indemnification within twelve (12) months of the Closing.

 

(b) No Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to make any claim for
indemnification under Section 14.04(b) or Section 14.04(c) with respect to
Section 13.01 in respect of any Individual Matter unless such claim is for
Losses in an amount in excess of $250,000. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Individual Matter_ " means any indemnification claim or series of

(c) If the total amount of all Losses that Buyer Indemnitees have the right
to assert against Sellers under Section 14.04(b) or Section 14.04(c) with
respect to Section 13.01 (" _Buyer Losses_ ") does not exceed 3% of
the Purchase Price (the " _Basket_ "), then Sellers shall have no obligation
under Section 14.04(b) or Section 14.04(c) with respect to Section 13.01 with
respect to any such Losses. If the total amount of all Buyer Losses exceeds
the Basket, then Sellers obligations under Section 14.04(b) and/or Section

the aggregate amount of all Buyer Losses exceeds the amount of the Basket.

PAID TO A THIRD PARTY PURSUANT TO A CLAIM FOR WHICH A PARTY IS
SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED OR
CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR
STRICT LIABILITY OF THE OTHER PARTY OR PARTIES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING,
THIS SECTION 14.05(e) SHALL NOT RESTRICT A BUYER INDEMNITEES ABILITY TO
RECOVER ACTUAL, DIRECT DAMAGES FROM THE SELLERS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDING
FOR DIMINUTION IN VALUE OF AN ASSET.

 



39 Section 14.06 _Exclusive Remedies with Respect to Representations and
Warranties_. Except in the case of Fraud, the rights and remedies of the
Parties under this Article XIV are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other
rights and remedies which any Party may have under this Agreement or otherwise
against any other Party with respect to the transactions contemplated herein
for monetary relief with respect to any breach of any representation or
warranty. This Section 14.06 shall in no way limit the rights or remedies
available to any Party with respect to the breach of any agreement or
covenant of any other Party contained herein, including any equitable remedy
available to such Party.

Section 14.07 _Notices and Defense of Indemnified Matters_.

(a) Each Party claiming it is entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "
_Indemnitee_ ") shall promptly notify the Party or Parties from which it is
seeking indemnification (the " _Indemnitor_ ") of any matter of which it
becomes aware and for which it is entitled to indemnification under
this Agreement (a " _Claims Notice_ "). Each Claims Notice shall: (i) state
that such Indemnitee believes in good faith that such Indemnitee is or may be
entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Article XIV
or is or may otherwise be entitled to a monetary remedy; (ii) contain a brief
description of the facts and circumstances supporting such Indemnitees claim;
and (iii) if practicable, contain a good faith, non-binding, preliminary
estimate of the aggregate amount of the actual and potential Losses that the
Indemnitee believes have arisen and may arise as a result of such facts and
circumstances (the aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may be modified by
such Indemnitee from time to time, being referred to as the " _Claimed
Amount_ "). The Indemnitor shall respond (a " _Claim Response_ ") to the
Claims Notice during the 20 day period commencing upon delivery by an
Indemnitee of a Claims Notice. If in the Claim Response the Indemnitor agrees
that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee or that part, but not
all of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee (such partial amount, the
" _Agreed Amount_ "), such amount shall be paid to the Indemnitee in
accordance with Section 14.07(c). If in the Claim Response, the Indemnitor
does not agree that the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee or that only
an Agreed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee
shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the contested
amount within 30 days after the date on which the Indemnitor delivers a Claim
Response (or such longer period as the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor may
mutually agree in writing). If the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor resolve such
dispute during such period, then their resolution of such dispute shall be
binding on the Parties and a settlement agreement stipulating the amount owed
to the Indemnitee (the " _Stipulated Amount_ ") shall be signed by the
Indemnitee and the Indemnitor. Following execution of the settlement
agreement, the Stipulated Amount shall be paid to the Indemnitee in accordance
with Section 14.07(c). If the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee are unable to
resolve their dispute at the end of such 30-day period (or such longer period
as the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor may mutually agree in writing) such
dispute shall be submitted to the Independent Expert for resolution pursuant
to Section 16.03. Upon the resolution of such dispute by the Independent
Expert, any amounts owing to the Indemnitee shall be paid in accordance with
Section 14.07(c).

 



40 (b) On the date that is 12 months from the Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers
shall issue a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to release to the Sellers the amount remaining in the Escrow
Account as of such date, less the aggregate Claimed Amounts set forth in any
Claims Notices that have been asserted, but not resolved prior to such date.
Upon the final resolution of all such Claims Notices pursuant to this
Agreement, Buyer and Sellers shall issue a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to the Sellers the
amount remaining in the Escrow Account.

(c) Any indemnification of the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to this Article
XIV shall be delivered by Buyer to Panther by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Panther within five days after the
determination thereof. Any indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant
to this Article XIV shall be delivered to Buyer from the Escrow Account in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer within five days
of determination thereof. Subject to Section 14.05, if the funds remaining in
the Escrow Account are insufficient to cover the full amount owing to a Buyer
Indemnitee pursuant to this Article XIV, then Sellers shall pay the amount of
such shortfall to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Buyer within five days of determination thereof.

 

(d)

 

(i) In order for an Indemnitee to be entitled to any indemnification provided
for under this Article XIV in respect of a claim or demand made by any non-
Affiliated Person against the Indemnitee (a "T _hird-Party Claim_ "), such
Indemnitee must provide a Claims Notice to the Indemnitor with respect to such
the Third-Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after receipt, but
in no event later than ten Business Days after receipt by such Indemnitee of
notice of the Third-Party Claim; provided, that failure to give such
notification on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnitee
shall deliver to the Indemnitor, within five Business Days after the
Indemnitees receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including
court papers) received by the Indemnitee relating to the Third-Party Claim.

(ii) Within 30 days after receipt of a Claims Notice regarding a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnitor may, at such Indemnitors option and expense,
participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnitor and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee; provided, however, that the Indemnitor may not
assume and conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim if a material part of
such Third-Party Claim (x) seeks an injunction or other equitable relief
(other than equitable claims that are ancillary to claims for monetary damages
which are the primary relief sought) or (y) is asserted directly by, or on
behalf of, a Person that has 

 



41  a business relationship with the Indemnitee or, if the Indemnitee is a Buyer
Indemnitee, relates to the Assets purchased hereunder. Should an Indemnitor so
elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not
be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the employment of
such counsel has been specifically authorized by the Indemnitor for such
Third-Party Claims, (ii) the Indemnitor fails to diligently prosecute the
defense of such Third-Party Claim or (iii) in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to the Indemnitee, there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnitee and the Indemnitor that cannot be waived. If the Indemnitor assumes
the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense (subject to the immediately preceding sentence), separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being understood, however, that the
Indemnitor shall control such defense. If the Indemnitor chooses to defend any
Third-Party Claim, all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of such Third-Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnitors reasonable request) the provision to the
Indemnitor of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such
Third-Party Claim (provided, that the Indemnitor enters into customary
confidentiality arrangements with the Indemnitee regarding such records and
information), and making employees and other representatives and advisors
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the Indemnitor shall
control the defense of any Third-Party Claim then the Indemnitor shall be
entitled to settle such Third-Party Claim; provided, that, the Indemnitor
shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any
settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a
result of such settlement or cessation, (A) injunctive or other equitable
relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee, (B) such settlement does not
expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from all liabilities and
obligations with respect to such claim, without prejudice, (C) such Indemnitee
shall have to pay a portion of the settlement or (D) such settlement affects
Buyers interest going forward.

and in making the decision to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
transaction contemplated hereby, Buyer has relied solely on the basis of its
own independent due diligence investigation of the Assets and upon the
representations and warranties made in Article V, and not on any other
representations or warranties of Sellers or any other Person.

fully performed in accordance with their terms. Representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements shall terminate at the expiration of their respective

land, title and division of interest files; contracts; _engineering_ and Well
files; and books and records related to the operation of the Assets prior to
the Closing Date. Buyer shall retain and preserve the Documents for a period
of no less than seven (7) years following the Closing Date (or for such
longer period as may be required by law or governmental regulation), and shall
allow either Seller or its representatives to inspect the Documents at
reasonable times and upon reasonable notice during regular business hours
during such time period. Sellers shall have the right during such period to
make copies of the Documents at its expense.

 

Section 17.06 _Sellers  Consent_. Whenever Sellers consent or election is
required under this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise, the
consent or election of Panther will be sufficient to bind the Sellers.

Section 17.07 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the documents to be executed hereunder, and the exhibits and
schedules attached hereto constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or
written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof. No
supplement, amendment, alteration, modification or waiver of this Agreement
shall be binding unless executed in writing by the Parties and specifically
referencing this Agreement.

Section 17.08 _Waiver_. All waivers of any of the provisions of this Agreement
to be effective shall be in writing. No waiver of any of the provisions of
this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other
provision hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a
continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided.

Section 17.09 _Publicity_. Each Party shall not (and shall cause its
Affiliates not to) make any press release or other public announcement
regarding the existence of this Agreement, the contents hereof or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the
other Parties; provided, however, that the foregoing shall in no way
restrict the following: (i) any disclosure of the existence of this Agreement
and the related transactions by a Party pursuant to a press release or other
public announcement to the extent that the other Parties are not identified in
such disclosure; (ii) disclosure to the extent necessary for a Party to
perform this Agreement (including disclosures to Governmental Authorities or
Third Parties holding preferential rights to purchase, rights of consent or
other rights that may be applicable to the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, as reasonably necessary to provide notices, seek waivers,
amendments or termination of such rights, or seek such consents); (iii)
disclosure to the extent required (upon 

 



46  advice of counsel) by applicable securities or other laws or regulations or
the applicable rules of any stock exchange having jurisdiction over the
Parties or their respective Affiliates; or (iv) disclosure to the extent,
subject to this Section 17.09, such Party has given the other Party a
reasonable opportunity to review such disclosure prior to its release and no
objection is raised; and provided, further, that, in the case of the
foregoing clauses "(ii)" and "(iii)," each Party shall use its reasonable
efforts to consult with the other Party regarding the contents of any such
release or announcement prior to making such release or
announcement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after Closing, any Party may
disclose high-level summary financial information regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in industry conference presentations or similar
disclosures to potential or actual limited investors.

Section 17.10 _Construction_. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. The Parties
acknowledge that they have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and as such the Parties agree that if an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises hereunder, this
Agreement shall not be construed more strictly against one Party than another
on the grounds of authorship.

 

Section 17.11 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Sections
14.03 and 14.04, nothing in this Agreement shall provide any benefit to any
Third Party or entitle any Third Party to any claim, cause of action, remedy
or right of any kind, it being the intent of the Parties that this Agreement
shall otherwise not be construed as a Third Party beneficiary contract.

 

Section 17.12 _Assignment_. Except as provided in Section 9.04, no Party may
assign or delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder without the prior
written consent of the other Parties and any assignment made without such
consent shall be void. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors, assigns and legal representatives.

Section 17.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, other documents delivered
pursuant hereto and the legal relations between the Parties shall be governed
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, without
giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws that would result in the
application of the laws of another jurisdiction, except that, to the extent
that a dispute arises with respect to a portion of land located in a state
other than Texas, the law of such other state shall apply as to that portion
of land located in (or otherwise subject to the laws of) such other state.
The Parties agree to venue in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, including, without
limitation, with respect to any arbitration conducted pursuant to Article XVI.
