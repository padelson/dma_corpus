Common Shareholders (excluding Seller and Purchaser) will have the following
options in connection with the exchange of their Seller Common Stock in
connection with the Parent Merger: __

 

 __(i) AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER, all of such holder s Seller Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be converted into and become the
Stock Consideration (such election, the " _All Stock Election_ "), provided
that fractional shares will not be issued and cash (payable by check) will be
paid in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03; or _ _

__(ii) AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER, all of such holder s Seller Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be converted into and become the Cash
Consideration (such election, the " _All Cash Election_ "); or __

__(iii) AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER, such holder s aggregate number of
shares of Seller Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be
converted into and become any combination of the Stock Consideration and the
Cash Consideration (such election, the " _Mixed Election_ "); or __

__(iv) IF NO ELECTION IS MADE BY THE HOLDER BY THE ELECTION DEADLINE (AS
DEFINED IN Section 3.01(e)), all of such holders shares of Seller Common
Stock shall be deemed to be " _Non-Election Shares_ " and shall be convertible
at the discretion of Purchaser into either the Stock Consideration or the
Cash Consideration, or a combination thereof, subject to the allocation and
proration provisions in Section 3.01(h), Section 3.01(i) and Section 3.01(j).
__

 



9 __(c) _Company-Owned Stock_. Each share of Seller Common Stock held as
Company-Owned Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in
exchange therefor. __

 

 __(d) _Outstanding Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of Purchaser Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain issued and outstanding and unaffected by the Parent Merger. __

__(e) _Procedures for Election_. An election form and other appropriate
transmittal materials in such form as Seller and Purchaser shall mutually
agree (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed to shareholders of Seller
concurrent with or immediately after the mailing of the Proxy/Prospectus. The
" _Election Deadline_ " shall be 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the business
day that is five (5) business days preceding the Closing Date, after which an
Election may not be made. __

 

 __(f) _Perfection of the Election_. An Election shall be considered to have
been validly made by a Seller Common Shareholder only if the Exchange Agent
(as defined in Section 3.04) shall have received an Election Form properly
completed and executed by such shareholder prior to the Election Deadline.
Holders of record of shares of Seller Common Stock who hold such shares
as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities (a "
_Representative_ ") may submit multiple Election Forms, provided that such
Representative certifies that each such Election Form covers all the shares of
Seller Common Stock held by that Representative for a particular beneficial
owner. __

__(g) _Revocation of Election_. Any Seller Common Shareholder may at any time
prior to the Election Deadline revoke such shareholders Election and submit a
new Election Form by providing written notice that is received by the Exchange
Agent by 5:00 p.m., local time for the Exchange Agent, on the business day
prior to the Election Deadline. __

__(h) _Limitations on Stock Consideration_. Notwithstanding any
other provision contained in this Agreement, 80% of the total number of
shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding at the Effective Time (excluding
shares of Seller Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in Section 3.01(c))
(the " _Anticipated Stock Conversion Number_ ") shall be converted into the
Stock Consideration and the remaining outstanding shares of Seller Common
Stock (excluding shares of Seller Common Stock to be canceled as provided in
Section 3.01(c)) shall be converted into the Cash Consideration; provided,
however, that if the number of shares of Seller Common Stock (excluding shares
of Seller Common Stock to be cancelled as provided in Section 3.01(c)) with
respect to which Seller Common Shareholders have elected to receive the Stock
Consideration (whether in All-Stock Elections or in Mixed Elections) (the "
_Stock Election Number_ ") exceeds the Anticipated Stock Conversion Number,
then Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, increase the number of such
shares convertible into the Stock Consideration to a number not to exceed the
Stock Election Number (the " _Accommodation Stock Conversion Number_ ") and
the remaining outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock (excluding shares of
Seller Common Stock to be canceled as provided in Section 3.01(c)) shall be
converted into the Cash Consideration. __

 



10 __(i) _Allocation and Proration_. To the extent necessary to satisfy the
limitations in Section 3.01(h), within three business days after the Election
Deadline, Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent to effect the allocation
among holders of Seller Common Stock of rights to receive the Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows: __

__(i) If the Stock Election Number exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then
all shares with respect to which holders have made the Cash Election (" _Cash
Election Shares_ ") and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration, and each holder of Stock Election
Shares will be entitled to receive (A) the number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of
Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (2) the Stock Exchange Ratio by
(3) a fraction the numerator of which is the Stock Conversion Number and the
denominator of which is the Stock Election Number (the " _Stock Proration
Factor_ ") and (B) cash in an amount equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (1) the number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by
(2) the Cash Consideration by (3) one minus the Stock Proration Factor; __

 

 __(ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Anticipated Stock
Conversion Number (the amount by which the Anticipated Stock Conversion
Number exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the "
_Shortfall Number_ "), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and
Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner: __

__(A) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration and each holder of Non-Election Shares
shall receive (1) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held
by such holder by (y) the Stock Exchange Ratio by (z) a fraction the numerator
of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total
number of Non-Election Shares (the " _Non-Election Proration Factor_ ") and
(B) cash in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) the Cash
Consideration by (z) one minus the Non-Election Proration Factor; or __

__(B) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then
all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration, and each holder of Cash Election Shares shall receive (1) the
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y)
the Stock Exchange Ratio by (z) a fraction the numerator of which is the
amount by which the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election
Shares and the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election
Shares (the " _Cash Proration Factor_ ") and (B) cash in an amount equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares
held by such holder by (y) the Cash Consideration by (z) one minus the Cash
Proration Factor. __

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of one hundred (100) or
fewer shares of Seller Common Stock of record on the date of this Agreement
who have elected the All Cash Election shall not be required to have any of
their shares of Seller Common Stock converted into Purchaser Common Stock.

 



11 (j) _Dissenting Seller Common Shareholders_. __

 

 __(i) The outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock, the holders of which
have timely filed written notices of intention to demand appraisal for their
shares (" _Dissenting Seller Shares_ ") pursuant to Subchapter D of the PBCL
and have not effectively withdrawn or lost their dissenters rights under the
PBCL, shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger
Consideration under this Agreement, and the holders thereof shall be entitled
only to such rights as are granted by Subchapter D of the PBCL. __

 

(ii) If any such holder of Seller Common Stock shall have failed to perfect or
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost such right, and if such holder shall
have delivered a properly completed Election Form to the Exchange Agent by the
Election Deadline, the Dissenting Seller Shares held by such holder shall be
converted into a right to receive the Stock Consideration or the
Cash Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Agreement. If any such holder of Seller Common Stock shall have failed to
perfect or effectively shall have withdrawn or lost such right, and if such
holder shall not have delivered a properly completed Election Form to the
Exchange Agent by the Election Deadline, the Dissenting Seller Shares held by
such holder shall be designated as Non-Election Shares and shall be converted
on a share by share basis into either the right to receive the Stock
Consideration or the Cash Consideration in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this Agreement.

 

(iii) All payments in respect of Dissenting Seller Shares, if any, will be
made by Purchaser.

 

 __(k) _Tax Treatment of the Parent Merger_. For federal income tax purposes,
it is intended that the Parent Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, if necessary to assure that the Parent Merger will satisfy
continuity of interest requirements under applicable federal income
tax principles relating to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code,
as reasonably determined by counsel to Purchaser, Purchaser shall increase the
number of outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock that will be converted
into Purchaser Common Stock in the Parent Merger and reduce the number of
outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock that will be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration in the Parent Merger. __

 

Section 3.02 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time,
holders of Seller Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights
as, shareholders of Seller, other than to receive any dividend or other
distribution with respect to such Seller Common Stock with a record date
occurring prior to the Effective Time and the consideration provided under
this ARTICLE III. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of Seller or the Surviving Corporation of any shares
of Seller Common Stock.

 

Section 3.03 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
no fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Parent
Merger; instead, Purchaser shall pay to each holder of Seller Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Purchaser Common Stock
(after taking into account all Old Certificates (as defined below)

 



12  delivered by such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying such fractional share of Purchaser Common Stock to which the
holder would be entitled by the average of the high and low sale prices of
Purchaser Common Stock (as reported on Nasdaq) for the last trading day prior
to the Effective Date.

 

Section 3.04 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

 __(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit
in an escrow account of American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") at Purchaser Bank, for the benefit of the holders of
certificates formerly representing shares of Seller Common Stock (" _Old
Certificates_ ") an amount of cash necessary to make payments of cash to be
paid as part of the Merger Consideration (together with any dividends or
distributions on Purchaser Common Stock with a record date occurring on or
after the Effective Date with respect thereto without any interest on any such
cash, dividends or distributions) and shall provide the Exchange Agent with
the irrevocable authorization to issue sufficient certificates for shares of
Purchaser Common Stock (" _New Certificates_ ") for those shares of Seller
Common Stock being exchanged for Purchaser Common Stock in accordance with
this ARTICLE III. __

__(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, but in any event
within five business days after the Effective Date, the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each holder of an Old Certificate that has not previously submitted an
Election Form, transmittal materials (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") for
use in exchanging their Old Certificates for New Certificates and/or cash. The
Letter of Transmittal will contain instructions with respect to the surrender
of the Old Certificates and the receipt of the Merger Consideration in
exchange therefor. Upon the shareholders delivery to the Exchange Agent of
Old Certificates (or an indemnity affidavit reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser and the Exchange Agent, if any, if such certificates are lost,
stolen or destroyed), and the duly completed Letter of Transmittal, the
Exchange Agent shall cause New Certificates into which such shares of Seller
Common Stock are converted on the Effective Date to be delivered to such
shareholder and/or any check in respect of cash to be paid as part of the
Merger Consideration (and in respect of any fractional share interests,
dividends or distributions that such shareholder shall be entitled to
receive). No interest will be paid on any such cash to be paid in lieu of
fractional share interests or in respect of dividends or distributions on
Merger Consideration that any such shareholder shall be entitled to receive
pursuant to this ARTICLE III. __

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any former holder of Seller Common Stock for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Purchaser Common
Stock with a record date occurring on or after the Effective Date shall be
paid to the record holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate representing
shares of Seller Common Stock converted in the Parent Merger into the right
to receive shares of such Purchaser Common Stock until the holder thereof
receives New Certificates in exchange therefor in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 3.04. After becoming so entitled in
accordance with this Section 3.04, the record holder thereof also shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to shares
of Purchaser Common Stock, and which such holder had the right to receive upon
surrender of the Old Certificates.

 



13 Section 3.05 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event Purchaser changes the
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding between the
date hereof and the Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock
dividend, extraordinary dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, split
up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or similar transaction and
the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Date, the Stock
Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted. In addition, in the event
Purchaser enters into an agreement pursuant to which shares of Purchaser
Common Stock would be converted into shares or other securities or obligations
of another corporation, proper provision shall be made in such agreement so
that each Seller shareholder entitled to receive shares of Purchaser Common
Stock in the Parent Merger shall be entitled to receive such number of shares
or other securities or amount or obligations of such other corporation as such
shareholder would be entitled to receive if the Effective Date had
occurred immediately prior to the happening of such event. Furthermore, in
any such event described in this Section 3.05, the Cash Consideration shall
also be proportionately adjusted.

 

Section 3.06 _Options_. On the Effective Date, whether or not then
exercisable, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Seller Common
Stock (each, a "Seller Stock Option") shall be cancelled and each holder of a
Seller Stock Option shall receive from Seller, in consideration of the
cancellation of each Seller Stock Option held by such option holder, an amount
in cash equal to the difference between $52.50 and the exercise price of such
Seller Stock Option. Seller agrees to take the actions contemplated by the
Seller Stock Plans to permit the cancellation of Seller Stock Options
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence.

Affiliate_ ") or as to which Seller, any of its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA
Affiliate has, or may have, any liability or obligation, contingent or
otherwise, whether written or oral and whether legally binding or not
(collectively, the " _Plans_ "). Neither Seller, any of its Subsidiaries, nor
any ERISA Affiliate has any formal plan or commitment, whether legally binding

its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full,
and no condition exists that could reasonably be expected to result in the
Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring a liability under
such Title. No Plan is subject to Section 412, 430, 431, or 432 of the Code
or Title IV Section 302, 303, 304 or 305 of ERISA. None of the assets of
Seller, any of its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliate are subject to any
lien arising under ERISA or Subchapter D of Chapter 1 of the Code, and no
condition exists that presents a material risk of any such lien arising.

to Sellers knowledge, any of the Plans, nor any trust created thereunder,
nor any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a transaction in

any of the Plans or any such trust could (either directly or pursuant to any

arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), or a single employer
plan that has two or more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are not
under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063(a) of ERISA.

 

(vii) Each Plan that is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified (and each corresponding trust is
exempt under Section 501 of the Code) and has received or is the subject of a
favorable determination letter, opinion letter, or advisory letter from the
IRS relating to the most recently completed IRS remedial amendment period
cycle (" _RAP Cycle_ ") applicable thereto covering all of the applicable
provisions on the IRS cumulative list of covered qualification requirements
for such RAP Cycle, and nothing has occurred that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Plan (or the exempt
status of any related trust) or require the filing of a submission under the
IRSs employee plans compliance resolution system (" _EPCRS_ ") or the taking
of other corrective action pursuant to EPCRS in order to maintain such
qualified (or exempt) status. No Plan is the subject of any pending correction
or application under EPCRS.

the Code. Each Person who performs services for Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries, has been, and is, properly classified by Seller or the
Subsidiary as an employee or independent contractor.

(x) There are no claims pending, or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened
or anticipated (other than routine claims for benefits) against or involving
any Plan, the assets of any Plans or against Seller, any of its Subsidiaries,
or any ERISA Affiliate with respect to any Plan. There is no judgment,
decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator
outstanding against or in favor of any Plan or any fiduciary thereof (other
than rules of general applicability). There are no pending or threatened
audits or investigations by any Governmental Authority involving any Plan.

(xi) No Plan provides benefits, including without limitation death or medical
benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former
employees, directors or other service providers after retirement or other
termination of service (other than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law,
(ii) death benefits or retirement benefits under any "employee pension benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), or (iii) deferred compensation
benefits accrued as liabilities in the Financial Statements). No Plan is
funded through a "welfare benefit fund" as defined in Section 419 of the Code.

(xii) Each Plan may be amended or terminated without liability to Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries, other than liability for accrued benefits through the
date of the amendment or termination and administrative costs of amending or
terminating the Plan. Neither the execution of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will (either alone or
together with any other event) result in or is a precondition to (i) any
current or former employee, director or other service provider of or
to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries becoming entitled to severance pay or
any similar payment, (ii) the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting
of, or an increase in the amount of, any compensation due to any current or
former employee, director or other service provider of or to Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (iii) the renewal or extension of the term of any
agreement regarding the compensation of any current or former employee,
director or other service provider of or to Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(xiii) Each Plan that provides deferred compensation subject to Section 409A
of the Code complies with Section 409A of the Code (and has so complied for
the entire period during which Section 409A of the Code has applied to such
Plan), and none of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will result
in a violation of Section 409A of the Code.

 



26 (xiv) No Plan subject to Title I of ERISA holds any "employer security"
or "employer real property" (each as defined in Section 407(d) of ERISA).

former employee, director or other service provider of or to Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries are fully insured by a third party insurance carrier.

with the requirements of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Public Law 111-148), as amended by the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152), to the extent applicable.

(ii) Since December 31, 2013, no event has occurred or circumstance arisen

(except to extent expressly permitted by such rules and regulations),

under the caption "Item 2. Properties" as being owned by Purchaser or
Purchaser Bank, as applicable, as of December 31, 2013, except (i) statutory
liens for amounts not yet due and payable, (ii) pledges to secure deposits and
other liens incurred in the ordinary course of banking business, (iii) such
imperfections of title, easements, encumbrances, liens, charges, defaults or
equitable interests, if any, as do not affect the use of properties or assets
subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair
business operations at such properties, (iv) dispositions and encumbrances in
the ordinary course of business, and (v) liens on properties acquired in

the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights and to
general equity principles, in each case other than loans as to which the
failure to satisfy the foregoing standards would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Purchaser. All loans and extensions of credit that have been made

 __(aa) _Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC and Customer
Information_. Purchaser is not aware of, has not been advised of, and has no
reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause it
or Purchaser Bank to be deemed (i) to be operating in violation in any
material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, any order issued
with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the
Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-
money laundering statute, rule or regulation; or (ii) not to be in
satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the applicable privacy
and customer information requirements contained in any federal and state
privacy laws and regulations, including, without limitation, in Title V of the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as
well as the provisions of the information security program adopted by Seller
pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part 364. Purchaser is not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would cause it to believe that any non-public
customer information has been disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized
third party in a manner that would cause it or Purchaser Bank to undertake any
material remedial action. The Purchaser Board (or, where appropriate, the
board of directors of Purchaser Bank) has adopted and implemented an anti-
money laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures that comply with Section 326 of the
Patriot Act and such anti-money laundering program meets the requirements in
all material respects of Section 352 of the Patriot Act and the regulations
thereunder, and it (or such other of its Subsidiaries) has complied in all
material respects with any requirements to file reports and other necessary
documents as required by the Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder. __

__(bb) _Trust Accounts_. Purchaser and Purchaser Bank, respectively, have
administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including but not
limited to accounts for which it serves as trustee, agent, custodian, personal
representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in all material
respects in accordance with the terms of the governing documents and
applicable laws and regulations. __

advisable under applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger

sentence, in the event that subsequent to the date of this Agreement the
Seller Board determines after consultation with independent legal counsel that
its fiduciary duties require it to withdraw, modify or qualify such
recommendation, the Seller Board may, prior to the Seller Meeting, so
withdraw, modify or qualify its adoption of this Agreement or such
recommendation.

Section 6.03 _Registration Statement._

 

 __(a) Purchaser agrees to prepare, pursuant to all applicable laws, rules and
regulations, a registration statement on Form S-4 (the " _Registration
Statement_ ") to be filed by Purchaser with the SEC in connection with the
issuance of Purchaser Common Stock in the Parent Merger (including the proxy
statement and prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of Seller
constituting a part thereof (the " _Proxy/Prospectus_ ") and all related
documents). Seller agrees to cooperate, and to cause its Subsidiaries to

event later than 45 days after the date hereof. Each of Seller and Purchaser
agrees to use all reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after filing thereof. Purchaser also agrees to use all reasonable
efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement,
all necessary state securities law or _"_ Blue Sky _"_ permits and approvals

(b) Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement
will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement

untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and (ii) the Proxy/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement

the circumstances under which such statement is made, not false or misleading.
Each of Seller and Purchaser further agrees that if it shall become aware
prior to the Effective Date of any information furnished by it that would
cause any of the statements in the Proxy/Prospectus to be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly
inform the other party thereof and to take the necessary steps to correct the
Proxy/Prospectus.

 



43 (c) Purchaser agrees to advise Seller, promptly after Purchaser receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of
any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of Purchaser Common
Stock for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat
of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or for additional
information.

 

Section 6.04 _Press Releases_. Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees that it
will not, without the prior approval of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, issue any press release or written statement for
general circulation relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, except
that nothing herein shall prohibit either party, following notification to
the other party, from making any disclosure required by applicable law or
regulation or Nasdaq rules.

Section 6.05 _Access; Information_.

(a) Seller agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, it shall afford Purchaser and

independent auditors), properties, personnel and to such other information as
Purchaser may reasonably request and, during such period, it shall furnish
promptly to Purchaser (i) a copy of each material report, schedule and other
document filed by Seller pursuant to federal or state securities or banking
laws, and (ii) all other information concerning the business, properties and
personnel of Seller as Purchaser may reasonably request. In no event,
however, is Seller obligated to (i) provide access or disclose any information
to Purchaser where such access or disclosure would violate any agreement not
to disclose confidential information; or (ii) provide access to board minutes
that discuss of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any
Acquisition Proposal or any other subject matter Seller reasonably determines
should be treated as confidential.

 

(b) Each of Purchaser and Seller agrees that it will not, and will cause its
representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
6.05 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in
connection with the entering into of this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to the requirements of law, each party will keep
confidential, and will cause its representatives to keep confidential, all
information and documents obtained pursuant to this Section 6.05 (as well as
any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with
the entering into of this Agreement) unless such information (i) was already
known to such party, (ii) becomes available to such party from other sources
not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is
disclosed with the prior written approval of the party to which such
information pertains or (iv) is or becomes readily ascertainable from
published information or trade sources. No investigation by either party of
the business and affairs of the other shall affect or be deemed to modify or
waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement,
or the conditions to either partys obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



44 (c) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
Seller shall cause one or more of its representatives to confer with
representatives of Purchaser and report the general status of its ongoing
operations at such times as Purchaser may reasonably request. Seller will
promptly notify Purchaser of any material change in the normal course of its
business or in the operation of its properties and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or
communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the
institution or the threat of material litigation involving Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, senior officers of Purchaser
and Seller shall meet on a reasonably regular basis (expected to be at least
monthly) to review the financial and operational affairs of Seller and its
Subsidiaries, in accordance with applicable law, and Seller shall give due
consideration to Purchasers input on such matters, with the understanding

Bank of third-party service provider arrangements effective at the
Effective Time or at a date thereafter, non-renewal of personal property
leases and software licenses used by the Bank in connection with its systems
operations, retention of outside consultants and additional employees to
assist with the conversion, and outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary
or self-provided system services, it being understood that the Bank shall not
be obligated to take any such action prior to the Effective Time and, unless
the Bank otherwise agrees, no conversion shall take place prior to the
Effective Time. In the event that the Bank takes, at the request of Purchaser
Bank, any action relative to third parties to facilitate the conversion that
results in the imposition of any termination fees or charges, Purchaser Bank
shall indemnify the Bank for any such fees and charges, and the costs of
reversing the conversion process, if for any reason the Parent Merger is not
consummated for any reason other than a breach of this Agreement by Seller.

(a) Seller agrees that after the date hereof, neither it nor any of its
subsidiaries nor any of its respective officers and directors or the officers
and directors of any of its subsidiaries shall, and it shall direct and use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its employees and agents, including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or by any of its
subsidiaries (collectively, its "Representatives") not to, initiate, solicit
or encourage, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or
implementation of any Acquisition Proposal, or, except to the extent that the
Seller Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial and legal advisors, that such action is required in order for the
Seller Board to comply with its fiduciary duties, engage in any negotiations
concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or have any
discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal or otherwise
facilitate any effort or attempt to implement or make an Acquisition Proposal

advise Purchaser, orally and in writing, of (x) the receipt by it (or any of
the other persons referred to above) of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
or any material modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition
Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person or entity that informs the
Seller Board or the board of directors of any of its Subsidiaries that it is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal and (y) the material
terms and conditions of such proposal or inquiry (whether written or oral) or
modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) keep Purchaser
fully informed of the status and details of any such proposal or inquiry and
any developments with respect thereto. Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements in
accordance with the terms thereof, and shall immediately take all steps

any such provisions authorizing any Person to make an Acquisition Proposal. "

of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the

terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other

Purchaser who have been furnished confidential information regarding Seller
or its Subsidiaries in connection with the solicitation of or discussions
regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date

necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or, if
necessary, challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable
Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect. Neither party will take any
action that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby not to comply

within its control to make those transactions comply with (or continue to
comply with) the Takeover Provisions.

limitations imposed under applicable law or by any Regulatory Authority;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not prevent Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any such agreement in
accordance with its terms and applicable law.

 



48 (c) After the Effective Date, each Continuing Employee who was not a party to
an agreement listed on Section 6.12(b) of the Disclosure Schedule delivered
by Seller to Purchaser and whose employment with Purchaser (or one of its
Subsidiaries) is terminated by Purchaser (or the applicable Subsidiary)
without cause (as determined by Purchaser in its discretion) within six

director or officer of Seller (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is
threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a
director, officer or employee of Seller, or any of its Subsidiaries or any of

and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each such Indemnified Party
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including

thereof and upon such assumption Purchaser shall not be liable to any
Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the

or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified
Parties that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between
Purchaser and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after notification, and Purchaser
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties, (2) Purchaser shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay
for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties, (3) Purchaser shall
not be liable for any __

obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final and nonappealable, that indemnification of such
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law or to any Indemnified Party that _commits fraud. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim Indemnification under this Section
6.12(h), upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof, provided that the
failure of any Indemnified Party to so notify Purchaser shall not relieve it
of its obligations hereunder except (and only) to the extent that such failure
materially prejudices Purchaser. Purchasers obligations under this Section
6.12(h) continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the
Effective Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any claim (a "Claim") asserted or made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Claim. _

incorporation, bylaws or similar governing documents as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Date shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect, and shall be honored by such entities or their respective successors
as if they were the indemnifying party thereunder, without any amendment
thereto, for a period of six years from the Effective Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition
of such Claim; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in
this Section 6.12(i) shall be deemed to preclude the liquidation,
consolidation or merger of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, in which case
all of such rights to indemnification and limitations on liability shall be
deemed to so survive and continue as an obligation of Purchaser or the
successor to Seller or its Subsidiary notwithstanding any such liquidation,
consolidation or merger. __

 

 __(j) Purchaser, from and after the Effective Date will use its reasonable
best efforts directly or indirectly to cause the persons who served as
directors or officers of Seller on or before the Effective Date to be covered
by Seller s existing directors and officers liability insurance policy
(provided that Purchaser may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not
less advantageous than such policy) but in no event shall any insured person
be entitled under this Section 6.12(j) to insurance coverage more favorable
than that provided to him or her in such capacities as of the date hereof
with respect to acts or omissions resulting from their service as such on or
prior to the Effective Date. Such insurance coverage, if reasonably available
at a reasonable cost relative to the coverage obtained, shall commence on the
Effective Date and will be provided for a period of no less than six years
after the Effective Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Purchaser be required to expend more than 200% of the current amount expended
by Seller (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") to maintain or procure insurance
coverage pursuant hereto and, _provided_ , _further_ , that the Insurance
Amount shall be deemed reasonable for purposes of this Section 6.12(j).
Seller agrees to renew any such existing insurance or to purchase any
"discovery period" insurance provided for thereunder at Purchasers request.

consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.12.

 

(l) The provisions of Section 6.12(h), Section 6.12(i), Section 6.12(j) and
Section 6.12(k) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and their respective heirs and
representatives.

shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known
to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all

Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements

of this Agreement and the Effective Time, without the written consent of the

members of its entire Board, in the event that the Parent Merger is not
consummated by May 31, 2015, except to the extent that the failure of the
Parent Merger then to be consummated arises out of or results from the
knowing action or inaction of the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this

any Governmental Authority required for consummation of the Merger and the

period, it shall give prompt written notice to Seller of such election and

Section 9.07 _Entire Understanding; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement and any separate agreement entered into by the parties of even date
herewith represent the entire understanding of the parties hereto with
reference to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and this
Agreement supersedes any and all other oral or written agreements heretofore
made (other than any such separate agreement). Nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than

obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement; provided
that the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries of and
entitled to enforce Section 6.12.

remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated thereby, so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination, the parties will negotiate in
good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable and equitable
substitute provision to effect the original intent of the parties.
