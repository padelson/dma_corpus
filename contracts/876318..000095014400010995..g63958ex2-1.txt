AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as
of August 26, 2000, between DEUTSCHE TELEKOM AG, an AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT
organized and existing under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany
("DT"), and POWERTEL, INC., a Delaware corporation ("POWERTEL") (each a
"PARTY" and, together, the "PARTIES").   WITNESSETH:   WHEREAS,
VoiceStream Wireless Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("VOICESTREAM"), and
DT entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 23, 2000 (as
amended or modified from time to time, the "VOICESTREAM MERGER AGREEMENT"),
providing for the acquisition of VoiceStream by DT (the "VOICESTREAM MERGER")
and VoiceStream and Powertel are entering into a separate merger agreement
dated as of the date hereof (as amended or modified from time to time (the
"ALTERNATIVE MERGER AGREEMENT"), providing for the acquisition of Powertel by
VoiceStream (the "ALTERNATIVE MERGER") if the VoiceStream Merger Agreement is
terminated and certain other conditions are satisfied or waived;   WHEREAS,
the Management Board (VORSTAND) and the Supervisory Board (AUFSICHTSRAT) of
DT and the Board of Directors of Powertel have determined that it is fair to
and in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders to
consummate the strategic combination transaction provided for in this
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance
with the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization and have
authorized the execution and delivery of this Agreement;   WHEREAS,
simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Alternative Merger Agreement, as part of a single overall transaction, and to
induce DT to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of Powertel are
each entering into a stockholder agreement (collectively, the "POWERTEL
STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS") with DT dated as of the date hereof;   WHEREAS, for
United States federal income tax purposes the parties intend that the Merger
(as defined below) will qualify (i) as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code (as defined below) and (ii) for an exception to
the general rule of Section 367(a)(1) of the Code; and   WHEREAS, DT and
Powertel desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein
contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, DT and Powertel hereby
agree as follows:    10   ARTICLE 1.   THE MERGER   SECTION 1.01.
Appointment of Escrow Agent and Formation of Merger Sub. (a) As soon as
practicable after the execution of this agreement, DT shall cause to be
incorporated pursuant to Delaware Law, a corporation which shall be
a constituent company in the Merger ("MERGER SUB"). DT shall own 100 percent
of the outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub.   (b) As soon as
practicable after the date hereof, DT shall appoint a United States bank or
trust company or other independent financial institution in the United States
reasonably satisfactory to Powertel to act, inter alia, as escrow agent and
exchange agent for the Merger and the delivery of the Merger Consideration
(as defined below) to former stockholders of Powertel and the other Merger
Consideration Recipients (as defined below) (the "ESCROW AGENT"). DT and
Powertel shall enter into an escrow agency agreement with the Escrow Agent,
in substantially the same form as the Escrow Agency Agreement to be entered
into in connection with the VoiceStream Merger Agreement but with
such changes as may be appropriate (the "ESCROW AGENCY AGREEMENT"), which
agreement shall set forth the duties, responsibilities and obligations of the
Escrow Agent consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Solely to
accommodate the transactions described in this Article 1 and subject to the
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agency Agreement, one day prior to the
Effective Time DT shall cause the Escrow Agent to be registered, as DT\'s
fiduciary (for the period prior to the Effective Time) as the record holder
of all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$.000001 per share, of Merger Sub (the "MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK").  
SECTION 1.02. The Merger. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement and in accordance with Delaware Law, on the Closing Date (as
defined below), Powertel will cause a certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE
OF MERGER") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware and make all other filings or recordings required by applicable
law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or at such later time as is specified in
the Certificate of Merger in accordance with Delaware Law (the "EFFECTIVE
TIME").   (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into Powertel in accordance with Delaware Law (the "MERGER"), whereupon the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, Powertel shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") and shall continue to
be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate corporate
existence of Powertel, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger except as set forth
in this Article 1. The Merger shall have the effects specified in Delaware
Law.   SECTION 1.03. The Closing. On the fifth Business Day after the last
to be fulfilled or waived of the conditions set forth in Article 6 hereof
(other than the conditions contained in Sections 6.02(c), 6.02(d), 6.02(e),
6.03(c), 6.03(d) and 6.03(e) so long as it is reasonably apparent that such
conditions and the condition contained in Section 6.01(b) will be     
2  11  able to be satisfied at the Closing) shall be fulfilled or waived in
accordance with this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING")
shall be held (but only after all of the conditions set forth in Article 6
shall have been satisfied or waived prior to the Effective Time) at such time
as DT and Powertel shall agree (the "CLOSING DATE") at the offices of Cleary,
Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton, New York, New York, unless this Agreement shall
have been terminated and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
abandoned pursuant to Article 7 or unless another date, time or place is
agreed to in writing by DT and Powertel.   SECTION 1.04. The Merger
Exchange.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agency Agreement, as soon as possible after the
Effective Time, (x) on the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall contribute,
for the account of the former stockholders of Powertel, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation Common Stock (as defined
below) to DT as a transfer in kind, and (y) DT shall deliver the Merger
Consideration to the Escrow Agent for the account of (i) the former
stockholders of Powertel, (ii) the Options Trustee (as defined in Annex
1.08(a)), (iii) the Warrants Trustee (as defined in Annex 1.05(h)) and (iv)
the Eliska Partners Shares Trustee (as defined in Annex 1.05(i))
(collectively, the "MERGER CONSIDERATION RECIPIENTS"). DT and the Escrow
Agent shall effect the foregoing in accordance with Sections 183 et seq. and
203 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (AKTIENGESETZ) (the
"GERMAN ACT") by registering the increase of the DT stated share capital with
the commercial register (HANDELSREGISTER) for DT (the "COMMERCIAL REGISTER")
as soon as possible after the Effective Time. In the event that, in
connection with the performance of DT\'s obligations in this Section 1.04(a),
on or prior to the Closing Date the Management Board of DT passes a
resolution to increase the issued capital of DT in accordance with Article
5(2) of the Articles of Association of DT by such number of shares as is
equal to the number of shares to be delivered as part of the Merger
Consideration, and the Supervisory Board shall have consented thereto, then
(i) the Escrow Agent shall promptly subscribe for such new ordinary shares of
DT ("DT ORDINARY SHARES") to be issued as part of the Merger Consideration
and shall promptly on the Closing Date make the contribution to DT referred
to in the first sentence of this Section 1.04(a) and (ii) the Management
Board and the chairman of the Supervisory Board shall as soon as possible
thereafter file the application for registration of the implementation of the
capital increase with the Commercial Register, with the effect that, on
registration of the capital increase in the Commercial Register, such new DT
Ordinary Shares shall by operation of law be held solely by the Escrow Agent
for delivery to and for the benefit of the Merger Consideration Recipients.
At the Effective Time, the obligations of DT and the Escrow Agent under this
Section 1.04(a) shall be unconditional.   (b) Each share certificate (a
"CERTIFICATE") formerly representing any Powertel Stock (as defined below)
(other than Excluded Powertel Shares (as defined below)) shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in
Section 1.05(b) and the right, if any, to receive pursuant to Section 1.09
cash in lieu of fractional DT Depositary Shares (as defined below) or
fractional DT Ordinary Shares, as applicable, and any dividend or
distribution pursuant to Section 1.06(f), in each case, without interest.
The DT Ordinary Shares and the DT Depositary Shares issued as provided in
Section 1.05 shall be of the same class and shall have the same rights as the
currently outstanding DT Ordinary Shares and the currently outstanding DT
Depositary Shares, respectively.     3  12   SECTION 1.05. Conversion
and Exchange of Shares. At the Effective Time:   (a) Each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Powertel ("POWERTEL COMMON STOCK") and
Powertel Preferred Stock (as defined below) owned by DT or Powertel
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an "EXCLUDED POWERTEL SHARE")
shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, no longer be outstanding, be cancelled and retired without
payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.   (b) By
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof
(in each of the following cases other than Excluded Powertel Shares) and
subject to the further provisions of this Section 1.05:   (i) each share of
Powertel Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right  to receive 2.6353 validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable DT Ordinary  Shares (the "COMMON STOCK
EXCHANGE RATIO");   (ii) each share of Powertel Series A Preferred Shares
(as defined  below) and Powertel Series B Preferred Shares (as defined below)
issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into  the right to receive 121.9294 validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable  DT Ordinary Shares (the "SERIES A AND B PREFERRED EXCHANGE
RATIO");   (iii) each share of Powertel Series D Preferred Shares (as
defined  below) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall  be converted into the right to receive 93.0106 validly issued,
fully paid  and nonassessable DT Ordinary Shares (the "SERIES D PREFERRED
EXCHANGE  RATIO"); and   (iv) each share of Powertel Series E Preferred
Shares (as defined  below) and Powertel Series F Preferred Shares (as defined
below) issued and  outstanding prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right  to receive (A) 179.5979 validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable DT  Ordinary Shares (the "SERIES E AND F PREFERRED EXCHANGE
RATIO"), plus (B) a  number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
DT Ordinary Shares  equal to the product of the number of shares of Powertel
Common Stock  representing accrued or declared but unpaid dividends on such
Powertel  Series E Preferred Share or Powertel Series F Preferred Share
(calculated  as if the Closing Date were a dividend payment date), as the
case may be,  and the Common Stock Exchange Ratio.  The consideration
payable pursuant to this paragraph (b) is referred to herein as the "MERGER
CONSIDERATION."   (c) Any DT Ordinary Shares constituting a portion of the
Merger Consideration shall be delivered to the holders of Powertel Stock in
the form of American depositary shares, each representing the right to
receive one DT Ordinary Share (the "DT DEPOSITARY SHARES"). The DT Depositary
Shares may be evidenced by one or more receipts ("DT ADRS") issued in
accordance with the Deposit Agreement, dated as of November 18, 1996, as
amended, among     4  13  DT, Citibank N.A., as Depositary (the
"DEPOSITARY"), and the holders and beneficial owners from time to time of DT
ADRs, as it may be further amended from time to time (the "DEPOSIT
AGREEMENT"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Person who is entitled to
receive DT Ordinary Shares as Merger Consideration shall be entitled, with
respect to all or any portion of his Powertel Stock, to make an unconditional
and irrevocable election (the "ORDINARY SHARE ELECTION") to receive DT
Ordinary Shares in lieu of DT Depositary Shares. The Letter of Transmittal
(as defined below) shall contain a form of Ordinary Share Election and shall
be used by each holder of Powertel Stock who wishes to make an Ordinary Share
Election.   (d) Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger, and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, no longer
be outstanding, be cancelled and retired. Immediately following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall issue to the Escrow Agent a number of
shares of common stock, par value $0.000001 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation ("SURVIVING CORPORATION COMMON STOCK") equal to the total number
of Adjusted Fully Diluted Shares (as defined below) outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger in consideration of the payment by the Escrow Agent to
the Surviving Corporation of an amount equal to the product of the number of
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock and the par value of such
shares.   (e) In consideration of the contribution to DT by the Escrow Agent
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.04(a) hereof, DT
shall issue, in accordance with Section 1.04(a), and deliver to the Escrow
Agent, the maximum number of DT Ordinary Shares (including DT Ordinary Shares
underlying DT Depositary Shares that are to be delivered as part of the
Merger Consideration) that has become payable pursuant to Section 1.05 for
delivery to the Merger Consideration Recipients entitled thereto.   (f) If,
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, all of the
outstanding DT Ordinary Shares, or more than 80% of the outstanding
DT Ordinary Shares pursuant to an exchange offer for all outstanding shares,
shall have been changed into or exchanged for a different number of shares or
kind of shares of DT or another corporation or entity owning more than 80% of
the DT Ordinary Shares, or the DT Ordinary Shares outstanding shall have
changed, by reason of any reclassification, split-up, stock-split, reverse
stock-split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or
redenomination of share capital, merger or similar statutory procedure or
pursuant to an exchange offer, or DT changes the number of DT Ordinary Shares
represented by a DT Depositary Share, then the Common Stock Exchange Ratio,
the Series A and B Preferred Exchange Ratio, the Series D Preferred Exchange
Ratio, the Series E and F Preferred Exchange Ratio and the amount of any
portion of the Merger Consideration that would otherwise be payable in DT
Ordinary Shares and the issuer thereof and other definitions and provisions
of this Agreement dependent thereon shall be appropriately adjusted.   (g)
In the event that the aggregate number of shares of Powertel Common Stock and
the Powertel Common Stock Equivalents (as defined below) ("ADJUSTED FULLY
DILUTED SHARES") exceeds the Maximum Share Amount as of the Effective Time,
excluding, for purposes of this Section 1.05(g), Powertel Common
Stock issuable after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time in
respect of dividends accrued on the Series E Preferred Shares and the Series
F Preferred Shares, each of the Common Stock Exchange Ratio, the Series A and
B Preferred Exchange Ratio, the Series D Preferred Exchange Ratio and the
Series E and F Preferred Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted by multiplying each
of the Common Stock Exchange Ratio, the Series A and B Preferred Exchange
Ratio, the Series D Preferred Exchange Ratio and the Series E and F    
5  14  Preferred Exchange Ratio by a fraction the numerator of which shall
be the Maximum Share Amount and the denominator of which shall be the number
of Adjusted Fully Diluted Shares as of the Effective Time. Except as
described in the preceding sentence, the number of shares of Powertel Common
Stock and Powertel Common Stock Equivalents for the purpose of such
recalculation shall be determined in the same manner as described in SCHEDULE
2.03, including the shares of Powertel Stock actually outstanding and shares
of Powertel Stock issuable (i) in exchange for Powertel Preferred Stock, (ii)
pursuant to Powertel Stock Options (as defined below) and Powertel Warrants
(as defined below), (iii) pursuant to Powertel Restricted Stock Awards (as
defined below), (iv) in connection with the Eliska Put Rights, (v) pursuant
to the Sonera Stock Purchase Agreement (as defined below) and (vi) any other
Powertel Common Stock and Powertel Common Stock Equivalents outstanding as of
the Effective Time. For purposes of this Section 1.05(g), the "Maximum Share
Amount" means 55,784,000 shares; provided, however, that if prior to the
Effective Time the Stock Purchase Agreement between Powertel and Sonera B.V.
relating to the DiGiPH Transaction (the "SONERA STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT") or
the Eliska Put or the Sonera Put shall have been terminated, the Maximum
Share Amount shall be appropriately reduced.   (h) Warrants. If all the
warrants (the "POWERTEL WARRANTS") to purchase Powertel Common Stock issued
by Powertel pursuant to the Warrant Agreement (the "POWERTEL WARRANT
AGREEMENT") dated February 7, 1996 between Powertel and Bankers Trust
Company, as warrant agent, shall not have been exercised prior to the
Effective Time and any holder of such Powertel Warrants becomes entitled
to DT Ordinary Shares after the Effective Time, such DT Ordinary Shares to
which such holder of Powertel Warrants is entitled will be issued from a U.S.
trust, as described in Annex 1.05(h) (which shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to DT and Powertel, the "WARRANTS TRUST"), and to the
extent any holder of Powertel Warrants becomes entitled to cash payment after
the Effective Time, such cash payment to which such holder of Powertel
Warrants is entitled will be paid by DT.   (i) Eliska Partners.   (i) To
the extent that prior to the Effective Time, any of the Eliska  Partners
receives Powertel Common Stock in respect of its rights to sell  its interest
in the Eliska Joint Venture pursuant to (x) the Put Agreement  dated May 30,
2000 between Powertel and Sonera Holding B.V. (the "SONERA  PUT") or (y) the
Put Agreement dated May 30, 2000 between Powertel, Eliska  Wireless Investors
I, L.P. ("ELISKA") and Sonera Holding B.V. (the "ELISKA  PUT," and together
with the Sonera Put, the "ELISKA PUT RIGHTS"), such  Eliska Partner shall
have all the rights with respect to such Powertel  Common Stock which a
Powertel stockholder has.   (ii) To the extent that any of the Eliska
Partners does not receive  Powertel Common Stock prior to the Effective Time
in respect of its Eliska  Put Rights, such Eliska Partner shall be entitled
to receive DT Ordinary  Shares, DT Depositary Shares or cash as the case may
be, pursuant to the  Eliska Put Rights. To the extent that, on or after the
Effective Time, an  Eliska Partner is entitled to DT Ordinary Shares, such
shares will be  delivered from a U.S. trust, as described in Annex 1.05(i)
(which shall be  in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to DT and
Powertel, the  "ELISKA PARTNERS SHARES     6  15   TRUST") and to the
extent that such Eliska Partner is entitled to cash,  such cash shall be paid
by DT. The consideration payable to an Eliska  Partner pursuant to this
clause (ii) shall not constitute Merger  Consideration for the purpose of
this Agreement.   (iii) Prior to the date hereof Powertel, DT and the Eliska
Partners  have entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Eliska
Partners have  consented to the assumption by DT of Powertel\'s obligations
under the  Eliska Put Rights and the treatment of the Eliska Put Rights as 
contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 1.06. Surrender and Payment. (a)
Promptly after the Effective Time, DT shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to send, or will cause the Escrow Agent to send, to each holder of record as
of the Effective Time of Powertel Stock (other than holders of Excluded
Powertel Shares) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that the
delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of a Certificate to the Escrow Agent, and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender to the Escrow Agent of
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (the "LETTER OF
TRANSMITTAL"). The Letter of Transmittal shall contain such other terms and
conditions as DT and Powertel may reasonably specify.   (b) Each record
holder of any Powertel Stock (other than Excluded Powertel Shares) shall,
upon surrender to the Escrow Agent of a Certificate or Certificates
representing such shares of Powertel Stock, together with a properly
completed Letter of Transmittal covering the Powertel Stock represented by
such Certificate or Certificates, without further action, be entitled
to receive, and the Escrow Agent shall deliver (and DT shall cause the Escrow
Agent to deliver) to each such holder, subject to Section 1.06(e) below, (i)
the number of whole DT Depositary Shares or DT Ordinary Shares included in
the Merger Consideration in respect of such Powertel Stock, subject to
the provisions of Section 1.05, and (ii) a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required tax withholdings) of (A) any cash in lieu of
Fractional Interests (as defined below) to be paid pursuant to Section 1.09,
plus (B) any cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 1.06(f). Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only
the right to receive the number of whole DT Depositary Shares or DT Ordinary
Shares, as applicable, to which it is entitled pursuant to Section 1.05 and
the applicable amounts of cash provided in the foregoing clause (ii) of the
preceding sentence.   (c) If any DT Depositary Shares or DT Ordinary Shares
are to be delivered to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Powertel Stock represented by a Certificate or Certificates surrendered with
respect thereto, it shall be a condition to such issuance that the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
delivery shall pay to the Escrow Agent any transfer or other taxes required
as a result of such delivery to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Powertel Stock or establish to the satisfaction of the Escrow Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d) The stock transfer books of
Powertel shall be closed after the close of trading on the National Market
System (the "NASDAQ") on the trading day immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Powertel Common Stock that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time.
After the Effective Time,     7  16  Certificates presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article 1.   (e) Any DT Ordinary Shares issued and delivered in
respect of Powertel Stock pursuant to this Article 1 and any cash in lieu of
Fractional Interests to be paid pursuant to Section 1.09, plus any cash
dividend or other distribution that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.06(f) that remains unclaimed by any holder of Powertel
Stock six months after the Effective Time, shall be held by the Escrow Agent
(or a successor agent appointed by DT) or shall be delivered to the
Depositary upon the instruction of DT and held by the Depositary, in either
case subject to the instruction of DT, in an account or accounts designated
for such purpose. None of DT, Merger Sub, Powertel, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Powertel Stock for any
securities delivered or any amount paid by the Depositary, the Escrow Agent
or its nominee, as the case may be, to a public official which it is so
required to pay under applicable abandoned property laws. Any cash remaining
unclaimed by holders of Powertel Stock five years after the Effective Time
(or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such cash would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental or Regulatory
Authority or as is otherwise provided by any applicable Legal Requirement (as
defined below)) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, become the property of the Surviving Corporation or DT, as DT
may determine.   (f) No dividends or other distributions nor any voting
rights with respect to securities of DT issuable to the Escrow Agent with
respect to Powertel Stock shall be paid to or exercised by the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates until such Certificates are surrendered as
provided in this Section. Subject to the effect of applicable Legal
Requirements, upon such surrender, there shall be issued and/or paid to the
holder of DT Depositary Shares or DT Ordinary Shares issued in exchange
therefor, without interest and after giving effect to any required tax
withholding, (A) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such DT Depositary Shares or DT
Ordinary Shares with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and
(B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such DT Depositary Shares or DT Ordinary Shares with
a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to
such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect
of DT Depositary Shares or DT Ordinary Shares, all DT Depositary Shares and
DT Ordinary Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued
and outstanding as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
dividends or other distributions nor any voting rights with respect to
securities of DT issuable to the Escrow Agent for the account of the Options
Trustee, the Warrants Trustee and the Eliska Partners Trustee shall be paid
to or exercised by any such trustees.   SECTION 1.07. [Reserved]   SECTION
1.08. Treatment of Powertel Option Plans. (a) Subject to the consummation of
the Merger, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding
Powertel Stock Option will be converted (and such Powertel Stock Option will
be extinguished) into a right to acquire (each, a "POWERTEL ROLLOVER OPTION")
from a U.S. trust, as described in Annex 1.08(a) (which shall be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to DT and Powertel,     8  17  the
"OPTIONS TRUST") on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under the Powertel Stock Option (but taking into account any changes
thereto, including any acceleration thereof, provided for in the option award
or in the Powertel Stock Option Plans listed on SCHEDULE 1.08 and applicable
to such Powertel Stock Options by reason of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby) that number of DT Ordinary Shares (the
"POWERTEL OPTION AMOUNT") determined by multiplying the maximum number of
shares of Powertel Common Stock subject to such Powertel Stock Option by the
Common Stock Exchange Ratio, rounded if necessary to the nearest whole DT
Ordinary Share at an exercise price per DT Ordinary Share equal to the
exercise price per share of Powertel Common Stock in effect with respect to
such Powertel Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
the Common Stock Exchange Ratio. In order to implement the conversion of the
Powertel Stock Options described above, the arrangements set forth in Annex
1.08(a) will be effected at the Effective Time. In the case of a Powertel
Stock Option which is intended to be an incentive stock option under Section
422 of the Code, the adjustment in this Section 1.08 shall be modified if
necessary to permit such Powertel Stock Option to continue to comply with
Section 422 of the Code.   (b) To the extent that any Person would otherwise
be entitled to receive a fraction of a DT Ordinary Share pursuant to this
Section 1.08, such fraction shall be treated in accordance with Section
1.09.   (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, DT shall cause
to be delivered to the holders of Powertel Stock Options appropriate
notices setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to the respective
Powertel Stock Option Plans and agreements evidencing the grants of such
Powertel Stock Options (including that, in connection with the Merger and to
the extent provided by the terms of the Powertel Stock Option Plans award
agreements thereunder, the Powertel Stock Options subject to change of
control vesting have become fully vested).   (d) No later than the
Effective Time, DT shall file or cause to be filed with the SEC a
registration statement on an appropriate form or a post-effective amendment
to a previously filed registration statement under the Securities Act with
respect to the DT Ordinary Shares and DT Depositary Shares which are subject
to the Powertel Rollover Options as provided in Section 1.08(a), and shall
use reasonable best efforts to maintain the current status of the prospectus
associated therewith, as well as to comply with any applicable state
securities or "blue sky" laws for so long as such options
remain outstanding.   SECTION 1.09. Fractional DT Depositary Shares and
Fractional DT Ordinary Shares. No fraction of a DT Depositary Share or a DT
Ordinary Share will be issued to holders of Powertel Stock, but each holder
of Powertel Stock otherwise entitled to receive a fraction of a DT Depositary
Share or DT Ordinary Share will be entitled to receive in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 1.09 from the Escrow Agent a cash payment in lieu
of such fraction of a DT Depositary Share or DT Ordinary Share, as applicable
(each a "FRACTIONAL INTEREST") representing such holder\'s proportionate
interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the Escrow Agent on behalf of
all such holders of the aggregate of the fractions of DT Depositary Shares
and DT Ordinary Shares which would otherwise be issued ("EXCESS ADSS" and
"EXCESS SHARES", respectively). The sale of the Excess ADSs and the Excess
Shares by the Escrow Agent shall be executed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (the "NYSE") and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (the "FSE"), respectively,
through one or more member firms of the NYSE or the FSE, as the case may be,
and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until
the     9  18  net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed
to the holders of Powertel Stock otherwise entitled to receive Fractional
Interests, the Escrow Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such holders
of Powertel Stock (the "POWERTEL STOCK TRUST"). DT shall pay all commissions,
transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the
expenses and compensation, of the Escrow Agent incurred in connection with
such sale of the Excess ADSs and Excess Shares. The Escrow Agent shall
determine the portion of the Powertel Stock Trust to which each holder of
Powertel Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the
aggregate net proceeds comprising the Powertel Stock Trust by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of Fractional Interests to which such holder
of Powertel Stock is entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate
amount of Fractional Interests to which all holders of Powertel Stock are
entitled. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Powertel Stock in lieu of
any Fractional Interests, the Escrow Agent shall make available such amounts
to such holders of Powertel Stock without interest.   SECTION 1.10. The
Surviving Corporation. (a) The certificate of incorporation of Powertel in
effect at the Effective Time as amended and restated to be identical to the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
applicable law, except that Article 1 thereof shall be amended to read: "The
name of the Corporation is Powertel Inc."   (b) The bylaws of Merger Sub in
effect at the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until amended in accordance with applicable law.   (c) The directors of
Merger Sub and the officers of Powertel immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation,
respectively, and such individuals shall serve in such positions until their
successors shall have been duly elected and shall qualify.   SECTION 1.11.
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holder\'s compliance with the
replacement requirements established by the Escrow Agent, including, if
necessary, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Escrow Agent will issue (or cause to be issued) in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and
any cash payable in lieu of Fractional Interests and any unpaid dividends or
other distributions deliverable pursuant to Section 1.06(f) in respect of the
Powertel Stock represented by such Certificate pursuant to this
Agreement.   ARTICLE 2   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF POWERTEL  
Except as disclosed in Powertel Filed SEC Documents (as defined below) and
except as set forth in the Powertel disclosure schedules attached to
this Agreement (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in the schedules
shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any section of this Agreement to
which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), Powertel hereby
represents and warrants as of the date hereof to DT as follows:     10 
19   SECTION 2.01. Organization. Each of Powertel and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "POWERTEL SUBSIDIARIES") is a corporation or
limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and is in good
standing (where such concept is applicable) under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has the requisite power
and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where
the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such
power and authority could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Powertel or prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the Merger. Powertel and each of the Powertel Subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is
applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Powertel or prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the Merger. Powertel has delivered to DT complete and
correct copies of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Powertel and
Restated By-laws of Powertel and has made available to DT the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (or similar organizational documents) of each of
the Powertel Subsidiaries.   SECTION 2.02. Subsidiaries. SCHEDULE 2.02 lists
each Powertel Subsidiary and any Investment Entity. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of each Powertel Subsidiary that is a corporation
have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of each Powertel Subsidiary are owned by
Powertel or by another Powertel Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens,
except for Liens which are granted to secure indebtedness and are disclosed
in SCHEDULE 2.02. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.02, (i) Powertel and the
Powertel Subsidiaries have no material ongoing obligations, agreements,
commitments, rights, understandings or arrangements with respect to any
Investment Entities, including funding obligations; and (ii) all Investment
Interests are owned by Powertel or the Powertel Subsidiaries free and clear
of all Liens. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.02 and except for the capital
stock owned by Powertel, directly or indirectly, in the Powertel
Subsidiaries, neither Powertel nor any of the Powertel Subsidiaries owns,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other ownership interest in any
corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other
entity.   SECTION 2.03. Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock
of Powertel consists of 401,000,000 shares of capital stock of which
400,000,000 shares are authorized to be issued as Powertel Common Stock and
1,000,000 shares are authorized to be issued as Powertel Preferred Stock. As

of restricted stock issued under the Restricted Stock Plan). The series of
Powertel Preferred Stock and the number of designated, issued and outstanding
shares, the current exchange ratio and the number of shares of Powertel
Common Stock issuable upon conversion as of the close of business on August
18, 2000 were as follows:     11  20     DESIGNATED,  ISSUED AND

adjustments set forth in the related Certificate  of Designations.  (2)
50,000 shares initially designated as Series C Preferred Shares have  been
converted to Powertel Common Stock.  (3) The Series E Preferred Shares and
Series F Preferred Shares bear  cumulative dividends that accrue on a daily
basis at an annual rate of  6.5% of the initial purchase price of such
shares.   The Series A, B, C, D, E, and F Preferred Shares are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "POWERTEL PREFERRED STOCK" and,

Common Stock are reserved for accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series E
Preferred Shares and Series F Preferred Shares. SCHEDULE 2.03 sets forth a
complete and accurate schedule of all Powertel Stock Options and
their respective shares, vesting schedules, exercise prices and expiration
dates that are     12  21  outstanding on the date hereof (provided,
that with respect to Powertel employees below the director level, such list
need only set forth the aggregate number of options with the weighted average
exercise prices at which grants have been made and need not specify grants by
grantee). Except as set forth above and in SCHEDULES 2.02 and 2.03, as of the
date hereof, no shares of Powertel Stock or shares of capital stock of any
Powertel Subsidiary were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding and
there are no stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other
contractual rights the value of which is determined in whole or in part by
the value of any capital stock ("POWERTEL STOCK RIGHTS") of Powertel or any
Powertel Subsidiary. The Powertel Preferred Stock, the Powertel Stock
Options, the Powertel Warrants, the Eliska Put Rights, the Powertel
Stock Rights and any other security convertible into, or exercisable or
exchangeable for, Powertel Common Stock (each of which shall be determined on
an as-if-converted, exercised or exchanged basis) are herein referred to
as "POWERTEL COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS." Each outstanding share of Powertel
Stock is, and each share of Powertel Stock which may be issued pursuant to
the Powertel Benefit Plans and the other agreements and instruments listed
above will be, when issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. There are no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Powertel or any
Powertel Subsidiary having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matter on which
Powertel\'s stockholders may vote. Except as set forth above or in SCHEDULE
2.02 OR SCHEDULE 2.03, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no
securities, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments, agreements,
arrangements or undertakings of any kind obligating Powertel or any of the
Powertel Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell or create, or cause to be
issued, delivered or sold or created, additional shares of capital stock or
other voting securities or Powertel Common Stock Equivalents or stock
equivalents of any of the Powertel Subsidiaries or obligating Powertel or any
of the Powertel Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such
security, option, warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, arrangement or
undertaking.   Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.02 OR SCHEDULE 2.03, as of
the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding contractual obligations
of Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of Powertel or any of the
Powertel Subsidiaries.   Between August 18, 2000 and the date of this
Agreement, no Powertel Common Stock or Powertel Common Stock Equivalents have
been issued or granted, except issuances of Powertel Common Stock upon the
exercise of Powertel Stock Options or Powertel Warrants outstanding on August
18, 2000, and grants of new Powertel Stock Options to new employees or
employees granted promotion in the ordinary course of business, provided that
such shares of Powertel Common Stock underlying such new Powertel Stock
Options will not exceed 50,000 shares.   SECTION 2.04. Authority. The Board
of Directors of Powertel, at a meeting duly called and held, duly adopted
resolutions (i) approving this Agreement, the Merger and the Powertel
Stockholder Agreements, (ii) determining that the Merger is fair to and in
the best interests of Powertel\'s stockholders and (iii) recommending that
Powertel\'s stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement. Powertel has
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and the other agreements to which it is a party that are referenced herein
and, subject to the adoption and approval of this Agreement by (i) a majority
of the votes entitled     13  22  to be cast by the holders of all
outstanding shares of Powertel Common Stock and Series A Preferred Shares,
voting on an as-if-converted to Powertel Common Stock basis and voting
together with the holders of Powertel Common Stock as a single class, and
(ii) two-thirds of each class of the Series A Preferred Shares, Series B
Preferred Shares, Series D Preferred Shares, Series E Preferred Shares and
Series F Preferred Shares, each such class of preferred stock voting as
a single class (collectively, the "POWERTEL STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"), to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Powertel and the consummation by Powertel of
the Merger and of the other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Powertel, subject
to the Powertel Stockholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by Powertel and (assuming the valid authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement by DT ) constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Powertel enforceable against Powertel in accordance with its
terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting or
relating to the enforcement of creditors\' rights and remedies generally, and
(ii) is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).   SECTION 2.05. No
Conflict; Required Filings and Consents. (a) Except as set forth in
subsection (b) below or as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.05, neither the execution,
delivery or performance (assuming such performance occurred on the date
hereof) of this Agreement by Powertel nor the consummation by Powertel of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (i) violate or conflict with
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Restated By-laws of Powertel or
of the similar organizational documents of any of the Powertel Subsidiaries,
(ii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due
notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
lease, license, contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
which Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries is a party or by which any
of their properties are bound, (iii) violate any law, court order, judgment,
decree or regulation applicable to Powertel or any of the Powertel
Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective properties are bound, or
(iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of
Powertel or the Powertel Subsidiaries, except in the case of clauses (ii),
(iii) or (iv) for violations, breaches or defaults that could not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Powertel or prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger.   (b) Except for filings,

with, or permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority (except where the failure to obtain such permit,
authorization, consent or      14  23 approval or to make such filings

capital stock or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any
other securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of
its capital stock, or (iv) any change in accounting methods, principles or
practices by Powertel affecting its assets, liabilities or business, except

Powertel Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, charters, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
or Regulatory Authority necessary for Powertel or any of the Powertel
Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties or to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted (the "POWERTEL PERMITS"), except where
the failure to have any of the Powertel Permits could not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Powertel, and, as of the
date of this Agreement, no suspension or cancellation of any of the Powertel
Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of Powertel, threatened, except where
the suspension or cancellation of any of the Powertel Permits could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Powertel. The business of Powertel and the Powertel
Subsidiaries is not being conducted in violation of any applicable law,
ordinance regulation, judgement, order or decree of any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority ("LEGAL REQUIREMENTS"), except for possible violations
that could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Powertel or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger. None
of the representations made in this Section 2.09 are being made with respect
to Environmental Laws.   (b) Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.09:   (i)
Powertel and each of the Powertel Subsidiaries holds, and is  qualified and
eligible to hold, all material licenses, permits and other  authorizations
issued or to be     16  25   issued by the FCC to such entity for the
operation of their respective  businesses, all of which are set forth in
SCHEDULE 2.09(B)(I) (the  "POWERTEL FCC LICENSES"). Each of the Powertel FCC
Licenses that is subject  to restrictions under Section 310(b) of the
Communications Act is held by a  Powertel Subsidiary.   (ii) The Powertel
FCC Licenses are valid and in full force and effect,  and neither Powertel
nor any of the Powertel Subsidiaries is or has been  delinquent in payment on
or in default under any installment obligation  owed to the United States
Treasury in connection with the Powertel FCC  Licenses. As used herein, the
term "full force and effect" means that (A)  the orders issuing the Powertel
FCC Licenses have become effective, (B) no  stay of effectiveness of such
orders has been issued by the FCC, and (C)  the Powertel FCC Licenses have
not been invalidated by any subsequent  published FCC action.   (iii) All
material reports and applications required by the  Communications Act or
required to be filed with the FCC by Powertel or any  of the Powertel

in  compliance in all material respects with, and the wireless
communications  systems operated pursuant to the Powertel FCC Licenses are
and have been  operated in compliance in all material respects with, the
Communications  Act.   (v) There is not pending or, to Powertel\'s
Knowledge, threatened as of  the date hereof any application, petition,
objection, pleading or  proceeding with the FCC or any public service
commission or similar body  having jurisdiction or authority over the
communications operations of  Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries
which is reasonably likely to  result in the revocation, cancellation,
suspension, dismissal, denial or  any materially adverse modification of any
Powertel FCC License or  imposition of any substantial fine or forfeiture
against Powertel or any of  the Powertel Subsidiaries.   (vi) No facts are
known to Powertel or the Powertel Subsidiaries which  if known by a
Governmental or Regulatory Authority of competent  jurisdiction would present
a substantial risk that any Powertel FCC License  could be revoked,
cancelled, suspended or materially adversely modified or  that any
substantial fine or forfeiture could be imposed against Powertel  or any of
the Powertel Subsidiaries.   (vii) Powertel and the Powertel Subsidiaries
have not made any material  misstatements of fact, or omitted to disclose any
fact, to any Government  Entity or in any report, document or certificate
filed therewith, which  misstatements or omissions, individually or in the
aggregate, could  reasonably be expected to subject any material Powertel FCC
Licenses to  revocation or failure to renew, except to the extent that such
revocation  or failure to renew would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Powertel or  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION
2.10. Tax Matters. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.10 or as would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on Powertel: (i) Powertel and each of the Powertel
Subsidiaries have timely filed (after taking into account any extensions to

are correct in all respects and accurately disclose in all respects all Taxes
required to be paid for the periods covered thereby; (iii) Powertel and the
Powertel Subsidiaries have paid or caused to be paid all Taxes shown as due
on such Tax Returns and all Taxes for which no Tax Return was required to be
filed, and the financial statements contained in the Powertel SEC Documents
reflect an adequate reserve as determined in accordance with GAAP for all
material Taxes payable by Powertel and the Powertel Subsidiaries and not yet
due (other than a reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax treatment) for all taxable periods and
portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial statements; (iv)
none of Powertel or any Powertel Subsidiary has waived in writing any statute
of limitations in respect of Taxes; (v) there is no action, suit,
investigation, audit, claim or assessment that has been formally commenced or
proposed to Powertel in writing with respect to Taxes of Powertel or any of
the Powertel Subsidiaries where an adverse determination is reasonably
likely; (vi) there are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of Powertel or any

been a member of any group of corporations filing Tax Returns on a

of which it is currently a member; (ix) no deduction of any amount that would
otherwise be deductible by Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries with
respect to taxable periods ending on or before the Effective Time could be
disallowed under Section 162(m) of the Code; (x) neither Powertel nor any of
the Powertel Subsidiaries has constituted either a "distributing corporation"
or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-
free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (a) in the two years prior to

constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger; (xi)
neither Powertel nor any of the Powertel Subsidiaries is a "United States
real property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of
the Code; (xii) neither Powertel nor DT will be obligated to make a payment,
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder or otherwise, to
any employee or former employee of, or individual providing services to,
Powertel or Powertel Subsidiaries that would be a "parachute payment" to a
"disqualified individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the
Code without regard to whether such payment is reasonable compensation for
personal services performed or to be performed in the future; and (xiii) none
of Powertel, the Powertel Subsidiaries or DT will be obligated to pay any
excise taxes or similar taxes imposed on any employee or former employee of,
or individual providing services to, Powertel or the Powertel Subsidiaries

(i) liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business
since December 31, 1999 or (ii) liabilities arising after December 31, 1999
which could     18  27  not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Powertel.  
SECTION 2.12. Benefit Plans; Employees and Employment Practices.   (a)
Except as disclosed in the Powertel Filed SEC Documents or SCHEDULE 2.12(A)
or to the extent required by law or required to maintain in compliance with
provisions of the Code, neither Powertel nor any of the Powertel Subsidiaries
has adopted or amended in any material respect any ERISA Benefit Plan since
the date of the most recent audited financial statements included in the
Powertel Filed SEC Documents. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE
2.12(A), Powertel does not have any commitment to create, adopt or contribute
to any Powertel Benefit Plan. Except as disclosed in SCHEDULE 2.12(A) or in
the Powertel Filed SEC Documents, as of the date of this Agreement, there
exist no material employment, consulting, severance, bonus, incentive or
termination agreements between Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries
and any current or former employee, officer or director of Powertel or any of
the Powertel Subsidiaries.   (b) SCHEDULE 2.12(B) contains a list of all
the material Powertel Benefit Plans. None of Powertel, any of the Powertel
Subsidiaries, any officer of Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries or
any of the ERISA Benefit Plans has on or before the date of this Agreement
engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any ERISA Benefit Plan that could
reasonably be expected to subject Powertel, any of the Powertel Subsidiaries
or any officer of Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries to any Tax on
prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or to any
liability under Section 502(i) or (l) of ERISA where such Tax or liability
has or would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Powertel. No ERISA Benefit Plan has incurred any "accumulated funding
deficiency" (as defined in Section 412 of the Code or Part 3 of Title I or
ERISA), whether or not waived. Neither Powertel nor any of the Powertel
Subsidiaries has incurred and none of such entities reasonably expects to
incur, any material liability to the PBGC with respect to any ERISA
Benefit Plan. No assets of Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries are
subject to liens arising under ERISA or the Code on account of any ERISA
Benefit Plan, neither Powertel nor any of the Powertel Subsidiaries has been
required to provide any security under Sections 401(a)(29) or 412(f) of the
Code, or under Section 307 of ERISA, and, to Powertel\'s Knowledge, no event
has occurred that could give rise to any such lien or a requirement to
provide any such security. Except as disclosed in SCHEDULE 2.12(B), none of
Powertel, the Powertel Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has at any time
during the five-year period preceding the date hereof contributed to any
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA).   (c) Except
as disclosed in SCHEDULE 2.12(C), and except for such matters as could not be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Powertel, to the
extent applicable, (i) each ERISA Benefit Plan complies with the requirements
of ERISA and the Code, (ii) each ERISA Benefit Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue
Service to be so qualified and nothing has occurred since the date of that
determination that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of such plan and its related trust is tax-exempt and
has been so since its creation, and (iii) each Powertel Benefit Plan has
been maintained, administered and operated in compliance with its terms and
with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules
and     19  28 regulations, including but not limited to ERISA and the
Code, which are applicable to such Powertel Benefit Plans.   (d) Except as
disclosed in SCHEDULE 2.12(D), all material contributions, reserves or
premium payments under or to Powertel Benefit Plans, accrued to the date
hereof have been made or provided for.   (e) Except as disclosed in SCHEDULE
2.12(E), and except for any liability as could not be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Powertel, Powertel has not incurred any
liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA with respect to any
"single-employer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA,
currently or formerly maintained by Powertel, or any entity which is
considered one employer with Powertel under Section 4001 of ERISA.   (f)
Except as disclosed in SCHEDULE 2.12(F) neither Powertel nor any of the
Powertel Subsidiaries has any obligation to provide retiree health or welfare
benefits for any current or former employee under any Powertel Benefit Plan,
except as required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or to avoid excise
taxes under Section 4980B of the Code, and the terms of Powertel Benefit
Plans permit Powertel to amend or terminate such Powertel Benefit Plans at
any time without incurring liability thereunder.   (g) Except as disclosed
in SCHEDULE 2.12 (G), Powertel has not engaged in, nor is it a successor or
parent corporation to an entity that has engaged in a transaction described
in Section 4069 of ERISA.   (h) Except as disclosed in SCHEDULE 2.12(H), the
consummation or announcement of any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
further acts or events) result in any (i) payment (whether of severance pay
or otherwise) becoming due from Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries
to any officer, employee, former employee or director thereof or to the
trustee under any "rabbi trust" or similar arrangement; (ii) benefit under
any Powertel Benefit Plan being established or becoming accelerated, vested
or payable; or (iii) "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA)
with respect to any ERISA Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.   (i)
Except as disclosed in SCHEDULE 2.12(I), as of the date of this Agreement
there are no pending disputes, arbitrations, claims, suits, grievances or, to
the Knowledge of Powertel, governmental audits involving a Powertel Benefit
Plan (other than routine claims for benefits payable under any such Powertel
Benefit Plan or routine audits) that would reasonably be expected either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Powertel.   (j) SCHEDULE 2.12(J) contains a list setting forth the name
and current annual salary and other material compensation payable to each
Significant Employee, and the profit sharing, bonus or other form of
additional cash compensation paid or payable by Powertel or the Powertel

contracts, agreements or arrangements obligating Powertel or any of the
Powertel Subsidiaries to increase the compensation or benefits presently

employment matters) for injury, sickness, disease, discrimination, death or
termination of employment of any Significant Employee, or other employment

compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations
respecting employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of

from a financial point of view.   SECTION 2.18. Brokers. Except for the
Powertel Financial Advisor, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by
Powertel (and are reflected in agreements with Powertel, a true and correct
copy of which has been furnished to, and accepted by, DT), no broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other person, is entitled to any
broker\'s, finder\'s, financial advisor\'s or other similar fee or commission
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Powertel. In no event shall the amounts
paid or payable by Powertel to the Powertel Financial Advisor in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exceed $28,000,000.  
SECTION 2.19. Tax Status. To the Knowledge of Powertel after
due investigation, neither Powertel nor any of its Affiliates has taken any
action or failed to take any action which action or failure would (i)
jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) cause the stockholders of
Powertel, other than any such stockholder that would be a "five-percent
transferee shareholder" of DT (within the meaning of U.S. Treasury
Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)) following the Merger, to recognize gain
pursuant to Section 367(a) of the Code. To the Knowledge of Powertel after
due investigation, there are no facts or circumstances relating to Powertel
or its Affiliates, including any covenants or undertakings of Powertel
pursuant to this Agreement, that     23  32  would prevent Morris,
Manning and Martin, LLP from delivering the opinion referred to in Section
6.02(d) as of the date hereof.   SECTION 2.20. Contracts. Except as set
forth in the Powertel Filed SEC Documents or in SCHEDULE 2.20, and except for
this Agreement, the Alternative Merger Agreement and the agreements
referenced hereby and thereby, neither Powertel nor any of the Powertel
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by (i) any "material contract" (as such
term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC) or any
agreement, contract or commitment the loss or termination of which could have
a Material Adverse Effect on Powertel; (ii) any non-competition agreement or
any similar agreement or obligation which materially limits or could
materially limit Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries from engaging
in the business of providing wireless communications services or from
developing wireless communications technology anywhere in the world or (iii)
any management agreement, technical services agreement or other agreement
whereby Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries is providing or is
required to provide management or technical services to any other
Person. Taken as a whole, the contracts and agreements required to be filed
by Powertel with the SEC together with the contracts and agreements required
to be set forth on SCHEDULE 2.20 are collectively referred to as the
"POWERTEL CONTRACTS". With such exceptions as, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had, and could not be reasonably expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on Powertel, (x) each of the Powertel Contracts is
valid and in full force and effect (except to the extent they have previously
expired with no residual obligation in accordance with their terms), and (y)
except as set forth in SCHEDULE 2.20, neither Powertel nor any of the
Powertel Subsidiaries has violated any provision of, or committed or failed
to perform any act which, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a default under the provisions of any such Powertel
Contract. To the knowledge of Powertel, no counterparty to any such Powertel
Contract has violated any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any
act which, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both would constitute a
default or other breach under the provisions of, such Powertel Contract,
except for defaults or breaches which, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect on Powertel. Neither Powertel nor any of the Powertel Subsidiaries is
a party to, or otherwise a guarantor of or liable with respect to, any
interest rate, currency or other swap or derivative transaction, other than
any such transactions which are not material to the business of Powertel
or the Powertel Subsidiaries. Powertel has provided or made available to DT a
copy of each agreement described in item (i), (ii) and (iii) above. The
designation or definition of Powertel Contracts for purposes of this SECTION
2.20 and the disclosures made pursuant hereto shall not be construed or
utilized to expand, limit or define the terms "material" and "Material
Adverse Effect" as otherwise referenced and used in this Agreement.  
SECTION 2.21. Vote Required. The only vote of the holders of any class or
series of capital stock of Powertel necessary to approve this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby is the Powertel Stockholder
Approval. As of the date hereof, the Powertel Principal Stockholders have the
requisite voting power to satisfy the Powertel Stockholder Approval.  
SECTION 2.22. Transactions with Affiliates. Except as described in SCHEDULE
2.22 or in the Powertel Filed SEC Documents, to Powertel\'s Knowledge, no
director or executive officer of Powertel or any 5% or greater stockholder
of Powertel is at the date hereof a     24  33  party to any
transaction with Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries in which the
amount involved exceeds $60,000, including any contract or
arrangement providing for the furnishing of services to or by, providing for
rental of real or personal property (including intellectual property) to or
from, or otherwise requiring payments to or from Powertel or any of the
Powertel Subsidiaries.   ARTICLE 3   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
DT   Except as disclosed in the DT Filed SEC Documents and except as
set forth in the DT disclosure schedules attached to this Agreement (it being

and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its

have a Material Adverse Effect on DT or materially delay the consummation of
the Merger.   SECTION 3.02. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. DT is
an Aktiengesellschaft organized and existing under the laws of the Federal
Republic of Germany. DT has heretofore furnished, or otherwise made

of any character (contingent or otherwise) to purchase or otherwise acquire
from DT or any of DT\'s Significant Subsidiaries at any time, or upon the
happening of any stated event, any shares of the capital stock or other
voting or non-voting securities of DT.   (b) All of the issued and

nonassessable. All DT Depositary Shares and DT Ordinary Shares to be issued
as Merger Consideration will be, when issued, validly issued, fully paid and

there are no outstanding obligations of DT or any of DT\'s Significant
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital
stock or other voting or non-voting securities of any of DT\'s Subsidiaries,
other than such as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on DT.   SECTION 3.04. Authority. DT has the
necessary corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and the
Powertel Stockholder Agreements and to carry out its obligations hereunder
and thereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Stockholders Agreement by DT and the consummation by DT of the transactions

encumbrance on any of the properties or assets of DT or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries pursuant to, or result in the loss of any material
benefit or right, including the benefit of any standstill agreement, or
result in an acceleration of any rights or amounts due resulting from a
change of control or otherwise, or require the consent of any other party to,
any contract, instrument, DT Permit, license or franchise to which DT or any
of its Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which DT or any of such
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective property is bound or affected,
except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, for conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults, rights, results or consents which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
DT or materially delay the consummation of the Merger.   (b) Except for

performance of this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement. Except as set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence, no waiver, consent, approval or

Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 and
(ii) all other reports or registration statements filed by DT with the SEC
since January 1, 1999 (collectively, the "DT SEC DOCUMENTS"). The DT SEC
Documents (i) were prepared substantially in accordance with the requirements
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations promulgated under each of such respective acts and (ii) did
not at the time they were filed contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.     27  36  
(b) The financial statements (the "DT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"), including all
related notes and schedules, contained in the DT SEC Documents
(or incorporated by reference therein) fairly present the consolidated
financial position of DT and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates
thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of DT and

subject in the case of interim financial statements to normal year-end
adjustments.   SECTION 3.07. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as

FILED SEC DOCUMENTS"), (a) since December 31, 1999, there has not been any
Material Adverse Effect on DT, and (b) DT and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, have not incurred since December 31, 1999 any material liabilities or

course of business and consistent with past practices, (ii) liabilities or
obligations which have been discharged or paid in full prior to the date

there are no claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending
or, to DT\'s Knowledge, threatened against DT or any of its Subsidiaries, or
any properties or rights of DT or any of its Subsidiaries, before any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority that would reasonably be expected to
result in an adverse judgment or determination against DT or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for those that are not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on DT or
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger except as set
forth on SCHEDULE 3.08 hereof.   SECTION 3.09. No Violation of Law. The
business of DT and its Subsidiaries is not being conducted in violation of
any Legal Requirements or in violation of any DT Permits, except for possible
violations none of which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on DT or prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Merger. Except as disclosed in DT SEC Documents
filed prior to the date hereof and as set forth on SCHEDULE 3.09 hereto, as
of the date hereof, no investigation, review or proceeding by any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority (including, without limitation, any
stock exchange or other self-regulatory body) with respect to DT or its
Subsidiaries in relation to any alleged violation of law or regulation is
pending or, to DT\'s Knowledge, threatened, nor has any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority (including, without limitation, any stock exchange or
other self-regulatory body) indicated in writing an intention to conduct the
same, except for such investigations which, if they resulted in adverse
findings, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on DT.   SECTION 3.10. Information
Provided by DT. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on
behalf of DT for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the     28 
37  Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement

circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None of the

material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of DT for inclusion or incorporation by reference in

contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.   SECTION 3.11. Board Action; Vote Required. (a) The Management
Board (VORSTAND) and the Supervisory Board (AUFSICHTSRAT) of DT have
determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Stockholders Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of DT and its
shareholders.   (b) No vote of holders of any class or series of DT capital
stock, including, without limitation, holders of DT Ordinary Shares or DT

Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 3.13 and except to the extent that the
failure of the following representations to be true, whether considered
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
DT:   (a) All Tax Returns required to be filed by DT or its Subsidiaries
on or prior to the Effective Time have been or will be timely filed with
the appropriate Governmental or Regulatory Authorities and are or will be
correct in all respects, and all Taxes due by DT or its Subsidiaries on or

assessment of any Taxes has been granted by DT or any of its Subsidiaries and
is currently in effect;   (e) Neither DT nor any of its Subsidiaries has
taken any action or knows of any fact that is reasonably likely to (i)
prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) cause the stockholders of
Powertel, other than any such stockholder that would be a "five-percent
transferee shareholder" of DT (within the meaning of U.S. Treasury
Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)) following the Merger, to recognize gain
pursuant to Section 367(a) of the Code; and   (f) The assets of DT do not

agreement, arrangement or understanding for the purpose of acquiring,
holding, voting or disposing of, in each case, shares of capital stock of
Powertel (other than shares held by DT Benefit Plans). Except as set forth on

and, to DT\'s Knowledge, there is not threatened, any action by or before any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority to revoke, suspend, cancel, rescind or
modify in any material respect any of the DT Licenses which action would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on DT.   ARTICLE

Conduct of Business by DT. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.02 hereto or as
otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, DT agrees on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries that they will not, between the date hereof and
the Effective Time, directly or indirectly, do any of the following without

required for the purpose of using or increasing any or all of DT\'s

(GESCHAFTSORDNUNG) (or other comparable organizational document) of DT in any

the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that this Section
4.02(c) shall not preclude any acquisitions by DT or any of its Subsidiaries
so long as such acquisitions, individually or in the aggregate, are not
reasonably likely to prevent the consummation of the Merger.   SECTION
4.03. No Solicitation. (a) From and after the date hereof until the earlier
of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, Powertel shall
not, nor shall it permit any of the Powertel Subsidiaries to, nor shall they
authorize or instruct any of their respective officers, directors
or employees to, and shall use their reasonable efforts to cause any
investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountants or other
representatives retained by them or any of their respective Subsidiaries not
to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information), or
knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any Alternative
Transaction (as defined     34  43  below), or (ii) continue or
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Alternative
Transaction; provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the time that
the Powertel Stockholders\' Approval is obtained, the Board of Directors of
Powertel receives an unsolicited bona fide proposal and determines in good
faith and after the receipt of advice from outside counsel that providing
information to the Third Party (as defined below), making such proposal or
participating in negotiations or discussions with the Third Party
is reasonably expected to result in a Powertel Superior Proposal (as defined
below) and if Powertel has fully and completely complied with its obligations
under this Section 4.03, Powertel may, subject to giving DT three Business
Days\' advance written notice of its intention to do so and obtaining a
confidentiality agreement from the Third Party substantially similar to the
Confidentiality Agreement between Powertel and DT dated as of August 16, 2000
(the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), (x) furnish information to such Third
Party with respect to Powertel and the Powertel Subsidiaries and (y) engage
in discussions and negotiations regarding such proposal.   (b) Powertel
will notify DT promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt
by Powertel (or any of its advisors) of any Alternative Transaction, or of
any request (other than in the ordinary course of business and not related to
an Alternative Transaction) for non-public information relating to Powertel
or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or
records of Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries by any Person who is
known to be considering making, or has made, an Alternative Transaction.
Powertel shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify
the Person making, and the terms and conditions of, any such Alternative
Transaction or request. Powertel shall keep DT fully informed, on a prompt
basis (but in any event no later than 24 hours), of the status and details of
any such Alternative Transaction or request. Powertel shall, and shall cause
the Powertel Subsidiaries and the directors, employees and other agents of
Powertel and the Powertel Subsidiaries to cease immediately and cause to be
terminated all activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with
any Persons conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Alternative Transaction.   (c) Powertel (i) agrees not to release any Third
Party from, or waive any provision of, or fail to enforce, any standstill
agreement or similar agreement to which it is a party related to, or which
could affect, an Alternative Transaction and agrees that DT shall be entitled
to enforce Powertel\'s rights and remedies under and in connection with such
agreements, and (ii) acknowledges that the provisions of clause (i) are an
important and integral part of this Agreement. Nothing contained in this
Section 4.03 or in Section 5.02 shall prohibit Powertel (x) from complying
with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (y)
from making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment
of the Board of Directors of Powertel, after receipt of advice from outside
counsel, failure to disclose would result in a reasonable likelihood that the
Board of Directors of Powertel would breach its duties to Powertel\'s
stockholders under Delaware Law.   For purposes of this Agreement,
"ALTERNATIVE TRANSACTION" means a proposal or intended proposal, regarding
any of (i) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any
Person (or "group" of Persons) other than a Party and its Subsidiaries (a
"THIRD PARTY") acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, "beneficial
ownership" (as such terms are defined in or interpreted for purposes of Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of more than twenty percent (20%) of the voting
power of the outstanding capital stock of Powertel or     35 
44  pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) any
acquisition or proposed acquisition of, or business combination with Powertel
or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries, as applicable, by a merger or other
business combination (including any so-called "merger-of-equals" and whether
or not Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries, as the case may be, is
the entity surviving any such merger or business combination) or (iii) any
other transaction pursuant to which any Third Party acquires or would
acquire, directly or indirectly, control of assets (including for this
purpose the outstanding equity securities of the Powertel Subsidiaries and
any entity surviving the merger or business combination including any of
them) of Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
for consideration equal to twenty percent (20%) or more of the fair market
value of all of the outstanding shares of Powertel capital stock on the date
of this Agreement; provided, that for purposes of this Agreement the term
"Alternative Transaction" does not include the proposed acquisition of
Powertel by VoiceStream as contemplated by the Alternative Merger
Agreement.   SECTION 4.04. Subsequent Financial Statements. Powertel, prior
to the Effective Time, will timely file with the SEC each Annual Report on
Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Current Report on Form 8-K
required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder and will promptly deliver to DT copies of
each such report filed with the SEC. DT will timely file with the SEC each
Annual Report on Form 20-F and Report on Form 6-K required to be filed by it
under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
and will promptly deliver to Powertel copies of each such report filed with
the SEC. As of their respective dates, none of such reports shall contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The respective
audited financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements of
each of Powertel and DT, as the case may be, included in such reports will
fairly present the financial position of such Party and its Subsidiaries as
at the dates thereof and the results of their operations and cash flows for
the periods then ended in accordance with GAAP (with a reconciliation to GAAP
in accordance with SEC rules in the case of Powertel) or generally accepted
accounting principles in Germany (in the case of DT) applied on a consistent
basis and, subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to
normal year-end adjustments and any other adjustments described therein.  
SECTION 4.05. Control of Operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to give DT, directly or indirectly, the right to "control" or
"direct", as such terms are construed under applicable rules or regulations
of the FCC, Powertel\'s operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, Powertel shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, "control" over its respective
operations.   SECTION 4.06. Alternative Merger Agreement. Powertel will not
modify, amend or waive in any material respect the provisions of the
Alternative Merger Agreement without DT\'s prior written consent.    
36  45   ARTICLE 5   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   SECTION 5.01. Powertel
Proxy Statement; the DT Registration Statement and the German Listing
Prospectus. (a) Each of DT and Powertel shall cooperate and promptly prepare
and DT shall file with the SEC as soon as practicable the DT Registration
Statement on Form F-4 (or any successor form) (the "FORM F-4") under the
Securities Act with respect to the DT Ordinary Shares and the DT Depositary
Shares issuable and deliverable pursuant to this Agreement. A portion of the
Form F-4 shall serve as a prospectus with respect to the DT Ordinary Shares
and the DT Depositary Shares issuable and deliverable pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement and as Powertel\'s proxy statement with respect to Powertel
Stockholders\' Meeting (the "POWERTEL PROXY STATEMENT"). DT will cause the
Form F-4 to comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, and Powertel will cause the Powertel Proxy Statement to comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Powertel and DT shall
use their reasonable best efforts to have the Powertel Proxy Statement and
the DT Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC under the
Securities Act, and promptly thereafter shall mail to the holders of record
of Powertel Common Shares the Powertel Proxy Statement; provided, however,
that Powertel shall not mail or otherwise furnish the Powertel Proxy
Statement to its stockholders unless and until:   (i) it has received oral
notice from the SEC that the DT Registration  Statement is effective under
the Securities Act;   (ii) Powertel shall have received a letter of its
independent  accountants, dated a date within two (2) business days prior to
the date of  the first mailing of the Powertel Proxy Statement, and addressed
to  Powertel, in form reasonably satisfactory to Powertel and customary in 
scope for similar "cold comfort" letters delivered by independent public 
accountants in connection with registration statements on Form F-4 with 
respect to the financial statements of DT included in the Powertel Proxy 
Statement and the DT Registration Statement;   (iii) DT shall have received
a letter of its independent accountants,  dated a date within two (2)
business days prior to the date of the first  mailing of the Powertel Proxy
Statement, and addressed to DT, in form  reasonably satisfactory to DT and
customary in scope for similar "cold  comfort" letters delivered by
independent public accountants in connection  with registration statements on
Form F-4 with respect to the financial  statements of Powertel included in
the Powertel Proxy Statement and the DT  Registration Statement.   DT shall
take any reasonable action (other than qualifying to do business in any
jurisdiction in which it is now not so qualified) to obtain prior to the
effective date of the Form F-4 all necessary state securities law or "Blue
Sky" permits and approvals or similar foreign approvals required to effect
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the distribution
of DT Depositary Shares and DT Ordinary Shares issued in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, and Powertel will provide any
reasonably requested cooperation in connection therewith. DT will advise
Powertel of the time when the Form F-4 has become     37 
46  effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of
any stop order or the suspension of the qualification of the DT Depositary
Shares or DT Ordinary Shares issuable and deliverable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction.   (b) DT and Powertel will
cooperate in (i) the preparation of the Powertel Proxy Statement and the DT
Registration Statement or any amendments and supplements thereto and in
having the DT Registration Statement declared effective as soon as
practicable and (ii) the preparation and filing of the German Listing
Prospectus with the FSE and the auditor\'s report with the Commercial
Register.   SECTION 5.02. Powertel Stockholders\' Meeting and Consummation
of the Merger.   (a) As promptly as practicable after the DT Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, Powertel shall duly
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "POWERTEL
STOCKHOLDERS\' MEETING") in accordance with Delaware Law for the purposes of
obtaining the Powertel Stockholder Approval and shall, subject to the
provisions of Section 5.02(b) hereof, through its Board of Directors,
recommend to its stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement and
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Powertel Stockholder
Approval.   (b) Neither the Board of Directors of Powertel nor any
committee thereof shall (i) except as expressly permitted by this Section
5.02(b), withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw,
qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to DT, the approval or recommendation
of such Board of Directors or such committee of this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Alternative Transaction, or
(iii) cause Powertel to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any
Alternative Transaction (each, a "POWERTEL ACQUISITION AGREEMENT").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that prior to the time the
Powertel Stockholder Approval is obtained, Powertel receives a Superior
Proposal (as defined below), the Board of Directors of Powertel may (subject
to this and the following sentences) inform Powertel stockholders that it no
longer recommends Powertel Stockholder Approval (a "SUBSEQUENT
DETERMINATION"), but only at a time that is after the fifth Business Day
following DT\'s receipt of written notice advising DT that the Board
of Directors of Powertel has received a Superior Proposal specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and including a copy
or draft copy thereof with all accompanying documentation or draft
documentation, if in writing), identifying the Person making such Superior
Proposal and stating that it intends to make a Subsequent Determination.
After providing such notice, Powertel shall provide a reasonable opportunity
to DT to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
as would enable Powertel to proceed with its recommendation to its
stockholders without a Subsequent Determination; provided, however, that any
such adjustment shall be at the discretion of Powertel and DT at the time.
For purposes of this Agreement, a "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means any proposal (on
its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by
a Third Party to enter into an Alternative Transaction which the Board of
Directors of Powertel determines in its good faith judgment (based on, among
other things, the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be more favorable to Powertel\'s stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement taking into account all relevant
factors (including whether, in     38  47  the good faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of Powertel, after obtaining the advice of a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, the Third Party is reasonably
able to finance the transaction, and any changes to this Agreement that may
be proposed by DT in response to such Alternative Transaction). Powertel
shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders at the Powertel
Stockholders\' Meeting even if the Board of Directors of Powertel shall have
made a Subsequent Determination.   Powertel shall use its reasonable best
efforts to schedule the Powertel Stockholders\' Meeting at the same time as
the Powertel Stockholders\' Meeting (as defined in the Alternative Merger
Agreement).   SECTION 5.03. Notification of Certain Matters. (a) Each of
Powertel and DT shall give prompt notice to each other of the following:  
(i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event whose occurrence or 
nonoccurrence would be likely to cause either (i) any representation or 
warranty contained in this Agreement of such Party to be untrue, inaccurate 
or incomplete in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to 
the Effective Time if such failure to be true, accurate or complete would 
cause the condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) or 6.03(a) not to be 
satisfied, in which case the Party required to give prompt notice thereof 
shall promptly update and deliver to the other Party any Schedules hereto 
which require an update to remain true, accurate and correct or (ii) 
directly or indirectly, any Material Adverse Effect on such Party;   (ii)
any material failure of such Party, or any officer, director,  employee or
agent of any thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant or  agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder (if such failure  would cause
the condition set forth in Section 6.02(b) or 6.03(b) not to be  satisfied);
and   (iii) any facts relating to such Party which would make it necessary
or  advisable to amend the Powertel Proxy Statement or the DT Registration 
Statement in order to make the statements therein not misleading or to 
comply with applicable law; provided, however, that the delivery of any 
notice pursuant to this Section 5.03 shall not limit or otherwise affect  the
remedies available hereunder to the Parties receiving such notice.   (iv)
Promptly upon receipt by Powertel from any Powertel stockholder  who is a
party to the Powertel Stockholder Agreements of a proxy card sent  to the
Powertel stockholders with the Powertel Proxy Statement and in  accordance
with Section 5 of the Stockholders Agreement, but in no event  later than the
second Business Day following such receipt or, if such  receipt is on or
after the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing, then on  the date of such
receipt, Powertel shall notify DT orally of its receipt  and provide DT with
copy of such proxy card.   (b) DT shall promptly provide to Powertel a copy
of any written notice given by DT to VoiceStream or received by DT from
VoiceStream of the termination of the VoiceStream Merger Agreement.    
39  48   SECTION 5.04. Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice and
subject to restrictions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and
other confidentiality agreements to which Powertel is subject, (a) Powertel
shall, and shall cause each Powertel Subsidiary to, afford to DT and to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of DT all
reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period prior to
the Effective Time, to all their respective lenders, agents and other
representatives, properties, assets, books, contracts, commitments and
records and, during such period, Powertel shall (and shall cause each
Powertel Subsidiary to) furnish promptly to DT all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as DT may reasonably request, including a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
the federal or state securities laws or the federal Tax laws and (b) DT
shall, and shall cause each DT Subsidiary to, afford to Powertel and to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of
Powertel all reasonable access, during normal business hours during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to all their respective properties,
assets, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such period, DT
shall (and shall cause each DT Subsidiary to) furnish promptly to Powertel
all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Powertel
may reasonably request, including a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state
securities laws.   SECTION 5.05. Public Announcements. DT and Powertel will
consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such
press release prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable law, fiduciary duties or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange. The parties will cooperate
in preparing a joint press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement.   SECTION 5.06. Cooperation. (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions hereof, each of Powertel and DT agrees, and agrees to
cooperate with each other, (i) to use reasonable best efforts to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) to obtain in a
timely manner all necessary Permits or waivers from, approvals or consents
of, or declarations, registrations or filings with, and all expirations of
waiting periods imposed by, any Governmental or Regulatory Authority which
are necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
(iii) to promptly (A) prepare and file a Premerger Notification in accordance
with the HSR Act, comply with any requests for additional information, and
obtain termination of the waiting period thereunder as promptly as
practicable, (B) prepare and file all required notifications, if any, under
Council Regulation (EEC) No. 4064/89, and obtain the approval of the Council
of the European Union to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if
required, and (C) file a notice pursuant to Section 721 of Exon-Florio, and
(iv) to take all actions within its control necessary to obtain any Required
Regulatory Approvals necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that neither DT nor any of its Subsidiaries shall
be required, nor, without the consent of DT, shall Powertel or its
Subsidiaries be permitted, to divest or hold separate or otherwise take or
commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to
Powertel, DT, VoiceStream or any of their Subsidiaries or any material
portion of the assets of Powertel, DT, VoiceStream or any of     40 
49  their Subsidiaries or any of the business, product lines, or assets of
Powertel, DT, VoiceStream or any of their Subsidiaries.   (b) Each of
Powertel and DT agrees to cooperate with each other (i) to respond to
inquiries from, and to make presentations to, Governmental or Regulatory
Authorities and (ii) to promptly inform the others of any material oral or
written communication received by such Party from, or given by such Party to,
any Governmental or Regulatory Authority, and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private Party, in
each case regarding the transactions between DT and Powertel contemplated by
this Agreement. Powertel and DT agree to consult with each other in advance
of any meeting or conference with, or of making any filing or other written
submission to, any such Governmental or Regulatory Authority, and to
the extent permitted by the applicable Governmental or Regulatory Authority,
give the others the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences, or to review and approve any such filing or other
written submission, in each case regarding the transactions between DT and
Powertel contemplated by this Agreement. Powertel shall promptly provide to
DT, upon request, and DT shall promptly provide to Powertel, upon request,
copies of all written communications referenced in Section 5.06(b)(i) above
and all filings made by DT or Powertel, as the case may be, with any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and written correspondence from any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority that relates to the transactions
contemplated hereby (excluding any exhibits, schedules and any confidential
information contained therein).   (c) Each of Powertel and DT shall
cooperate with each other to eliminate or reduce to the extent possible any
illegality, forfeiture or loss on the part of DT, Powertel or their
respective Subsidiaries that may result from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (d) Each of Powertel and DT hereby
agrees to cooperate with the other party, and to cause its officers,
directors and independent accountants to cooperate with the other party, to
do or cause to be done all things reasonably requested by the other party
(including, without limitation, providing such information as may reasonably

the Merger to be produced) in order to facilitate any financing, acquisition
or capital markets transaction or registration to be entered into or made by
either Party after the date hereof.   (e) Powertel hereby agrees to use
reasonable best efforts, in consultation with DT, to obtain all waivers and
consents that may be required from any parties to any Powertel Contract,

Powertel and its Subsidiaries, in connection with this Agreement, the
Powertel Stockholder Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.   (f) Powertel hereby agrees, from the date hereof until the
Closing, to take any and all actions that are required to be taken prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to any Powertel Contract or other agreement,
including, without limitation, any debt instruments, including credit

Subsidiaries is a party and to make any offer to purchase any securities
required to be made, as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Powertel Stockholder Agreements.     41  50   (g) DT
shall cause Merger Sub to approve, and shall vote all securities and give all
approvals necessary for Merger Sub to approve, the Merger.   (h)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
connection with any filing or submission required or action to be taken by
DT, Powertel or any of its respective Subsidiaries to consummate the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated in this Agreement, Powertel shall not,
without DT\'s prior written consent, commit to any divestiture of assets
of businesses of Powertel and its Subsidiaries if such divested assets
and/or businesses are material to the assets or profitability of Powertel and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.   SECTION 5.07. Indemnification,
Directors\' and Officers\' Insurance. (a) DT shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to provide, fulfill and honor all rights
to indemnification or exculpation existing in favor of a director, officer,
employee or agent (an "INDEMNIFIED PERSON") of Powertel or any of the
Powertel Subsidiaries (including rights relating to advancement of expenses
and indemnification rights to which such persons are entitled because they
are serving as a director, officer, agent or employee of another entity
at the request of Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries), as provided
in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Powertel, the Restated By-
laws of Powertel or any indemnification agreement, in each case, as in effect
on the date of this Agreement, and relating to actions or events through the
Effective Time, and such rights to indemnification shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect, without any amendment thereto;
provided, however, that neither DT nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to indemnify any Indemnified Person in connection with any
proceeding (or portion thereof) to the extent involving any claim initiated
by such Indemnified Person unless the initiation of such proceeding (or
portion thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of Powertel or
unless such proceeding is brought by an Indemnified Person to enforce rights
under this Section 5.07; provided further that any determination required to
be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Person\'s conduct complies
with the standards set forth under the Delaware Law, the Restated Certificate
of Incorporation of Powertel, the Restated By-laws of Powertel or any such
agreement, as the case may be, shall be made by independent legal counsel
selected by DT and reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person; provided
further that DT and the Surviving Corporation will cooperate and use all
reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter; and
provided further that that nothing in this Section 5.07 shall impair any
rights of any Indemnified Person. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, in the event that any Indemnified Person becomes involved
in any actual or threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation
after the Effective Time relating to actions prior to the Effective Time, DT
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly advance to such
Indemnified Person his or her legal and other expenses (including the cost of
any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject
to the providing by such Indemnified Person, to the extent required by law,
of an undertaking to reimburse all amounts so advanced in the event of a non-
appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled thereto.   (b) Subject to the prior
written approval by DT, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, prior to
the Effective Time, Powertel shall have the right to obtain and pay for in
full a "tail" coverage directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy
("DandO; INSURANCE") covering a     42  51  period of six years after the
Effective Time and providing coverage in amounts and on terms consistent with
Powertel\'s existing DandO; Insurance. In the event the Surviving Corporation
does not obtain such insurance, DT shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
continue to provide DandO; Insurance relating to actions or events through the
Effective Time, for a period of six years after the Effective Time; provided,
that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of
substantially similar coverage and amounts containing terms no
less advantageous to such former directors or officers; provided further that
if the existing DandO; Insurance expires or is cancelled during such period, DT
or the Surviving Corporation shall make reasonable commercial efforts to
obtain substantially similar DandO; Insurance; and provided further that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to expend, in order to maintain
or procure an annual DandO; Insurance policy, an amount in excess of 250% of
the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount.   (c) In the event
DT or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions, then, and in each such case, DT will make or cause to be made
proper provision so that the successors and assigns of DT or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the indemnification
obligations described herein for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties.  
(d) The provisions of this Section 5.07 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs
and his or her personal representatives and shall survive the Merger and be
binding upon the successors and assigns of DT, Powertel and the
Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 5.08. Stock Exchange
Listings/Establishment of DT Depositary Shares. DT will take all steps
necessary for the listing and authorization for listing on the FSE and the
NYSE (subject to official notice of issuance) of the DT Ordinary Shares and
the DT Depositary Shares, respectively, to be issued pursuant to the
Merger.   SECTION 5.09. No Shelf Registration. DT shall not be required to
amend or maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for the
purpose of permitting resale of the shares of DT received pursuant hereto by
the Persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Powertel within the
meaning of Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act. The DT Ordinary
Shares issuable upon exercise of options pursuant to Section 1.05 hereof
shall be registered under the Securities Act and such registration shall be
effective at the time of issuance.   SECTION 5.10. Affiliates. Powertel (i)
shall deliver to DT not later than the 30th day after the date of this
Agreement a list of all persons who are, as of the date hereof, its
Affiliates for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act and (ii) shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person who is identified as its
"affiliate" on SCHEDULE 5.10 to deliver to DT as promptly as practicable but
in no event later than the Closing Date, a signed agreement substantially in
the form of Exhibit A. Powertel shall notify DT from time to time of any
other persons who then are such an "affiliate" of Powertel and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each additional person who is identified as
such an "affiliate" to execute a signed agreement as set forth in this
Section 5.10.     43  52   SECTION 5.11. Tax-Free Merger. Each of the
Parties will use its reasonable best efforts, and each agrees to cooperate
with the other Parties and provide one another with such documentation,
information and materials as may be reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to (i) cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) avoid gain recognition to the
stockholders of Powertel pursuant to Section 367(a) of the Code.   SECTION
5.12. Reasonable Best Efforts. Each of Powertel and DT shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinions referred to in
Section 6.02(d), Section 6.02(e), 6.03(d) and 6.03(e) and the delivery of
the Representation Letters in the forms set forth in Exhibits B and C.  
SECTION 5.13. Takeover Laws. Subject to Section 5.02, no Party shall take any
action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Stockholders Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by
any Takeover Laws (including any such laws or regulations applicable to DT
under German Legal Requirements or the Legal Requirements of the FSE) and
each of them shall take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or
ensure the continued exemption of), or minimize the effect on, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement
from, or if necessary challenge the validity or applicability of, any
applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in effect, including, without
limitation, Section 203 of the Delaware Law or any other Takeover Laws that
purport to apply to this Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.   SECTION 5.14. Certain
Litigation. Powertel agrees that it shall not settle any litigation commenced
after the date hereof against Powertel or any of its directors by any
stockholder of Powertel relating to the Merger, this Agreement, the
Alternative Merger Agreement or the Stockholders Agreement without the prior
written consent of DT, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   SECTION 5.15. Senior Discount Notes and Senior Notes. Within 30
days following the Effective Time, DT shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to commence an offer to purchase all of the Senior Discount Notes and Senior
Notes (collectively, the "NOTES") pursuant to the terms of the February
1996 Indenture, April 1996 Indenture and June 1997 Indenture, as
applicable (collectively, the "POWERTEL INDENTURES"). Any investment banking
firm engaged in connection with such acquisition shall be selected by DT. DT
shall bear the fees, costs and expenses of acquiring the Notes.   SECTION
5.16. Employee Benefits. (a) As of the Effective Time, Powertel will have
terminated all Powertel Benefit Plans except for those Powertel Benefit Plans
that DT requests not be terminated and those Powertel Benefit Plans described
in Annex 5.18. DT shall take all necessary action so that, after the
Effective Time, any current or former employee of Powertel who is eligible to
participate in a Powertel Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time shall
either be eligible to continue his or her participation in such Powertel
Benefit Plan or participate in a corresponding employee benefit plan
maintained by DT or any of its Subsidiaries, subject to the terms of such
corresponding plan. DT shall have the sole discretion to determine which
current or former employees of Powertel will continue participation in a
Powertel Benefit Plan after the Effective Time and which will commence
participation in a corresponding employee      44  53  benefit plan
maintained by DT or any of its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time and,
with respect to current or former employees who transfer participation to
such a corresponding plan, when such transfer will occur. DT need not
treat all current and former employees of Powertel (including those who are
similarly situated) in the same manner with respect to which plans they
participate in and when, if at all, they transfer participation from a
Powertel Benefit Plan to a corresponding employee benefit plan maintained by
DT or any of its Subsidiaries. For example, DT may decide to have a current
or former employee of Powertel continue participation after the Effective
Time in certain Powertel Benefit Plans that have not been terminated, and
with respect to other benefits transition his or her participation on or
shortly after the Effective Time to a corresponding employee benefit plan
maintained by DT or one of its Subsidiaries. DT may take such actions (or
cause its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation to take such actions) as
are necessary or advisable to accomplish the foregoing, including, without
limitation, amending the eligibility provisions of plans of DT, any of its
Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation (including, without limitation,
Powertel Benefit Plans that are not terminated on or before the Effective
Time). Within 5 days of the date hereof, Powertel shall deliver a true and
complete list of each director, officer and employee of Powertel and
its Subsidiaries holding options under any Powertel Benefit Plan as of August
18, 2000, and the dollar or share amounts thereof.   (b) Except as
otherwise provided in this Section, nothing in this Agreement shall be
interpreted as limiting the power of the Surviving Corporation to amend or
terminate any particular Powertel Benefit Plan or any other particular
employee benefit plan, program, agreement or policy or as requiring the
Surviving Corporation or DT to offer to continue (other than as required by
its terms) any written employment contract or to continue the employment of
any specific person; provided, however, (1) that no such termination or
amendment may take away benefits or any other payments already accrued as of
the time of such termination or amendment without the consent of such person,
except as allowed by law, and (2) that nothing in this Section 5.01 shall be
interpreted as limiting or modifying any requirement in Section 5.18 or the
provisions of Annex 5.18.   (c) DT shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations, to the extent allowable under
applicable law, as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
current and former employees of Powertel and its Subsidiaries under any
welfare or fringe benefit plan in which such employees and former employees
may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time (other than a
Powertel Benefit Plan that is not terminated on or before the Effective
Time), other than limitations or waiting periods that are in effect with
respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied under the
corresponding welfare or fringe benefit plan maintained by Powertel for such
current and former employees prior to the Effective Time, (ii) provide each
current and former employee with credit under any welfare plans in which such
employee or former employee becomes eligible to participate after
the Effective Time for any co-payments and deductibles paid by such current
or former employee for the then current plan year under the corresponding
welfare plans maintained by Powertel prior to the Effective Time, and (iii)
provide (to the extent allowed by law and Treasury regulations applicable to
tax-qualified plans) each current and former employee with full credit for
purposes of eligibility, vesting, and determination of the level of benefits
under any employee benefit plans, policies, practices or arrangements
maintained by DT or any Subsidiary of DT for such current or former
employee\'s     45  54  service with Powertel or any Powertel
Subsidiary to the same extent recognized by Powertel immediately prior to the
Effective Time.   (d) Neither Powertel nor any Affiliate thereof shall, from
the date hereof until the Effective Time, without the prior express written
consent of DT, make any contribution, sale or other transfer of Powertel
Stock or any other "employer security" (as such term is defined in Section
407 of ERISA), whether to satisfy a required obligation, to reimburse for
expenses incurred, or otherwise, to any Powertel Benefit Plan or to the
Powertel stock fund (or any other fund) under the Powertel 401(k) Profit
Sharing Plan. Moreover, Powertel shall, promptly after the date hereof, amend
the Powertel 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (as amended and restated effective as
of January 1, 1998, and further amended August 23, 1999), (a) to require that
all contributions, from whatever source, be made in the form of cash and (b)
to preclude the use of any present or future Powertel 401(k) Profit Sharing
Plan assets to purchase from Powertel, or any Affiliate thereof, shares of
Powertel Stock or other "employer securities" (as such term is defined in
Section 407 of ERISA); it being understood, however, that such amendment need
not preclude the Powertel 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan from purchasing Powertel
Stock on the open market from any person or entity, other than Powertel or an
Affiliate thereof, nor require that shares of Powertel Stock and units in the
Powertel stock fund presently under the Powertel 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan
be sold or otherwise liquidated.   SECTION 5.17. Termination of Agreements
with Stockholders. Powertel agrees to the termination of the agreements
referred to in Section 7 of the Powertel Stockholder Agreements.   SECTION
5.18. Plans and Programs to be Implemented. After the execution of this
Agreement, Powertel and/or its subsidiaries shall adopt and implement the
plans and arrangements described in Annex 5.18 with each such plan
or arrangement being approved by VoiceStream and DT prior to such adoption
or implementation. Each such plan or arrangement shall be designed to
become effective as of the Effective Time (contingent upon the occurrence of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and remain effective
without modification of the terms and provisions of such plan or arrangement
until the termination date noted for each respective plan or arrangement in
Annex 5.18. After the execution of this Agreement, Powertel and/or its
subsidiaries shall take such actions as are required, necessary or
appropriate to implement the provisions of Annex 5.18 and this Section 5.18,
notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, and no such
actions shall be deemed to be a breach of any other provision of this
Agreement.   SECTION 5.19. Voting Agreement and Transfer Restrictions. (a)
If and when DT becomes a record or beneficial owner of any Shares, DT
agrees:   (i) that, from the date hereof until the later of January 1, 2001
and  the date of the VoiceStream Stockholders\' Meeting, without Powertel\'s
prior  written consent, it will not Transfer or agree to Transfer any
Shares,  Additional Shares, Rights or Additional Rights that it owns of
record or  beneficially, except (A) pursuant to the VoiceStream Merger
Agreement, (B)  Transfers to any Affiliate of DT who agrees in writing to be
bound by the  terms of this Section 5.19 or (C) Transfers which occur by
operation of law  if the transferee remains or agrees in writing to remain
bound by the terms  of this Section     46  55   5.19; provided,
however, that this Section 5.19(a)(i) shall cease to be of  any force or
effect immediately upon termination of the Alternative Merger  Agreement;
and   (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally to vote or cause to be voted or 
provide consent with respect to, all Shares and Additional Shares, if any, 
that it owns of record or beneficially as of the record date for the 
VoiceStream Stockholders\' Meeting at the VoiceStream Stockholders\' Meeting 
and at any other annual or special meeting of stockholders of VoiceStream  or
action by written consent where such matters arise in favor of the  "Merger"
contemplated by the Alternative Merger Agreement and, if required,  the other
transactions referenced in the Alternative Merger Agreement.   (iii) (a) to
complete and send the proxy card received by it with the  Joint Proxy
Statement, so that such proxy card is received by VoiceStream,  as prescribed
by the Joint Proxy Statement, not later than the fifth  Business Day
preceding the day of the VoiceStream Stockholders\' Meeting,  (b) to vote, by
completing such proxy card but not otherwise, all the  Shares it owns of
record or beneficially as of the record date for the  VoiceStream
Stockholders\' Meeting in favor of the "Merger" contemplated in  the
Alternative Merger Agreement and, if required, the other transactions 
referenced in the Alternative Merger Agreement and (c) not to revoke any 
such proxy.   (b) The provisions of Section 5.19(a)(i) shall terminate at
the earlier of the date indicated therein and the date of termination of the
Alternative Merger Agreement. Sections 5.19(a)(ii) and 5.19(a)(iii) shall
terminate on the earlier of the termination of the Alternative Merger
Agreement and the VoiceStream Stockholders\' Meeting.   (c) From and after
the date that this Agreement terminates in accordance with Article 7 hereof,
DT agrees to abide by the provisions of the second, third and fourth
sentences of Section 6 of the VoiceStream Stockholders\' Agreements as if DT
were a "Stockholder" named therein, provided that the First Amended and
Restated Voting Agreement dated July 23, 2000 takes effect as to DT in
accordance with its terms, and, provided, further, that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing contained
in this Section 5.19(c) shall require DT to take any action that adversely
affects its rights under the "DT Financing Agreements" (as defined in the
VoiceStream Merger Agreement) or that might result in DT\'s designees on the
VoiceStream Board of Directors in accordance with the DT Financing Agreements
to represent less than 10% of the total number of members of the VoiceStream
Board of Directors.   (d) For purposes of Section 5.19 only, the words
"beneficially owns" or similar expressions of ownership and capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set
forth in, or determined in accordance with, the VoiceStream Stockholder
Agreements as if DT were a "Stockholder" thereunder.   SECTION 5.20.
Powertel Warrants. After consultation with each other, DT and Powertel shall
use reasonable efforts to take such actions as they may deem to be
appropriate to attempt to cause the outstanding Powertel Warrants to
be exercised in full prior to the Effective Time, including by reducing
the exercise price of the Powertel Warrants to the extent agreed to by DT
and Powertel and in accordance with the provisions of the Powertel
Warrant Agreement.     47  56   ARTICLE 6   CLOSING CONDITIONS

applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act shall have

warranty of DT set forth in Section 3.07(a) of this Agreement shall have been
true and correct on the date hereof and on and as of the Closing Date as
though made on the Closing Date; and the other representations and warranties
of DT set forth in this Agreement shall have been true and correct on the
date     48  57  hereof and on and as of the Closing Date as though
made on the Closing Date (except to the extent that any representation or
warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case it shall be
true and correct as of such date) except (i) for changes permitted under
Section 4.02 or otherwise contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) for such
failures to be true and correct which in the aggregate would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on DT.   (b) Agreements
and Covenants. DT shall have performed or complied with all agreements and
covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it
on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that for purposes of this
Section 6.02(b) only, such agreements and covenants shall be deemed to have

of an executive officer of DT to the effect set forth in subparagraphs (a)

the Merger (i) will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and (ii) each transfer of property to DT by a stockholder
of Powertel pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to Section 367(a)(1)
of the Code. In rendering such opinion, Morris, Manning and Martin, LLP may
require and shall be entitled to rely upon customary representations of
Powertel and DT, including representations substantially in the form of
Exhibits B and C, respectively and, if reasonably requested, customary tax
certificates of Powertel Principal Shareholders. The opinion set forth in
clause (ii) may assume that any stockholder who is a "five-percent transferee

U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.3.67(a)-3(c)(1)(iii)(B).   (e) FCC

been received, unless the failure to receive any such consent or
authorization would not have a Material Adverse Effect on DT or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such consents or
authorizations shall not contain any conditions which would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on DT or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. With respect to any FCC consents or
authorizations, effectiveness of necessary FCC approvals shall be sufficient
to satisfy this condition, and Powertel\'s obligation to effect the Merger
shall not be subject to the condition that any FCC consents or authorizations
have become Final Orders.   Notwithstanding anything contained to the
contrary in Section 6.02(a) or anywhere else in this Agreement, DT may enter
into any Subsequent Transaction, and no     49  58  changes of any
representation or warranty of DT contained in this Agreement as a result of
any Subsequent Transaction shall result in a failure of the conditions set
forth in Section 6.02(a).   SECTION 6.03. Conditions to the Obligations of
DT. The obligations of DT to consummate the Merger are also subject to the

Agreement shall have been true and correct on the date hereof and on and as
of the Closing Date as though made on the Closing Date; and the other
representations and warranties of Powertel set forth in this Agreement shall
have been true and correct on the date hereof and on and as of the Closing
Date as though made on the Closing Date (except to the extent that any
representation or warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which
case it shall be true and correct as of such date) except (i) for changes
permitted under Section 4.01 hereof or otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) for such failures to be true and correct which in

Adverse Effect on Powertel or DT or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (b) Agreements and Covenants. Powertel shall have performed or
complied with all agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by it on or before the Effective Time; provided,
however, that for purposes of this Section 6.03(b) only, such agreements and
covenants shall be deemed to have been complied with unless the failure or
failures of such agreements and covenants to have been complied with
individually or in the aggregate, results or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on Powertel or DT or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (c) Certificates. DT shall have received
a certificate of an executive officer of Powertel to the effect set forth in
subparagraphs (a) and (b) above.   (d) Tax Opinion. DT shall have received
an opinion of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to DT, dated as of the Closing Date, substantially to
the effect that, on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions set
forth or referred to in such opinion, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
the Merger will (i) qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and (ii) each transfer of property to DT by a stockholder

1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii) will file the agreement described in U.S. Treasury
Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(iii)(B).   (e) FCC Opinion. DT shall
have received an opinion of FCC counsel of Powertel, dated the Effective
Time, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D.   (f)
Consents Under Agreements. Powertel shall have obtained the consent or
approval of each person whose consent or approval shall be required
in connection with the     50  59  transactions contemplated hereby
under any indenture, mortgage, evidence of indebtedness, lease or other
agreement or instrument to which Powertel or any of the Powertel Subsidiaries
is a party, except where the failure to obtain the same would not reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Powertel or DT or upon the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   (g) Governmental Approvals. All necessary consents or
authorizations from any Governmental or Regulatory Authority which may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the FCC and state public utility or service commissions or similar agencies,
shall have been received and, in the case of the FCC, shall have become Final
Orders (unless this requirement of finality is waived by DT in its sole
discretion), unless the failure to receive any such consent or authorization
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Powertel or DT or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such consents or
authorizations shall not contain any conditions which would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Powertel or DT or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   ARTICLE 7   TERMINATION,

Termination Date;   (c) By either Powertel or DT, if any Governmental or
Regulatory Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken
any other action (which order, decree or ruling Powertel and DT shall use its

Closing Date, as soon as possible after the Effective Time, DT shall issue to
the Escrow Agent for the account of the Options Trust, the trustee of which
shall be a United States bank or trust company or other independent financial
institution in the United States (other than the Escrow Agent) reasonably
satisfactory to DT and Powertel (the "OPTIONS TRUSTEE"), that number of DT
Ordinary Shares equal to the Powertel Option Amount in consideration for the
share for share Powertel exchange. In connection therewith, the Trustee shall
assume the obligation to satisfy the Powertel Rollover Options. The DT
Ordinary Shares shall be held in the name of the Options Trustee for the sole
purpose of satisfying obligations under the Powertel Rollover Options. In
connection therewith, the Options Trustee, DT and the Escrow Agent shall
enter into an agreement prior to the Effective Time establishing such Options
Trust for the sole purpose of satisfying obligations under the Powertel
Rollover Options (the "OPTIONS TRUST AGREEMENT"). Powertel shall have no
right, title, interest or claim on any of the assets held in the Options
Trust.   Upon exercise of any Powertel Rollover Option by the holder
thereof and, except as set forth below for cashless exercises delivery by
such holder to the Options Trustee of the consideration for the exercise
therefor, the Options Trustee shall deliver to such holder that number of DT
Ordinary Shares for which such Powertel Rollover Option was exercisable. In
the event that a holder of Powertel Rollover Options elects to exercise a
Powertel Rollover Option pursuant to a "cashless exercise," to the extent
permitted in the applicable Option Plan (or any award agreement thereunder),
such holder shall notify the Options Trustee and shall retain a broker in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the applicable Option Plan to
sell the number of DT Ordinary Shares equal to the exercise price of such
Powertel Rollover Option and      1.08(a)-1  79  the broker shall
deliver the proceeds of such DT Ordinary Shares up to an amount equal to the
exercise price to the Options Trustee and shall deliver the balance of the DT
Ordinary Shares to the holder. In the event that a holder elects to have DT
Ordinary Shares withheld to satisfy withholding tax obligations applicable to
the exercise of a Powertel Rollover Option to the extent permitted by the
applicable Option Plan (or any award agreement thereunder), such holder shall
notify the Options Trustee and the Options Trustee shall retain a broker in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the applicable Powertel
Option Plan to sell the number of DT Ordinary Shares equal to the withholding
tax obligations applicable to such exercise and the broker shall deliver
the proceeds of such DT Ordinary Shares up to an amount equal to the
withholding tax obligations to the Options Trustee and the balance of the DT
Ordinary Shares to the holder.   At such times as any Powertel Rollover
Option expires, the DT Ordinary Shares in the Options Trust that pertain to
such Powertel Rollover Option shall be returned to DT or, at the option of
DT, shall be sold and the proceeds thereof delivered to DT. The consideration
delivered to the Options Trustee for the exercise of any Powertel Rollover
Option shall thereupon be delivered to DT. At such time as all the Powertel
Rollover Options have been exercised or expired, any DT Ordinary Shares or
any consideration for the exercise of any Powertel Rollover Option that
remain in the Options Trust shall be returned to DT or, at the option of DT,
any such DT Ordinary Shares shall be sold and the proceeds thereof delivered
to DT, and the Options Trust shall be terminated. Except as provided above,
the Options Trustee shall hold the DT Ordinary Shares and shall not otherwise
transfer them. Upon a bankruptcy or insolvency of DT or Powertel or any other
event under German or, as the case may be, U.S. law that is substantially
similar to a bankruptcy or insolvency of DT or Powertel (including
without      1.08(a)-2   80 limitation Insolvenzverfahren), the assets
of the Options Trust shall be held for the benefit of DT\'s or Powertel\'s,
as the case may be, general creditors.   The Options Trust Agreement shall
provide that the Options Trustee shall irrevocably waive any dividend, voting
and subscription rights pertaining to the DT Ordinary Shares while such
Shares are held in the Options Trust.   By no later than the Effective Time,
DT shall take, or shall cause to be taken, all actions as are necessary or
advisable for the conversion of the Options in accordance with Annex 1.08 of
this Agreement, including (i) the issuance and listing of DT Ordinary Shares
as is necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by Annex 1.08(a) of
this Agreement, (ii) entering into such agreements as are necessary or
advisable to establish the Options Trust and (iii) the filing of a
registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 or any other applicable form
to register the DT Ordinary Shares held in the Options Trust.   Powertel
shall take, or shall cause to be taken, all actions as are reasonably
necessary or advisable to amend and/or make determinations under
the applicable Option Plans to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Annex 1.08(a) and Section 1.08 of this Agreement.   The Options Trust
Agreement shall be subject to the review and approval of Powertel prior to
the Effective Time, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the
event of any corporate transaction involving the DT Ordinary Shares,
including without limitation a stock split, stock dividend, spin-off, merger
or reorganization, the number and kind of shares in the Options Trust shall
be appropriately and equitably adjusted. In the event the Options Trust does
not honor the exercise of a Powertel Rollover Option or otherwise deliver DT
Ordinary Shares upon the exercise of a Powertel Rollover Option, DT shall
upon written notice from the holder of such option, deliver or cause to
be delivered to such holder the appropriate number of DT     
1.08(a)-3  81  Ordinary Shares due upon exercise, or, if not permitted by
law to deliver such shares, DT shall or shall cause to be delivered to such
holder the excess of the aggregate fair market value on such date of the DT
Ordinary Shares with respect to which such option is exercised minus the
aggregate exercise price payable with respect to such exercise. Any return of
DT Ordinary Shares to DT described above shall have no effect upon the terms
and conditions of the Powertel Rollover Options or the rights of the
optionees.   If the Trustee (including in the case of bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar events, as described above) is under applicable law prohibited
from fulfilling its obligations to deliver shares with respect to the
Powertel Rollover Options pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Powertel Rollover Options, DT shall, at the election of the option holder,
cause to be substituted for the Powertel Rollover Options stock appreciation
rights exercisable against DT for cash on substantially similar terms and
conditions as the Powertel Rollover Options.        1.08(a)-4   '
