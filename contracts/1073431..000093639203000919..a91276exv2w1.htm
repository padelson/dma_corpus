Agreement has executed a written consent with respect to all shares of Target
Capital Stock held by such holder, approving this Agreement and the Merger, and
as a result, the Required Shareholder Vote has been obtained. The Board of
Directors of Target has unanimously (a)&nbsp;adopted this Agreement and approved its
execution and delivery and the consummation of the Merger; and (b)&nbsp;determined
that the Merger is in the best interests of the shareholders of Target and is
on terms that are fair to such shareholders. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Target and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a

constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Target, enforceable against
Target in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting

regardless of whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Target does not constitute, and the
consummation by Target of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result
in, a termination, or breach or violation by Target of, or a default by Target
under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), (a)&nbsp;any provision of
the articles of incorporation or bylaws of Target, as amended, (b)&nbsp;any Material

of Section&nbsp;3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (&#147;ERISA&#148;), which is, or has been, sponsored, maintained, contributed
to, or required to be contributed to by Target or its Subsidiaries and, with
respect to any such plans which are subject to Code Section&nbsp;401(a), any trade
or business (whether or not incorporated) that is or at any relevant time was
treated as a single employer with Target within the meaning of Section&nbsp;414(b),
(c), (m)&nbsp;or (o)&nbsp;of the Code (an &#147;ERISA Affiliate&#148;), for the benefit of any

Affiliate has, or is reasonably likely to have, any material liability or

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">related notices, registration statements and prospectuses and, to the
extent still in its possession, any material employee communications relating
thereto. With respect to each Target Employee Plan that is subject to ERISA
reporting requirements, Target has made available in a data room for review by
Acquiror or its advisors copies of the Form&nbsp;5500 reports filed for the last
five plan years. Target has made available in a data room for review by
Acquiror or its advisors the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination
or opinion letter issued with respect to each such Target Employee Plan, and to
Target&#146;s knowledge, nothing has occurred since the issuance of each such letter
that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the tax-qualified status
of any Target Employee Plan subject to Code Section&nbsp;401(a).
</FONT>


<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Compliance. Each Target Employee Plan is being, and has been,
administered substantially in accordance with its terms and in material
compliance with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and
regulations (including ERISA and the Code). Target and each ERISA Affiliate
are not in material default under or material violation of, and have no
knowledge of any material default or material violation by any other party to,
any of the Target Employee Plans. Any Target Employee Plan intended to be
qualified under Section&nbsp;401(a) of the Code has either obtained from the
Internal Revenue Service a favorable determination letter as to its qualified
status under the Code, including all currently effective amendments to the
Code, or has time remaining to apply under applicable Treasury Regulations or
Internal Revenue Service pronouncements for a determination or opinion letter
or to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination or
opinion letter. None of the Target Employee Plans promises or provides retiree
medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person. Target has not
engaged in, or participated in, any transaction which would be considered a
non-exempt &#147;prohibited transaction,&#148; as such term is defined in Section&nbsp;406 of
ERISA or Section&nbsp;4975 of the Code, and to Target&#146;s knowledge, no other
third-party fiduciary and/or party-in-interest has engaged in any such
&#147;prohibited transaction&#148; with respect to any Target Employee Plan. Neither
Target nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any liability or penalty under
Sections&nbsp;4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any
Target Employee Plan. All contributions required to be made by Target or any
ERISA Affiliate to any Target Employee Plan have been paid or accrued. With
respect to each Target Employee Plan, no &#147;reportable event&#148; within the meaning
of Section&nbsp;4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the thirty (30)
day notice requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section&nbsp;4043 of
ERISA) has occurred, nor has any event described in Section&nbsp;4062, 4063 or 4041
or ERISA occurred. Each Target Employee Plan subject to ERISA has prepared in
good faith and timely filed all requisite governmental reports, which were true
and correct in all material respects as of the date filed, and has properly and
timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees
required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Target
Employee Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding or action has been brought,
or to the knowledge of Target is overtly threatened in communication with
Target, against or with respect to any such Target Employment Plan, including
any audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States
Department of Labor. There has been no amendment to, or written interpretation
or announcement by Target or any ERISA Affiliate regarding any Target Employee
Plan that would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Target
Employee Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to that Plan for
the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2002.

Surviving Corporation); provided, however, that neither Acquiror nor the

settlement effected without its, his or her express written consent. The
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm (in addition to
local counsel) to represent them with respect to any single action unless

reasonably likely to arise on any material issue between the positions of any
two or more Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section&nbsp;6.7(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, Acquiror shall
not settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise
seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this Section&nbsp;6.7
unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnified Parties from all liability arising out
of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any
waiver of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement must be in writing
and must be duly executed by or on behalf of the party to be charged with such
waiver. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the failure of a
party to exercise any of its rights hereunder or to insist upon strict

shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any other term of condition
hereof (whether or not similar).
