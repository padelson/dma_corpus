 B. In connection with the Merger, the outstanding shares of Targets capital stock will be converted into the right to receive the cash amounts described in this Agreement, and Acquiror will assume all outstanding options to purchase Targets capital stock.   

 C. Acquiror will place a portion of the cash amounts payable to Targets shareholders into escrow, the release of which will be contingent upon the occurrence of certain events and the satisfaction of certain conditions as set forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement to be executed and delivered in accordance with Section 6.4 (the "Escrow Agreement").   

 D. Prior to the Merger, all outstanding shares of Targets Series A Preferred Stock (par value $0.001 per share) ("Target Preferred Stock") will be converted into shares of Targets common stock (par value $0.001 per share) ("Target Common Stock") (collectively, the Target Preferred Stock and Target Common Stock are referred to herein as "Target Capital Stock").   

 E. Target, Acquiror and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations and warranties and enter into certain covenants in connection with the Merger.

The consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place as soon as practicable, but no later than two business days, after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth in Section 7 to be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), or at such other time as the parties hereto agree (the actual date on which the Closing takes place being the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall take place at the offices of Gray Cary Ware and Freidenrich LLP, 4365 Executive Drive, Suite 1100, San Diego, CA 92121-2133, or at such other location as the parties hereto agree. In connection with the Closing, Target shall cause the Merger to be made effective by filing Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Oregon in accordance with the relevant provisions of Oregon Law (the time of such filing being the "Effective Time").   

 2.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger filed pursuant to Section 2.2 and the applicable provisions of Oregon Law.   

 2.4 Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws. Unless otherwise agreed to by Acquiror and Target prior to the Closing, at the Effective Time (and subject to Section 6.7(a)):    

 (a) the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by Oregon Law and such articles of incorporation; provided, however, that Article I of the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Molecular Probes, Inc."; and    

 (b) the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended.    ##### 

   

 2.5 Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, to serve until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.   

 2.6 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Acquiror, Merger Sub, Target or the holders of any of the following securities:    

 (a) each share of Target Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an amount of cash (the "Per Share Price") equal to (i) the sum of (A) $323,000,000 _plus_ (B) the sum of the aggregate exercise prices of all unexercised options to purchase Target Capital Stock (whether vested or unvested) that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, _divided by_ (ii) the sum of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Target Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time _plus_ (B) the aggregate number of shares of Target Capital Stock subject to unexercised options to purchase Target Capital Stock (whether vested or unvested) that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time; and    

 (b) each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   

 2.7 Target Stock Options.    

 (a) At the Effective Time, Acquiror will assume Targets 2001 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2001 Option Plan") and 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Option Plan" and together with the 2001 Option Plan, the "Target Option Plans"). At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Target Capital Stock that was granted under a Target Option Plan and is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a "Target Option") shall be assumed by Acquiror and converted into an option (an "Assumed Option") to purchase (1) in the case of a Target Option to purchase shares of Target Common Stock, the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Target Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Target Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Conversion Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (2) in the case of a Target Option to purchase shares of Target Preferred Stock, the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Target Common Stock that were issuable upon the conversion of the Target Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of such Target Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ the Conversion Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The per share exercise price of each Assumed Option shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the per share exercise price of the corresponding Target Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Conversion Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent; provided, however, that if Section 421 of the Code applies to such Target Option by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, then the exercise price of the corresponding Assumed Option, the number of shares purchasable pursuant to such Assumed Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such Assumed Option shall be determined in  ##### 

   

order to comply with Section 424 of the Code. Except for the
foregoing adjustments, all of the terms and conditions in effect for each
Target Option immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue in
effect following the assumption thereof in accordance with this Agreement and
its terms (including any terms regarding adjustments for stock splits and
similar transactions). For purposes of this Section 2.7, (i) the term
"Conversion Ratio" shall mean the ratio of (A) the Per Share Price to (B) the
closing sales price of a share of Acquiror Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock
Market on the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Merger
becomes effective, and (ii) an option providing the holder thereof with the
right to purchase both Target Common Stock and Target Preferred Stock shall
be considered two separate Target Options (an option to purchase Target
Common Stock and a separate option to purchase Target Preferred Stock).
Acquiror shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, within seven
days after the Closing Date, a registration statement on Form S-8 relating to
the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable in respect of the Assumed
Options.    

 (b) Schedule 2.7(b) sets forth a true and complete list, as of the date hereof, of all Target Options, including, with respect to each such Target Option, (i) the name of the holder of such Target Option, (ii) the number and class of shares of Target Capital Stock subject to such Target Option, (iii) the exercise or vesting schedule applicable to such Target Option, (iv) the exercise price per share of such Target Option and (v) the term of such Target Option. On the Closing Date, Target shall deliver to Acquiror an updated version of Schedule 2.7(b) that is current as of such date.   

 2.8 Surrender of Certificates.    

 (a) No Further Rights as Target Shareholders. At the Effective Time, all shares of Target Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no holder of record of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Target Capital Stock (a "Certificate") shall have any rights as a shareholder of Target.    

 (b) Exchange Procedures. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to Acquiror, together with a letter of transmittal in form reasonably acceptable to Acquiror and Target, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, (i) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount equal to the Per Share Price _multiplied by_ the number of shares of Target Common Stock represented by such Certificate, less the portion of such cash amount to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holders behalf pursuant to Section 9.1, and (ii) the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Acquiror shall, no later than two business days after receipt of each properly surrendered Certificate, cause the payment described in the preceding sentence to be made to the holder of such Certificate by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by such holder in the letter of transmittal delivered with such Certificate. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Target Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence the right to receive the Per Share Price for each of such shares (subject to the provisions hereof relating to the Escrow Fund). If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.8.    ##### 

    

 (c) Transfers of Ownership. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Target shall be closed, and there shall thereafter be no further registration of transfers of shares of Target Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time on the records of Target.    

 (d) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.8, neither Acquiror nor the Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to any person for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar law.   

 2.9 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Acquiror shall pay to the record holder of such Certificate the consideration into which the shares of Target Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 2.6, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by such record holder; provided, however, that Acquiror may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such consideration, require such record holder to deliver a bond in such sum as Acquiror may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate.   

 2.10 Withholding Rights.    

 (a) Each of the Surviving Corporation and Acquiror shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.6(a) to any Former Shareholder (including in connection with the exercise of any Target Stock Option prior to the Effective Time entitling the holder of the Target Capital Stock issued thereunder to receive consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(a)) such amounts, if any, as the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the payment of such consideration under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of any other Tax law.    

 (b) To the extent that amounts are properly withheld from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.6(a) to any Former Shareholder as provided in this Section 2.10, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Former Shareholder.   

 2.11 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any share of Target Capital Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which is held by a shareholder who did not consent to or vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement, which shareholder complies with all of the provisions of Oregon Law relevant to the exercise of dissenters rights (such share being a "Dissenting Share," and such shareholder being a "Dissenting Shareholder"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the consideration to which the holder of such share would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.6, but rather shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to Oregon Law. If any Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect such shareholders dissenters rights under Oregon Law or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses such rights with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon automatically be converted into the right to receive the  ##### 

  

consideration referred to in Section 2.6, pursuant to the exchange procedures
set forth in Section 2.8. Target shall give Acquiror (a) prompt notice of any
demand for payment of the fair value of any shares of Target Capital Stock or
any attempted withdrawal of any such demand for payment and any other
instrument served pursuant to Oregon Law and received by Target relating to
any shareholders dissenters rights, and (b) the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for
payment under Oregon Law. Target shall not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or make a binding offer to settle, any such demand for
payment at any time prior to the Closing, unless Target shall have first
obtained Acquirors consent.   

 2.12 Taking of Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Target and Merger Sub, Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in their respective names to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary or desirable action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.   

 2.13 Working Capital Adjustment.    

 (a) Adjusted Working Capital Amount. For purposes of this Agreement, "Adjusted Working Capital Amount" means (i) the aggregate dollar amount of all assets properly characterized as current assets of Target and its Subsidiaries under the Specified Accounting Principles as of the time immediately prior to the Closing, _plus_ (ii) the aggregate dollar amount of all payments of Specified Transactional Expenses made at or prior to the Closing, _minus_ (iii) the aggregate dollar amount of all liabilities properly characterized as current liabilities of Target and its Subsidiaries under the Specified Accounting Principles as of the time immediately prior to the Closing (including current liabilities representing accrued bonuses payable to Richard P. Haugland and Rosaria P. Haugland), excluding all such liabilities representing obligations to pay Specified Transactional Expenses.    

 (b) Calculation. No later than 30 days following the Closing Date, the Shareholders Agent shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Acquiror an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Target and its Subsidiaries as of the time immediately prior to the Closing (the "Closing Balance Sheet") together with a statement (the "Agents Working Capital Statement") setting forth the calculation by the Shareholders Agent of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount.    

 (c) Access; Review; Disputes.

Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate (the Surviving Corporations expense),
with the Shareholders Agent and any accountants or advisors retained by the
Shareholders Agent, for the purposes of enabling the Shareholders Agent and
its accountants and advisors to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Agents Working Capital Statement. Acquiror shall also cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide the Shareholders Agent, and any accountants
or advisors retained by the Shareholders Agent, with the access described
above in connection with any proceedings involving the Designated Accounting
Firm as described in clause "(iv)" below, and the Shareholders Agent shall
make himself reasonably available during normal business hours to Acquiror,
and to any accountants or advisors retained by Acquiror, to discuss the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Agents Working Capital Statement in connection
with any proceedings involving the Designated Accounting Firm as described in
clause "(iv)" below.    

 (ii) If the Acquiror disputes the calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount set forth in the Agents Working Capital Statement, then, during the 45-day period commencing upon delivery of the Agents Working Capital Statement to Acquiror (the "Review Period"), Acquiror shall deliver a written notice setting forth the bases for Acquirors dispute of such calculation (a "Dispute Notice") to the Shareholders Agent and the Escrow Agent.    

 (iii) If the Shareholders Agent does not receive a Dispute Notice from Acquiror prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount set forth in the Agents Working Capital Statement shall be deemed final and binding on Acquiror and the Shareholders Agent and the Former Shareholders for all purposes.    

 (iv) If the Shareholders Agent receives a Dispute Notice from Acquiror prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the Shareholders Agent and Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the Adjusted Working Capital Amount. If the Shareholders Agent and Acquiror are unable to reach agreement on the Adjusted Working Capital Amount within 20 days after the end of the Review Period, either party shall have the right to refer such dispute to the Portland, Oregon, office of KPMG (such firm, or any successor thereto, being referred to herein as the "Designated Accounting Firm"). In connection with the resolution of any such dispute by the Designated Accounting Firm: (i) each of Acquiror and the Shareholders Agent shall have a reasonable opportunity to meet with the Designated Accounting Firm to provide its views as to any disputed issues with respect to the calculation of the Closing Working Capital Amount; (ii) the Designated Accounting Firm shall determine the Adjusted Working Capital Amount in accordance with the Specified Accounting Principles within 30 days of the referral of such dispute to the Designated Accounting Firm; (iii) upon making its final determination of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount, the Designated Accounting Firm shall deliver a copy of its calculations (the "Expert Calculations") to the Shareholders Agent, Acquiror and the Escrow Agent; and (iv) the determination of the Closing Working Capital Amount made by the Designated Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on Acquiror, the Shareholders Agent and the Former Shareholders for all purposes, absent manifest error. The Expert Calculations shall reflect and explain in detail the differences, if any, between the Adjusted Working Capital Amount reflected therein and the Adjusted Working Capital Amount set forth in the Agents Working Capital Statement.    ##### 

    

 (v) The professional fees and other expenses incurred by the Shareholders Agent in connection with the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Agents Working Capital Statement shall be borne by the Shareholders Agent. The fees and expenses of the Designated Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Acquiror and the Shareholders Agent; provided, however, that if the Adjusted Working Capital Amount reflected in the Agents Working Capital Statement exceeds the Adjusted Working Capital Amount calculated by the Designated Accounting Firm by more than $100,000, then the entire amount of such fees and expenses shall be borne by the Shareholders Agent. All such fees and expenses payable by the Shareholders Agent (including all fees and expenses payable in connection with the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Agents Working Capital Statement, and any portion of the fees and expenses of the Designated Accounting Firm borne by the Shareholders Agent) shall be reimbursable to or payable by the Shareholders Agent directly from the Escrow Fund, without the requirement of any consent or approval by Acquiror.    

 (d) Adjustment of Amounts Payable to Former Shareholders.    

 (i) If the Adjusted Working Capital Amount, as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.13, exceeds the Base Working Capital Amount, then, no later than three business days after the final determination of the Adjusted Working Capital Amount, Acquiror shall cause to be paid to each Former Shareholder, in immediately available funds, such Former Shareholders Pro Rata Portion of the amount by which the Adjusted Working Capital Amount exceeds the Base Working Capital Amount.

Section 3.19 of the Target Disclosure Schedule separately lists, as of the date of this Agreement, each Target Employee Plan that is currently in effect and that has been adopted or maintained by Target or its Subsidiaries, whether formally or informally, for the benefit of employees outside the United States (collectively, the "Target International Employee Plans").    

 (b) Documents. Target has delivered to Acquiror or its advisors (or made available in a data room for review by Acquiror or its advisors) true and complete copies of each of the Target Employee Plans and related plan documents, including trust documents, group annuity contracts, plan amendments, insurance policies or contracts, participant agreements, employee booklets, administrative service agreements, summary plan descriptions, compliance and nondiscrimination tests for the last three plan years, standard COBRA forms and  ##### 

   

related notices, registration statements and prospectuses and, to the extent
still in its possession, any material employee communications
relating thereto. With respect to each Target Employee Plan that is subject
to ERISA reporting requirements, Target has made available in a data room for
review by Acquiror or its advisors copies of the Form 5500 reports filed for
the last five plan years. Target has made available in a data room for review
by Acquiror or its advisors the most recent Internal Revenue Service
determination or opinion letter issued with respect to each such Target
Employee Plan, and to Targets knowledge, nothing has occurred since the
issuance of each such letter that would reasonably be expected to cause the
loss of the tax-qualified status of any Target Employee Plan subject to Code
Section 401(a).    

 (c) Compliance. Each Target Employee Plan is being, and has been, administered substantially in accordance with its terms and in material compliance with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, rules and regulations (including ERISA and the Code). Target and each ERISA Affiliate are not in material default under or material violation of, and have no knowledge of any material default or material violation by any other party to, any of the Target Employee Plans. Any Target Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has either obtained from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including all currently effective amendments to the Code, or has time remaining to apply under applicable Treasury Regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements for a determination or opinion letter or to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination or opinion letter. None of the Target Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person. Target has not engaged in, or participated in, any transaction which would be considered a non-exempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and to Targets knowledge, no other third-party fiduciary and/or party-in-interest has engaged in any such "prohibited transaction" with respect to any Target Employee Plan. Neither Target nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any liability or penalty under Sections 4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any Target Employee Plan. All contributions required to be made by Target or any ERISA Affiliate to any Target Employee Plan have been paid or accrued. With respect to each Target Employee Plan, no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the thirty (30) day notice requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred, nor has any event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 or ERISA occurred. Each Target Employee Plan subject to ERISA has prepared in good faith and timely filed all requisite governmental reports, which were true and correct in all material respects as of the date filed, and has properly and timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Target Employee Plan. No suit, administrative proceeding or action has been brought, or to the knowledge of Target is overtly threatened in communication with Target, against or with respect to any such Target Employment Plan, including any audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Department of Labor. There has been no amendment to, or written interpretation or announcement by Target or any ERISA Affiliate regarding any Target Employee Plan that would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Target Employee Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to that Plan for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002.    ##### 

    

 (d) No Title IV or Multiemployer Plan. Neither Target nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to, or is obligated to materially contribute to, or otherwise incurred any obligation or liability (including any contingent liability) under, any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or any "pension plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither Target nor any ERISA Affiliate has, as of the date of this Agreement, any actual or potential withdrawal liability (including any contingent liability) for any complete or partial withdrawal (as defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA) from any multiemployer plan.    

 (e) No Self-Insured Plans. Neither Target nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any self-insured plan that is governed by ERISA and that provides benefits to employees (including any such plan pursuant to which a stop-loss policy or contract applies), other than a health care reimbursement plan.    

 (f) COBRA, FMLA, HIPAA, Cancer Rights. With respect to each Target Employee Plan, Target is in material compliance with (i) the applicable health care continuation and notice provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ("COBRA") and the regulations thereunder or any state law governing health care coverage extension or continuation; (ii) the applicable requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the regulations thereunder; (iii) the applicable requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"); and (iv) the applicable requirements of the Cancer Rights Act of 1998. Target has no material unsatisfied obligations to any employees, former employees or qualified beneficiaries pursuant to COBRA, HIPAA or any state law governing health care coverage extension or continuation.    

 (g) Effect of Transaction. Except as provided in Section 3.19 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the Merger will not (i) entitle any current or former employee or other service provider of Target or any ERISA Affiliate to severance benefits or any other payment (including unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or benefits under any Target Employee Plan), except as expressly provided in this Agreement; or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee or service provider. No benefit payable or that may become payable by Target pursuant to any Target Employee Plan or as a result of or arising under this Agreement shall constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) subject to the imposition of an excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code or the deduction for which would be disallowed by reason of Section 280G of the Code. Each Target Employee Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without material liability to Acquiror or Target other than ordinary administration expenses typically incurred in a termination event.    

 (h) International Employee Plans. Each of the Target International Employee Plans has been established, maintained and administered in compliance in all material respects with its terms and conditions and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutory or regulatory laws applicable to such Target International Employee Plan. No Target International Employee Plan has material unfunded liabilities that as of the Effective Time will  ##### 

   

not be offset by insurance or fully accrued. Except as required by law, no
condition exists that would prevent Target from terminating or amending
any Target International Employee Plan at any time for any reason.    

 (i) Neither Target nor its Subsidiaries are a party to any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement, including but not limited to the provisions of this Agreement, covering any employee or former employee of Target or its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to give rise to the payment of any material amount that would be subject to the deductibility limits of Section 404 of the Code.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, promptly after the date of this Agreement, Acquiror and Target shall cause to be prepared and filed the notifications required under HSR in connection with the Merger. Acquiror and Target shall respond as promptly as practicable to (i) any inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice for additional information or documentation and (ii) any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general or other Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust or related matters.

 (b) Acquiror shall enroll all Target Employees in the Acquiror plans, programs, policies, practices, contracts, agreements or other arrangements providing for employment, compensation, retirement, deferred compensation, loans, severance, separation, termination pay, performance awards, bonus, incentive, stock option, stock purchase, stock bonus, phantom stock, stock appreciation right, supplemental retirement, fringe benefits, cafeteria benefits or other benefits, whether written or unwritten, including each "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA (the "Acquiror Employee Plans"), to the extent applicable, which are provided to similarly situated employees of Acquiror based on levels of responsibility, using commercially reasonable efforts to cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of Acquiror or its affiliates to be waived with respect to Target Employees and their eligible dependents, giving each Target Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made, and giving such Target Employees service credit for their employment with Target for eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for benefit accrual) under any such applicable Acquiror Employee Plan, as if such service had been performed with Acquiror. Until the effective date of the enrollment of the Target Employees in a    ##### 

 

particular Acquiror Employee Plan, Acquiror shall continue in effect
without amendment or reduction in benefits the existing Target Employee Plan
covering the same or similar benefits as would be covered by such Acquiror
Employee Plan. Nothing in this Section 6.5 is intended to prevent Acquiror
from terminating any of its benefit plans in a manner that does not affect
the vested or other pre-existing rights of any Target Employee.    

 (c) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, Target and any ERISA Affiliate, shall have terminated any and all Target Employee Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each a "Target 401(k) Plan" and collectively, the "Target 401(k) Plans") (unless Acquiror shall have provided written notice to Target that such Target 401(k) Plans shall not be terminated). Unless Acquiror provides such written notice to Target, no later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, Target shall have provided Acquiror with evidence that such Target 401(k) Plans have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of Target. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Acquiror. Target also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Target 401(k) Plans as Acquiror may reasonably require. In the event that termination of a Target 401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees then Target shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Acquiror no later than ten (10) calendar days prior to the Closing Date.    

 (d) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, Target and any ERISA Affiliate, shall have terminated the Interfacial Dynamics Corporation Profit Sharing Plan (the "IDC Profit Sharing Plan") (unless Acquiror shall have provided written notice to Target that such IDC Profit Sharing Plan shall not be terminated) and shall have either, caused to be made any final contributions owed under the IDC Profit Sharing Plan as of such date of termination, or reflected such amounts on the Closing Balance Sheet. Unless Acquiror provides such written notice to Target, no later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, Target shall have provided Acquiror with evidence that such IDC Profit Sharing Plan shall have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors of Target. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Acquiror. Target also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating the IDC Profit Sharing Plan as Acquiror may reasonably require. In the event that termination of the IDC Profit Sharing Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender charges or other fees then Target shall take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Acquiror no later than ten (10) calendar days prior to the Closing Date.    

 (e) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, Target and any ERISA Affiliate, shall have taken, after consultation with Acquirors legal counsel, the appropriate actions necessary to properly begin the termination process for the Interfacial Dynamics Corporation Money Purchase Pension Plan (the "IDC MPP") and shall have provided, or provide as of the Closing Date, the required notices under Section 204(h) of ERISA to participants of the IDC MPP (unless Acquiror shall have provided written notice to Target that such IDC MPP shall not be terminated). Unless Acquiror provides such written    ##### 

 

notice to Target, no later than five (5) business days prior to the Closing
Date, Target shall have provided Acquiror with evidence that such IDC MPP has
begun the process of termination and that the required 204(h) notices under
ERISA have been, or will be provided (effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Directors
of Target. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
review and approval of Acquiror. Target also shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating such IDC MPP as Acquiror may reasonably require.
Target shall also have either, caused to be made any final contributions owed
under the IDC MPP as of such date of termination, or reflected such amounts
on the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event that termination of the IDC MPP
would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation charges, surrender
charges or other fees then Target shall take such actions as are necessary to
reasonably estimate the amount of such charges and/or fees and provide such
estimate in writing to Acquiror no later than ten (10) calendar days prior to
the Closing Date.   

 6.6 FIRPTA Matters. At the Closing, Target shall deliver to Acquiror: (a) a statement conforming to the requirements of Section 1.897  2(h)(1)(i) of the United States Treasury Regulations; and (b) the notification to the Internal Revenue Service required under Section 1.897  2(h)(2) of the United States Treasury Regulations.   

 6.7 Indemnification of Officers and Directors of Target and its Subsidiaries.    

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Target and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Target and the equivalent organization documents of its Subsidiaries as each is in effect on the date of this Agreement (the persons entitled to be indemnified pursuant to such provisions, and all other current and former directors and officers of Target and its Subsidiaries, being referred to collectively as the "Indemnified Parties"). Acquiror shall cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation from liability set forth in Targets articles of incorporation and bylaws on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party.    

 (b) Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.7(a), during the period ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Acquiror will indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to (i) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer or employee of Target or any of its Subsidiaries (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date) or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided _,_ however, that if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to Acquiror a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this Section 6.7(b), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the    ##### 

 

sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is
fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, (i) Acquiror will have the right to control the
defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by
electing to control the defense thereof, Acquiror will be deemed to have
waived any right to object to the Indemnified Parties entitlement to
indemnification hereunder with respect thereto), (ii) any counsel retained by
the Indemnified Parties with respect to the defense thereof for any period
after the Effective Time must be reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror, and
(iii) after the Effective Time, Acquiror will pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received
(provided that in the event of a final non-appealable judicial determination
that any Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder, any
amounts advanced on his or her behalf shall be remitted to the Surviving
Corporation); provided, however, that neither Acquiror nor the Surviving
Corporation, nor any Indemnified Party, will be liable for any settlement
effected without its, his or her express written consent. The Indemnified
Parties as a group may retain only one law firm (in addition to local
counsel) to represent them with respect to any single action unless counsel
for any Indemnified Party determines in good faith that, under applicable
standards of professional conduct, a conflict exists or is reasonably likely
to arise on any material issue between the positions of any two or more
Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section 6.7(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement, Acquiror shall not settle
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this Section
6.7 unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes
an unconditional release of all Indemnified Parties from all liability
arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.    

 (c) Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation jointly and severally agree to pay all expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the Indemnified Parties in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in this Section 6.7.    

 (d) Any payment required to be made pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall bear interest at the rate of 8% per annum since (and including) the day such payment first becomes due until the day of payment.    

 (e) This Section 6.7 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and the Effective Time, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Indemnified Parties, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation.

 (e) Other Antitrust Laws. If Acquiror reasonably determines that an antitrust filing under any antitrust law of a country other than the U.S. or Germany is required in connection with the Merger, and if the consummation of the Merger prior to the expiration or    ##### 

 

termination of the applicable waiting period under such antitrust law would
be illegal and would be reasonably likely to result in material harm to the
combined business of Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and Acquirors other
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, then such waiting period shall have expired or
been terminated.    

 (f) No Injunctions or Restraints; Illegality. No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by any non-U.S. court of competent jurisdiction shall have been issued and remain in effect, nor shall there be any non-U.S. statute, rule or regulation enacted or deemed applicable to the Merger, that makes the consummation of the Merger illegal, except where the contravention of any such order, statute, rule or regulation is not reasonably likely to result in material harm to the combined business of Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and Acquirors other Subsidiaries taken as a whole.    

 (g) No U.S. or German Governmental Litigation. There shall not be pending before any court of competent jurisdiction any legal proceeding commenced by a U.S. federal or state Governmental Entity or German Governmental Entity that is likely to result in a judgment in favor of such Governmental Entity and that: (i) challenges or seeks to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger; (ii) relates to the Merger and seeks to obtain from Acquiror any damages or other relief that, if awarded, would have a material adverse effect on Acquiror and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation), taken as a whole; (iii) seeks to prohibit or limit in any material respect Acquirors ability to vote, receive dividends with respect to or otherwise exercise ownership rights with respect to the stock of the Surviving Corporation; or (iv) would materially and adversely affect the right of the Surviving Corporation to continue to operate the Current Target Business.

 (a) by the mutual written consent of Acquiror and Target;

 (c) by either Acquiror or Target if a court of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a nonappealable final and permanent injunction having the effect of permanently prohibiting the Merger;

 9. Escrow and Indemnification   

 9.1 Escrow Fund.    

 (a) At the Closing, Acquiror shall withhold, from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.6(a) to the holders of Target Common Stock, and shall deposit into an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (or such other institution jointly designated by Acquiror and the Shareholders Agent) as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent") on behalf of such holders, an amount equal to the sum of (a) $1,500,000 _plus_ (b) the product of 10% of the Per Share Price _multiplied by_ the number of shares of Target Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Dissenting Shares). The Escrow Fund shall be governed by the terms set forth in the Escrow Agreement and shall be available (i) to indemnify Acquiror pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Section 9, and (ii) to make the payments referred to in Sections 2.13(c)(v), 2.13(d)(ii), 2.14, 9.1(b), 9.2(d) and 9.3.    

 (b) On the first business day after the Adjusted Working Capital Amount is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.13, Acquiror and the Shareholders Agent shall be obligated to instruct the Escrow Agent to (i) pay to Acquiror or the Shareholders Agent, as applicable, in immediately available funds from the Escrow Fund, any amounts due pursuant to Sections 2.13(c)(v), 2.13(d)(ii) and 2.14, and (ii) pay to each Former Shareholder, in immediately available funds from the Escrow Fund, a dollar amount equal to such Former Shareholders Pro Rata Portion of the amount, if any, by which $1,500,000 exceeds the sum of all amounts withdrawn by Acquiror and the Shareholders Agent pursuant to Sections 2.13(c)(v), 2.13(d)(ii) and 2.14. On the first business day following the Representation Termination Date, Acquiror and the Shareholders Agent shall be obligated to instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to each Former Shareholder, in immediately available funds from the Escrow Fund, a dollar amount equal to such Former Shareholders Pro Rata Portion of the aggregate amount then held in the Escrow Fund (with an appropriate reserve to cover pending and unresolved claims).   

 9.2 Indemnification.    

 (a) Expiration of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. All representations and warranties made by Target in this Agreement or in the Target Closing Certificate shall expire on the date 455 days after the Closing Date (the "Representation Termination Date"); provided _,_ however _,_ that if at any time prior to the Representation Termination Date, Acquiror delivers to the Shareholders Agent a notice stating the existence of an inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made by Target or a breach of a covenant made by Target (and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for Acquirors determination that such an inaccuracy or breach exists and the amount of the Damages incurred by Acquiror as a result of such inaccuracy or breach) and asserting a claim for recovery under this Section 9.2 based on such inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the Representation Termination Date until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. All obligations of the parties under the covenants contained herein (including the covenants set forth in Sections 5 and 6) shall expire at the Effective Time, except to the extent that any such covenant expressly specifies that it is to be (or is otherwise required by this Agreement to be) performed after the Effective Time; provided, however, that notwithstanding    ##### 

 

the expiration of the parties obligations under such covenants, claims for
breaches of any covenants of Target prior to their expiration may be brought
after the Effective Time and until the Representation Termination
Date.    

 (b) Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 9.2(a) and 9.2(c) and the other limitations set forth in this Agreement, from and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall be entitled to be indemnified, solely from the Escrow Fund, against any Damages actually incurred by Acquiror as a result of (i) any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Target set forth in Section 0 or in the Target Closing Certificate, and (ii) the breach of any covenant of Target in this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 9, "Damages" shall mean any liabilities, losses, damages, penalties, fines, costs or expenses, including reasonable legal, expert and consultant fees and expenses, but excluding any special, indirect, consequential, exemplary and punitive damages and also excluding any damages associated with any lost profits or lost opportunities; provided, however, that for purposes of computing the amount of any Damages incurred by Acquiror: (i) there shall be deducted an amount equal to the amount of any Tax benefit actually received or receivable by Acquiror or any of its affiliates in connection with such Damages or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto; (ii) there shall be deducted an amount equal to the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements actually received or receivable by Acquiror or any of its affiliates in connection with such Damages or any of the circumstances giving rise thereto; and (iii) there shall be taken into account the amount of any reduction in the aggregate cash amount payable to Targets shareholders arising from the operation of Section 2.13 or Section 2.14.    

 (c) Limitations of Liability.    

 (i) The right of Acquiror to be indemnified from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Section 9 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Target contained in, or any other breach by Target of, this Agreement or the Target Closing Certificate. Subject to Section 9.2(c)(iv), no current or former shareholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate or advisor of Target shall have any personal or individual liability of any nature to Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in, or any other breach of, this Agreement or the Target Closing Certificate. The parties acknowledge that (A) except as set forth in the Shareholder Agreements, no current or former stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate or advisor of Target has made or is making any representations, warranties or commitments whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied, (B) except as expressly provided in Section 3 or in the Target Closing Certificate, Target has not made and is not making any representations, warranties or commitments whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied, and (C) except as expressly provided in Section 3, in the Target Closing Certificate and in the Shareholder Agreements, Acquiror is not relying and has not relied on, any representations, warranties or commitments whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied.    

 (ii) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this Section 9, the indemnification provided for in this Section 9.2 shall not apply,    ##### 

 

and Acquiror shall not be entitled to exercise any indemnification rights
under this Agreement, except to the extent that the aggregate amount of the
Damages against which Acquiror would otherwise be entitled to be indemnified
under this Section 9.2 exceeds $1,000,000. If the aggregate amount of such
Damages exceeds $1,000,000, then Acquiror shall, subject to the
other limitations contained herein, be entitled to be indemnified from the
Escrow Fund only against the portion of such Damages in excess of
$250,000.    

 (iii) Without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this Section 9, for purposes of this Agreement, no representation or warranty of Target shall be deemed to be or to have been inaccurate if: (A) Acquiror had specific knowledge, on or prior to the date of this Agreement, of the inaccuracy of such representation or warranty; or (B) during the Pre-Closing Period, (1) Acquiror obtained specific knowledge of the inaccuracy of such representation or warranty, (2) such inaccuracy, considered together with all other inaccuracies of any representations or warranties of which Acquiror had specific knowledge, was of a nature that would have caused the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) not to be satisfied and (3) Acquiror elected nonetheless to proceed with the Closing.    

 (iv) Nothing in this Section 9.2(c) shall limit any remedy Acquiror may have against any person for fraud under applicable tort laws or for breaches of representations and warranties in the Shareholder Agreements.    

 (d) Defense of Third-Party Claims. Promptly after Acquiror obtains knowledge of any actual or possible claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration, investigation, inquiry or proceeding that has been or may be brought or asserted by a third party against Acquiror or any of Acquirors Subsidiaries or other affiliates and that may be subject to indemnification hereunder (a "Third-Party Claim"), Acquiror shall promptly give notice of such Third-Party Claim to the Shareholders Agent, stating the nature and basis of such Third-Party Claim and the dollar amount of such Third-Party Claim, to the extent known. The Shareholders Agent shall have the right at its election, at any time, to defend any Third-Party Claim, in which case: (i) Shareholders Agent shall diligently and in good faith defend such Third-Party Claim; (ii) the attorneys fees of counsel reasonably acceptable to Acquiror (approval of such counsel not to be unreasonably withheld), other professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs incurred by the Shareholders Agent in connection with defending such Third-Party Claim shall be payable from the Escrow Fund, without the requirement of any consent or approval by Acquiror; (iii) Acquiror shall not be entitled to be indemnified (from the Escrow Fund or otherwise) for any costs or expenses incurred by Acquiror in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim; (iv) Acquiror shall be entitled to monitor such defense at its expense; (v) Acquiror shall make available to the Shareholders Agent all books, records and other documents and materials that are under the direct or indirect control of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or other affiliates and that the Shareholders Agent considers necessary or desirable for the defense of such Third-Party Claim; (vi) Acquiror shall execute such documents and take such other actions as the Shareholders Agent may reasonably request for the purpose of facilitating the defense of, or any settlement, compromise or adjustment relating to, such Third-Party Claim; (vii) Acquiror shall otherwise fully cooperate as reasonably requested by the Shareholders Agent in the defense of such Third-Party Claim; (viii) Acquiror shall not admit any liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim; and (ix) the Shareholders Agent shall not    ##### 

 

enter into any settlement agreement providing for the settlement of such
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of Acquiror (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) if such settlement agreement
imposes on Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or other affiliates any
obligation, other than an obligation to pay monetary damages in an amount
less than the aggregate cash amount remaining in the Escrow Fund
and available to pay such damages. If the Shareholders Agent elects not to
defend such Third-Party Claim, then (i) Acquiror shall diligently defend
such Third-Party Claim and (ii) Acquiror shall have no right to seek
indemnification under this Section 9 in respect of such Third-Party Claim for
any settlement entered into without the prior written consent of the
Shareholders Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.    

 (e) Subrogation. To the extent that Acquiror is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 9, the Shareholders Agent shall be entitled to exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of recovery) that Acquiror or any of Acquirors Subsidiaries or other affiliates may have against any other person with respect to any Damages, circumstances or matter to which such indemnification is directly or indirectly related. Acquiror shall permit the Shareholders Agent to use the name of Acquiror and its affiliates in any transaction or in any proceeding or other matter involving any of such rights or remedies, and Acquiror shall take such actions as the Shareholders Agent may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling the Shareholders Agent to perfect or exercise the right of subrogation of the Shareholders Agent under this Section 9.2(e).   

 9.3 Shareholders Agent.    

 (a) By virtue of the approval of this Agreement by Targets shareholders, and without further action of any Target shareholder, each Former Shareholder shall be deemed to have irrevocably constituted and appointed Richard P. Haugland (and by execution of this Agreement he hereby accepts such appointment) as agent and attorney-in-fact ("Shareholders Agent") for and on behalf of the Former Shareholders, with full power of substitution, to act in the name, place and stead of each Former Shareholder with respect to this Section 9 and the Escrow Agreement and the taking by the Shareholders Agent of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Shareholders Agent under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including the exercise of the power to: (i) give and receive notices and communications under this Section 9 or the Escrow Agreement; (ii) prepare and deliver to Acquiror the Agents Working Capital Statement and participate on behalf of the Former Shareholders in the resolution of any dispute relating thereto; (iii) authorize delivery to Acquiror of cash from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims for indemnification made by Acquiror under this Section 9; (iv) object to claims for indemnification made by Acquiror under this Section 9; (v) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to claims for indemnification made by Acquiror under this Section 9; and (vi) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of the Shareholders Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The power of attorney granted in this Section 9.3 is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable, may be delegated by the Shareholders Agent and shall survive the death or incapacity of any Former Shareholder. The identity of the Shareholders Agent and the terms of the agency may be changed, and a successor    ##### 

 

Shareholders Agent may be appointed, from time to time (including in the
event of the death, disability or other incapacity of the Shareholders
Agent) by Former Shareholders whose aggregate Pro Rata Portions exceed 50%,
and any such successor shall succeed the Shareholders Agent as Shareholders
Agent hereunder. No bond shall be required of the Shareholders Agent, and
the Shareholders Agent shall receive no compensation for his
services.    

 (b) The Shareholders Agent shall not be liable for any liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred without gross negligence by the Shareholders Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of his reasonable judgment and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith). The Escrow Fund shall be available to indemnify and hold the Shareholders Agent harmless against any liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred by the Shareholders Agent without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Shareholders Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Shareholders Agent shall be entitled to recover any out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Shareholders Agent in connection with actions taken by the Shareholders Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (including the hiring of legal counsel and the incurring of legal fees and costs) from the Escrow Fund, without the requirement of any consent or approval by Acquiror.    

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the Shareholders Agent with reasonable access to information about the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of the officers and employees of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation for purposes of performing his duties and exercising his rights under this Agreement, provided that the Shareholders Agent shall treat confidentially any nonpublic information he receives from Acquiror regarding the Surviving Corporation (except in connection with the performance by the Shareholders Agent of his duties or the exercise of his rights under this Agreement).    

 (d) The Shareholders Agent shall be entitled to no compensation for his service in such capacity.   

 9.4 Actions of the Shareholders Agent. From and after the Effective Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders Agent shall constitute a decision of all Former Shareholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Former Shareholder, and the Escrow Agent and Acquiror may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each Former Shareholder. Acquiror and Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by Shareholders Agent and any acts done by Acquiror or Surviving Corporation in accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders Agent.    #####

 10.3 Target Disclosure Schedule.

 10.7 Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.2(c) or elsewhere herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity    #####

preclude the exercise of any other remedy.   

 10.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Oregon applicable to parties residing in the State of Oregon, without regard to applicable principles of conflicts of law. Each of the parties irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California, in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and agrees that process may be served upon it in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of California for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which it might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process.

 10.9 Rules of Construction.    

 (a) The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

 10.10 Time is of the Essence; Enforcement. Time is of the essence of this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.    #####
