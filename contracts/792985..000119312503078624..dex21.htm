1.2 _Purchase Price_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the aggregate purchase price to be paid by Purchaser to Seller for the
purchase of the Assets shall be (a) Five Hundred Fifteen Million Dollars
($515,000,000.00) (the "Purchase Price"), _plus or minus_ (b) the amount of
Net Working Capital (as defined below) on the Closing Date, _minus_ (c) the
amount of Sellers capital lease obligations with respect to the Hospitals on
the Closing Date, if any, that are assumed by Purchaser pursuant to Section
1.11 of this Agreement, _minus_ (d) the amount of TRHs capital lease
obligations with respect to the TRH Businesses on the Closing Date, _minus_
(e) the product of the Usage Percentage and the Sick Pay Amount on the
Closing Date (the sum of (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) being referred to for
purposes of this Agreement as the "Cash Purchase Price"). The payment of the
Cash Purchase Price at Closing shall be governed by Section 1.7.



For purposes of this Agreement, "Net Working Capital" shall be defined as an
amount equal to the difference between the (i) current assets of Seller and
TRH with respect to the operation of the Hospitals, which for purposes of this
calculation shall include only (A) the value of the Prepaids (including
prepaids of the TRH Businesses), (B) the value of the Inventory (including
inventory items of the TRH Businesses) and (C) other current assets associated
with the Hospitals to the extent they have value and do not
constitute Excluded Assets, and (ii) the current liabilities of Seller and
TRH which are payable to third parties with respect to the operation of the
Hospitals, which for purposes of this calculation shall only include (A)
Accounts Payable (excluding credit balances of patient accounts receivable to
the extent included therein), (B) Accrued Expenses, (C) Accrued Payroll, (D)
Accrued Paid Time Off (including, without limitation, CashPlus), and (E) Other
Current Liabilities (as such terms are utilized on the Interim Balance Sheet
and the Final Balance Sheet); provided, however, the term "Net Working
Capital" shall not include any liabilities arising under the Seller Plans
(other than for Accrued Paid Time Off). For purposes of this Agreement,
"Usage Percentage" shall be defined as the percentage set forth on Schedule
1.2-a. For purposes of this Agreement, "Sick Pay Amount" shall be defined as
the amount of the accumulated sick pay and extended sick pay obligations of
Seller and/or its affiliates to the Hired Employees.



At least three (3) calendar days but no more than ten (10) calendar days prior
to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser the latest
available unaudited balance sheet (as of the end of a calendar month) of
Seller and TRH with respect to the operation of the Hospitals (the "Interim
Balance Sheet"). The Interim Balance Sheet shall include a calculation of Net
Working Capital, the amount of Sellers capital lease obligations with respect
to the Hospitals, if any, that are assumed by Purchaser pursuant to Section
1.11 of this Agreement, the amount of TRHs capital lease obligations with
respect to the TRH Businesses and the Sick Pay Amount. The Interim Balance
Sheet shall be attached hereto as Schedule 1.2-b. The amounts set forth in
the Interim Balance Sheet shall be subject to adjustment as provided in
Sections 1.3 and 1.4 below. 1.3 _Inventory_. Seller shall cause an inventory to be taken of the Inventory
(including inventory items of the TRH Businesses) by employees or
representatives of Seller or its affiliates, with said inventory to be taken
in accordance with Sellers and TRHs policies and procedures, as near in time
as possible to the Closing Date (but in no event more than ten (10) days
prior to the Closing Date) and with the results extended and adjusted through
the Closing Date. Seller shall permit representatives or employees of
Purchaser to observe such inventory process. The cost of conducting the
inventory shall be borne by Seller. All inventory items shall be valued at the
lesser of cost or current market value. The parties acknowledge that the
inventory to be taken pursuant to this Section 1.3 will not be conducted
until immediately prior to the Closing Date and, as such, the results of such
inventory will not be available until some time after the Closing Date.
Accordingly, the parties agree that for purposes of the Interim Balance Sheet,
Net Working Capital shall include the book value of the Inventory (including
inventory items of the TRH Businesses) with respect to the operation of the
Hospitals as reflected by the latest available unaudited balance sheet (as of
the end of a calendar month) of Seller and TRH. For purposes of the Final
Balance Sheet, the portion of Net Working Capital attributable to the
Inventory (including inventory items of the TRH Businesses) shall be the value
of the Inventory (including inventory items of the TRH Businesses)
as determined pursuant to this Section 1.3.



1.4 _Post-Closing Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Within one hundred eighty
(180) calendar days after the Closing Date, the final unaudited balance sheet
of the Hospitals as of the Closing Date (the "Final Balance Sheet"), which
shall include a calculation of Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date,
the amount of Sellers capital lease obligations with respect to the Hospitals
on the Closing Date, if any, that are assumed by Purchaser pursuant to Section
1.11 of this Agreement, the amount of TRHs capital lease obligations with
respect to the TRH Businesses on the Closing Date and the Sick Pay Amount,
shall be prepared by Seller and delivered to Purchaser. The Interim Balance
Sheet and the Final Balance Sheet shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the terms of Section 2.10. If Purchaser disputes any entry on the Final
Balance Sheet that affects the calculation of Net Working Capital, the capital
lease obligations assumed by Purchaser, the capital lease obligations of TRH
or the Sick Pay Amount, Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing (which
writing shall contain Purchasers determination of the amount of the disputed
entry) within twenty (20) business days after Purchasers receipt of the
Final Balance Sheet from Seller. If Purchaser and Seller cannot resolve such
dispute within thirty (30) business days after Purchaser notifies Seller in
writing of such dispute, then PricewaterhouseCoopers, independent certified
public accountants (the "Independent Auditor"), shall review the matter in
dispute and, solely as to disputes relating to accounting issues and acting as
an expert and not as an arbitrator, shall promptly decide the proper amounts
of such disputed entries (which decision shall also include a final
recalculation of the Cash Purchase Price). In the event that all or a portion
of the dispute at issue involves a legal issue or an interpretation of this
Agreement, such legal or interpretative dispute shall first be subject to
adjudication by a court or similar tribunal, with any necessary review by the
Independent Auditor under this Section 1.4 occurring following the resolution
of such legal dispute. Such decision of the Independent Auditor shall be
conclusive and binding as between Purchaser and    Seller, and the costs of such review shall be borne by both Seller and
Purchaser in proportion to the relevant amount each partys determination
has been modified.



Within twenty-five (25) business days after Purchasers receipt of the Final
Balance Sheet from Seller or, if disputed by Purchaser, within five (5)
business days after the earlier of (a) the date Purchaser and Seller finally
resolve such dispute and recalculate the Cash Purchase Price accordingly, or
(b) the date of receipt of a decision from the Independent Auditor (the "Post-
Closing Adjustment Date"), either (i) Seller shall pay Purchaser in cash or in
other immediately available funds the amount of any decrease in the Cash
Purchase Price, or (ii) Purchaser shall pay Seller in cash or in other
immediately available funds the amount of any increase in the Cash Purchase
Price. If Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, shall fail to make such
payment to the other on the Post-Closing Adjustment Date, then the party
failing to receive such amount due to it shall be entitled to receive interest
on such unpaid amount at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate reported by
the Wall Street Journal under "Money Rates" (the "Prime Rate") on the Post-
Closing Adjustment Date plus two percent (2%) (or the maximum rate allowed by
law, whichever is less) from such defaulting party, such interest accruing on
each calendar day after the Post-Closing Adjustment Date until payment of
such amount and all interest thereon is made.



1.5 _Closing Date_. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement ("Closing") shall take place at 9:00 a.m. on October 31, 2003, at
the offices of McDermott, Will and Emery, 201 South Biscayne Boulevard, Miami,
Florida 33131 or such other date (which date shall be the last calendar day of
a month), time and place as the parties shall mutually agree ("Closing Date");
provided that all conditions precedent and other matters required to be
completed as of the Closing Date have been or will be completed on or before
such date. The Closing with respect to each Hospital, shall be deemed to have
occurred and to be effective as between the parties as of 12:01
a.m. (determined by reference to the local time zone in which such Hospital
is located) on the next day after the Closing Date (the "Effective Time").

solely responsible for all of Sellers debts, liabilities, contract
obligations, expenses, obligations and claims of any nature whatsoever related

TRH Businesses prior to the Effective Time, other than as specifically
included in the Assumed Obligations; and



(k) any other obligations and liabilities identified on Schedule 1.12(k).



1.13 _Disclaimer of Warranties_. Except as expressly set forth in Article 2
hereof, the Assets transferred to Purchaser will be sold by Seller and
purchased by Purchaser in their physical condition at the Effective Time, "
_AS IS, WHERE IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS AND NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS_ " _WITH NO
WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR HABITATION_ , with respect to the
Real Property, land, buildings and improvements, and _WITH NO WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE_ , with respect to the physical condition of the
Personal Property and Inventory, any and all of which warranties (both express
and implied) Seller hereby disclaims. All of the foregoing real and personal
property shall be further subject to normal wear and tear on the
land, buildings, improvements and equipment and normal and customary use of
the inventory and supplies in the ordinary course of business up to the
Effective Time. All of the foregoing provisions and disclaimers contained in
this Section 1.13 shall also be applicable to the assets comprising the TRH
Businesses. 1.14 _Risk of Loss_. The risk of loss or damage to any of the Assets, Personal
Property, Owned Real Property, the Hospitals and all other property, transfer
of which is contemplated by this Agreement, shall remain with Seller until the
Effective Time and Seller shall (and shall cause TRH to, as applicable)
maintain its insurance policies covering the Assets, Personal Property, Owned
Real Property, the Hospitals and all other property through the Effective
Time. References in Sections 1.10(q), 1.10(r) and this Section 1.14 to
"Assets", "Leased Real Property", "Owned Real Property" and "Real Property"
shall be interpreted as if such terms included the applicable underlying
assets of TRH.



(a) With respect to all Hospitals (including the Real Property and other
Assets related thereto) that are located in a single State (the States in
which the Hospitals are located being Florida, Tennessee and Missouri), if,
prior to the Closing, all or any part of one or more Hospitals located in a
State is destroyed or damaged by fire or the elements or by any other cause
where such damage or destruction is in the aggregate (the "Aggregate Damage")
less than twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price allocable to all the
Hospitals in such State as set forth on Schedule 1.14(a), the parties duties
and obligations under this Agreement shall not be affected and the Closing
shall proceed as scheduled; provided, however, Seller shall assign, transfer
and set over to Purchaser all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to
any insurance proceeds on account of such damage or destruction and, if such
insurance policy proceeds are insufficient to repair, restore and/or replace
the Hospital(s) or other affected Assets, the difference between the cost to
repair, restore and/or replace and the amount of such proceeds shall be
deducted from the Cash Purchase Price allocable to such Hospital as set forth
on Schedule 1.14(a). If prior to the Closing, all or any part of one or more
Hospitals located in a State is destroyed or damaged by fire or the elements
or by any other cause where the Aggregate Damage exceeds twenty percent (20%)
of the Purchase Price allocable to all the Hospitals in such State as set
forth on Schedule 1.14(a), Purchaser may elect to (i) purchase such
Hospitals, and the Closing shall proceed as scheduled (provided, however, at
the Closing Seller shall assign, transfer and set over to Purchaser all of
Sellers right, title and interest in and to any insurance proceeds on account
of such damage or destruction loss plus the amount of any deductibles under
such insurance policies) or (ii) terminate the Agreement as to all, but not
less than all, of the Hospitals located in such State by the delivery of a
written notice to Seller (the "Casualty Termination Notice"), and, in such
event, an appropriate adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made by
Purchaser and Seller, based upon the amounts set forth on Schedule 1.14(a). In
such latter event, the parties duties and obligations under this Agreement
with respect to Hospitals located in other States shall not be affected and
the Closing as to such Hospitals shall proceed as scheduled. If Purchaser and
Seller are unable to agree upon the amount of the Aggregate Damage, the
amount of the Aggregate Damage shall be determined by the Independent Auditor
pursuant to Section 1.14(c).



(b) If, prior to the Closing, all or any part of a parcel of the Real Property
is made subject to an eminent domain proceeding which would in Purchasers
reasonable judgment materially adversely impair access to the Real Property or
be materially adverse to the operation of the Hospitals, Purchaser may elect
to (i) purchase such affected Owned Real Property, or take assignment of such
Leased Real Property, and the Closing shall proceed as scheduled (provided,
however, at the Closing Seller shall assign, transfer and set over to
Purchaser all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to any award in
such eminent domain proceeding) or (ii) not purchase the affected Owned Real
Property, or not take assignment of such Leased Real Property, and, in such    event, an appropriate adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price shall be made by
Purchaser and Seller. If Purchaser and Seller are unable to agree upon
the amount of the adjustment described in subsection (ii) of the preceding
sentence by the Original Closing Date, the adjustment shall be resolved by the
Independent Auditor pursuant to Section 1.14(c).



(c) If pursuant to either Section 1.14(a) or 1.14(b), the amount of the
Aggregate Damage (and any applicable Cash Purchase Price adjustment) is to be
determined by the Independent Auditor, within fifteen (15) calendar days after
the occurrence of the damage to the Hospital at issue (the "Submittal Date"),
each party shall submit to the other party and to the Independent Auditor its
proposed Aggregate Damage (and any applicable Cash Purchase Price adjustment)
as a result of the event(s) contemplated by either Section 1.14(a) or
1.14(b), along with a detailed description of the basis for such amount and
any applicable adjustment. Within ten (10) calendar days after the Submittal
Date (the "Decision Date"), the Independent Auditor, acting as an expert and
not as an arbitrator, shall select either the Aggregate Damage (and any
applicable Cash Purchase Price adjustment) proposal of Seller or the Aggregate
Damage (and any applicable Cash Purchase Price adjustment) proposal of
Purchaser as the definitive amount of the Aggregate Damage (and any
applicable adjustment to the Cash Purchase Price). If the Aggregate Damage
exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price allocable to all the
Hospitals in such State as set forth on Schedule 1.14(a), Purchaser shall
thereafter have the right to terminate this Agreement with respect to the
Hospitals in such State by delivery of a Casualty Termination Notice to
Seller. If either Purchaser or Seller fails to timely provide its proposed
Aggregate Damage (and any applicable Cash Purchase Price adjustment) to the
Independent Auditor, the Aggregate Damage (and any applicable Cash Purchase
Price adjustment) shall be the amount proposed by the submitting party and,
provided that the Aggregate Damage exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the
Purchase Price allocable to all the Hospitals in such State as set forth on
Schedule 1.14(a), Purchaser shall thereafter have the right to provide a
Casualty Termination Notice and terminate this Agreement with respect to the
Hospitals in the State with respect to which the event occurred. If neither
party submits its proposed Aggregate Damage (and any applicable Cash Purchase
Price adjustment) to the Independent Auditor, no adjustment to the Cash
Purchase Price shall be made and Purchaser shall not have the right to
provide a Casualty Termination Notice. The decision of the Independent Auditor
shall be conclusive and binding as between Purchaser and Seller, and the costs
of such review shall be borne by the party whose proposed Aggregate Damage
(and any applicable Cash Purchase Price adjustment) is not selected by the
Independent Auditor. Upon any such determination of the adjustment to the Cash
Purchase Price in accordance with this Section 1.14, the parties shall,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at a mutually agreeable time and
place, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If pursuant to
either Section 1.14(a) or 1.14(b), the amount of the Aggregate Damage (and
any applicable Cash Purchase Price adjustment) is to be determined by the
Independent Auditor and either the Submittal Date or the Decision Date falls
on a day which is on or after the Termination Date or the Extended
Termination Date, as applicable, then the Termination Date or the Extended
Termination Date, as applicable, shall be extended to the date which is ten
(10) days after the Decision Date. 1.15 _State-by-State Staggered Closings_



(a) As contemplated by Sections 4.7 and 5.1 of this Agreement, respectively,
if a single Closing of all the Hospitals does not occur on or before October
31, 2003, Seller and Purchaser shall use reasonable commercial efforts to
cause the conditions set forth in Articles 6 and 7 to be satisfied on
a state-by-state basis.



(b) In the event a single Closing of all the Hospitals has not occurred by
October 31, 2003 (as contemplated by Section 1.15(a) above), and if all
conditions precedent to the obligations of Seller and Purchaser contained in
Articles 6 and 7, respectively, with respect to all the Hospitals that are
located within a single state, as identified on Schedule 1.15(b) (each, a
"State System"), have been met, performed or fulfilled, Seller and Purchaser
shall each be obligated to consummate the purchase of such State System at a
Closing in accordance with and subject to this Section 1.15 (each, a "State
System Closing"), without regard to whether all conditions precedent with
respect to the Hospitals attributable to other State Systems are at such time
satisfied or waived. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that there
may be two (2) or more State System Closings at which the Assets attributable
to different States are transferred to Purchaser.



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement, in the event of a State System Closing, this Section 1.15(c) shall
apply to such Closing, and govern the parties respective rights and
obligations under the Agreement;



(i) If and to the extent there is a State System Closing, any and all
references in this Agreement to the defined term "Closing" shall be deemed to
refer to such State System Closing, and the defined terms "Closing Date" and
"Effective Time" shall be deemed to refer to the date on (the "State System
Closing Date"), and time at, which such State System Closing occurs. Any and
all references in this Agreement to defined terms relating to assets to be
transferred (or excluded) or liabilities to be assumed (or excluded) in
connection with the Closing including, without limitation, "Assets," "Excluded
Assets," "Assumed Obligations", and "Excluded Liabilities", shall be deemed to
refer only to the assets or liabilities that are part of the State System to
be transferred (or excluded, as the case may be) at such State System Closing.
Except to the extent this Section 1.15(c) expressly indicates to the contrary,
any and all references to the rights and obligations of, or actions to be
taken by, either party in connection with the Closing shall be deemed to refer
to rights and obligations held, or actions to be taken, in connection with a
State System Closing, but only with reference to the Hospitals that are
subject to such State System Closing;



(ii) The post-Closing adjustment process relating to Net Working Capital that
is set forth in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of the Agreement shall apply separately
with respect to each State System Closing, and the Hospitals to be
transferred (or excluded) at such State System Closing, in accordance with the
principles of this Section 1.15(c) set forth immediately above;



(iii) In the event of a State System Closing, the portion of the Cash Purchase
Price payable under Section 1.7.1 at such State System Closing (subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 1.2 with respect to such State System Closing)
shall be determined based    upon the relative EBITDA contributions for the State Systems as described in
Schedule 1.15(c) attached hereto;



(iv) As contemplated by Section 1.15(c)(i) above, and the principles set
forth therein, (x) Seller and Purchaser shall be deemed to remake, as of the
applicable State System Closing Date, all of the representations and
warranties of such party that are set forth in Articles 2 and 3 of this
Agreement, respectively, with respect to the Hospitals being transferred as
of such State System Closing Date, and (y) Seller and Purchaser shall be
deemed to make and be bound by all of the covenants of such party that are set
forth in Article 4 and 5 of this Agreement, respectively, with respect to the
Hospitals being transferred as of such State System Closing Date;



(v) Each of the conditions precedent set forth in Articles 6 and 7 shall be
interpreted to apply solely to the Hospitals to be transferred at the related
State System Closing (even if the literal language of a condition precedent is
not, by its terms, so limited);



(vi) This Agreement may be terminated,



(A) in its entirety ( _i.e._ , as to the purchase by Purchaser of all State
Systems as to which no Closing has then occurred) at any time prior to the
last State System Closing under the circumstances set forth in Section 8.1
(a), (b), (c) and (e) (with the circumstances set forth in Section 8.1(e)
being interpreted to include all Hospitals, including the Hospitals which
have been the subject of any prior State System Closing); provided, however,
if a State System Closing has previously occurred and Purchaser provides
Seller with a written notice of breach of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(c) or Seller provides Purchaser with a written notice of breach of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b), Seller or Purchaser, as appropriate,
shall have the right, by providing written notice to the other, to (I) extend
the fifteen (15) business day cure period set forth in Section 8.1(b) or
Section 8.1(c), as appropriate, up to an additional sixty (60) calendar days
and (II) extend the Termination Date and the Extended Termination Date up to
an additional sixty (60) calendar days;



(B) in accordance with Section 8.1(f), with respect to any specific State
System as to which no State System Closing has yet occurred; __



(C) solely with respect to the Hospitals in a single State, upon the delivery
of a Casualty Termination Notice to Seller in accordance with Section 1.14;



(vii) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1,



(A) as modified by Section 1.15(c)(vi)(A), Section 8.2 shall be applied in
the manner described therein, or



(B) with respect to any specific State System, as contemplated by Section
1.15(vi)(C), Section 8.2 shall apply as to those rights and obligations of
the parties that were attributable to the State System subject to such
termination;



(viii) For purposes of Section 10.1 of this Agreement, the survival period of
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and indemnifications of
Purchaser and Seller that are attributable to one or more State Systems transferred on a
State System Closing Date shall be measured from such State System Closing
Date; and



(x) For purposes of Section 10.2 and 10.3 of this Agreement, in the event of
one or more State System Closings, the limitations on Sellers and Purchasers
liability thereunder shall be unaffected, except that (A) the maximum
aggregate liability of Seller to Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.2.2(b),
subject to any exceptions set forth therein, shall not exceed the actual
aggregate Cash Purchase Price with respect to all State System Closings
(as thereafter adjusted pursuant to Section 1.4) and (B) the maximum
aggregate liability of Purchaser to Seller pursuant to Section 10.3.2(b),
subject to any exceptions set forth therein, shall not exceed, subsequent to
Purchaser paying the actual Cash Purchase Price at each State System Closing
(as thereafter adjusted pursuant to Section 1.4), an additional amount equal
to the actual aggregate Cash Purchase Price with respect to all State System
Closings (as thereafter adjusted pursuant to Section 1.4).

contemplated by this Agreement.



3.10 _Purchaser Knowledge_. References in this Agreement to "Purchasers
knowledge or "the best knowledge of Purchaser" mean the actual knowledge of
the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating
Officer of Purchaser without independent investigation. No constructive or
imputed knowledge shall be attributed to any such individual by virtue of any
position held, relationship to any other Person or for any other reason.



3.11 _Investment Representation_. Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for its
own account, for investment purposes only and with no present intention of
distributing or reselling such interest or any part thereof. Purchaser
acknowledges and understands that the Shares will not be registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), or under any other applicable
blue sky or state securities law on the grounds that the offering and sale of
the Shares are exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act
and exempt from registration pursuant to comparable available
exemptions under applicable state securities laws, and that Sellers reliance
on such exemption is predicated in part upon the representations and
warranties of Purchaser set forth in this Section 3.11. Purchaser acknowledges
and understands that the  Shares must be held indefinitely unless the Shares are subsequently registered
under the Act and other applicable blue sky and state securities laws or
unless exemption from such registration is available. Purchaser (a) has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in the Shares;
(b) has the ability to bear the economic risk of the investment, including a
complete loss of the investment; (c) is an accredited investor within the
definition set forth in Rule 501(a) promulgated under the Act; and (d) has
been furnished with and has had access to such information as it has
considered necessary to make a determination as to the purchase of the Shares.

4.1 _Access and Information; Inspections_. From the Effective Date through the
Effective Time, Seller shall (and shall cause TRH to) afford to the officers
and agents of Purchaser (which shall include accountants, attorneys, bankers
and other consultants and agents of Purchaser) full and complete access during
normal business hours to and the right to inspect the plants, properties,
books, accounts, records and all other relevant documents and information
with respect to the assets, liabilities and business of the Hospitals. From
the Effective Date through the Effective Time, Seller shall (and shall cause
TRH to) furnish Purchaser with such additional financial and operating data
and other information in Sellers and TRHs possession as to businesses and
properties of the Hospitals as Purchaser or its representatives may from time

located. Purchasers right of access and inspection shall be exercised in
such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operations of the
Hospitals. Such access may include consultations with the personnel of Seller
and TRH; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not consult with or contact
in any manner any physicians on the medical staff at any of the Hospitals
without Sellers prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably
withheld. Further, Purchaser may, at its sole cost and expense (except as
otherwise provided in Section 12.12), undertake environmental, mechanical and
structural surveys of the Hospitals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all access
and inspection activities contemplated by this Section 4.1 shall be subject
to the prior reasonable approval of Seller (which approval may only be granted
by David R. Mayeux or his designee).

operation of the Hospitals:



(a) carry on its respective businesses with respect to the operation of the
Hospitals in substantially the same manner as presently conducted and not

Businesses), enter into any new contract or commitment, or incur or agree to
incur any liability, except in the ordinary course of business (which ordinary
course of business shall include renewals of any Contract, including any

such contract, commitment or liability as to which the total to be paid in
the future under the contract, commitment or liability exceeds Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($25,000).



(b) increase compensation payable or to become payable or make any bonus
payment to or otherwise enter into one or more bonus agreements with any
employee, except in the ordinary course of business in accordance with

Section 4.3(b) shall not apply to (i) agreements or arrangements with any of
the CEOs, CFOs, COOs or CNOs (collectively, the "Leadership Team") which are
consistent with the practices of the affiliates of Seller or TRH, or (ii) any
non-recurring payments or proposed non-recurring payments by Seller, TRH or
any affiliate of Seller to any of the Hospitals Employees (including any
member of the Leadership Team) to provide an incentive to such Hospitals
Employees (or to any member of the Leadership Team) to remain employed at the
Hospitals through the Closing;



(c) create, assume or permit to exist any new debt, mortgage, deed of trust,
pledge or other lien or encumbrance upon any of the Assets or the assets
comprising the TRH Businesses whether now owned or hereafter acquired;



(d) acquire (whether by purchase or lease) or sell, assign, lease, or
otherwise transfer or dispose of any property, plant or equipment, except in
the ordinary course of business with comparable replacement thereof; (e) except with respect to previously budgeted expenditures which are

Purchasers prior written consent to undertake the actions otherwise
prohibited by this Section 4.3 if Seller gives Purchaser written notice of a
proposed action and Seller does not receive from Purchaser a written notice of
objection to such action within five (5) business days after Purchaser
receives Sellers written notice.

promptly as practicable, all material Governmental Authorizations required of
Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) provide such

Governmental Entities may reasonably request; and (iii) cooperate with
Purchaser in Purchasers obtaining, as soon as practicable, all material

letters, clearances and other authorizations, consents and approvals of any
Governmental Entity which are required to consummate any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or to operate the Hospitals as currently operated under
any law, including provider agreements with the Medicare and Medicaid
programs.



4.5 _Additional Financial Information_. Within thirty (30) calendar
days following the end of each calendar month prior to Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Purchaser complete copies of the unaudited balance sheet and
related unaudited statements of income relating to Seller and TRH with respect
to the operation of the Hospitals for each month then ended, together with
corresponding year-to-date amounts, which presentation shall be consistent
with the provisions of Section 2.10 which are applicable to the Financial
Statements (other than the Audited Statements or the Reviewed Statements).



4.6 _No-Shop_.



(a) From and after the Effective Date until the earlier of the Closing Date
or the termination of this Agreement, Seller shall not (and shall cause TRH to
not) and shall cause its respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, investment bankers
or agents to not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser: (i) offer

looking toward such an offer or solicitation; or (iv) enter into any agreement
with any party (other than Purchaser) with respect to the sale or other
disposition of any of the Hospitals, the Assets or the assets comprising the
TRH Businesses, or any portion of the capital stock of any Seller, whether by
merger, consolidation, tender offer or otherwise. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 4.6 shall not be construed to prohibit Seller, TRH or
its affiliates from engaging in corporate transactions involving Sellers,
TRHs or Sellers affiliates stock or securities, including macro-level
mergers, reorganizations or other transactions, so long as the terms thereof
do not contemplate the sale or lease or other disposition of the Hospitals,
the Assets or the assets comprising the TRH Businesses. 



(b) Any reference in this Agreement to an "affiliate" shall mean any Person
directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with
a second Person; provided, however, an "affiliate" shall not include the
stockholders of THC or any officer or director of any Person. The term
"control" (including the terms "controlled by" and "under common control
with") means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or
cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person, whether
through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. A
"Person" shall mean any natural person, partnership, corporation, limited
liability company, association, trust or other legal entity.



4.7 _Seller s Efforts to Close_. Seller shall use its reasonable commercial
efforts to satisfy all of the conditions precedent set forth in Articles 6 and
7 to its or Purchasers obligations under this Agreement to the extent that
Sellers action or inaction can control or influence the satisfaction of such
conditions so that a single Closing with respect to all of the Hospitals will
occur no later than October 31, 2003. In the event that a Closing with respect
to all of the Hospitals does not occur on or before October 31, 2003, Seller
shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to satisfy all of the conditions
precedent set forth in Articles 6 and 7 to its or Purchasers obligations
under this Agreement on a state-by-state basis, to the extent that Sellers
action or inaction can control or influence the satisfaction of such
conditions, so that the parties may consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with respect to all of the Hospitals that are attributable
to any single state at the earliest possible opportunity, subject to Section
1.5 (including without limitation that Closing shall occur on the last
calendar day of a month).



4.8 _Title Matters_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser (a) a preliminary binder or title commitment(s) (the "Title
Commitment") sufficient for the issuance of an A.L.T.A. Extended Coverage
Owners Title Insurance Policy with respect to the Owned Real Property (the
"Owners Title Policy") and an A.L.T.A Extended Coverage Leasehold Title
Policy with respect to any ground lease specified on Schedule 4.8 (the
"Leasehold Title Policy") (the Owners Title Policy and the Leasehold Title
Policy are collectively referred to in this Agreement  as the "Title Policy"), issued by Chicago Title Insurance Company (the "Title
Company"), together with true, correct and legible copies of all instruments
referred to therein as conditions or exceptions to title (the "Title
Instruments") and (b) A.L.T.A. surveys of the Owned Real Property complying
with the Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ASCM Land Title
Surveys for the Owned Real Property (the "Surveys"). Section 12.12 shall
govern which party or parties hereto shall bear the costs and expenses of the
Title Commitment, the Title Policy and the Surveys. References in this
Section 4.8 to "Owned Real Property" shall be interpreted as if such term
included the owned real property assets of TRH.



 

4.9 _Termination of Hospitals  Employees_. Upon the Effective Time, the
Hospitals Employees (other than the Retained Management Employees) shall
cease to be employees of Seller and Sellers affiliates, and shall be removed
from such entities respective payrolls. Seller shall (and shall cause TRH to)
terminate effective as of the Effective Time the active participation of all
of the Hospitals Employees (other than the Retained Management Employees) and
the TRH Employees in all of the Seller Plans, and shall cause each Seller Plan
to comply with all applicable laws. After the Effective Time, Seller shall
timely make or cause to be made by Sellers affiliates appropriate
distributions to, or for the benefit of, all of the Hospitals Employees
(other than the Retained Management Employees) and the TRH Employees in
respect of the Seller Plans which are in force and effect with respect to the
Hospitals Employees (other than the Retained Management Employees) and the
TRH Employees at the Hospitals immediately prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with ERISA, the Code and the terms and conditions of the Seller
Plans; provided, however, no such distribution shall be required to the extent
it is among the Assumed Obligations.



 

4.10 _Termination Cost Reports_. Seller shall file all Medicare, Medicaid,
Tricare, Blue Cross and any other termination cost reports required to be
filed as a result of the consummation of (a) the transfer of the Assets to
Purchaser and (b) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All such
termination cost reports shall be filed by Seller in a manner that is
consistent with current laws, rules and regulations. Seller will be solely
responsible, financially and otherwise, for the contents of all such
termination cost reports (and related claims and documentation). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller will be solely obligated for
all cost report deficiencies related to periods prior to the Effective Time.



4.11 _Hart-Scott-Rodino Act Filings_. Seller will (a) take promptly all
actions necessary to make the filings required of Seller or
Sellers affiliates under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "HSR Act"), (b)
comply at the earliest practicable date with any request for additional
information received by Seller or Sellers affiliates from the Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") or Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the
"DOJ") pursuant to the HSR Act, and (c) cooperate with Purchaser in
connection with Purchasers filings under the HSR Act and in connection with
resolving any investigation or other regulatory inquiry concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement commenced by either the FTC or the
DOJ. All fees and expenses of Seller incurred in connection with Sellers
filing under the HSR Act shall be borne by the parties in accordance with
Section 12.12.



4.12 _Environmental Survey_. Seller shall promptly obtain from an
environmental consulting firm (the "Consultant") a written
environmental survey of the Owned Real Property (the "Environmental Survey") and shall deliver the Environmental Survey to
Purchaser, which survey shall be identified on Exhibit 4.12 hereto. Section
12.12 shall govern which party or parties hereto shall bear the costs and
expenses of the Environmental Survey. Reference in this Section 4.12 to "Owned
Real Property" shall be interpreted as if such term included the owned real
property assets of TRH.



4.13  _Noncompetition_. As an inducement to Purchaser to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, neither
Seller nor any of Sellers affiliates, shall, for a period of five (5) years
following the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
directly or indirectly, invest in, own, manage, operate, control or
participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, any
Competing Business within the Seller Business Service Area. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Competing Business" means the business of owning and
operating general acute care hospitals. The term "Seller Business Service
Area" means either the County in which a Hospital is located or a twenty (20)
mile radius of such Hospital, whichever is the larger area, provided, however,
that the Hospitals set forth on Schedule 4.13 are not subject to this Section
4.13. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall be excluded from the
foregoing provisions of this Section 4.13: (a) the general acute care hospital
activities of Seller and Sellers affiliates as of the Closing Date (other
than the activities of the Hospitals), and (b) Sellers or any affiliate of
Sellers acquisition and operation of a general acute care hospital within the
Seller Business Service Area after the Closing Date so long as such hospital
was acquired in a transaction in which the amount of consideration allocated
to such hospital is less than twenty percent (20%) of the total consideration
necessary to consummate such transaction. Seller shall cause each of its
affiliates to comply with the obligations imposed by this Section 4.13. In the
event that the provisions contained in this Section 4.13 shall ever be deemed
to exceed the time or geographic limits or any other limitations permitted by
applicable law in any jurisdiction, then such provisions shall be deemed
reformed in such jurisdiction to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
law.



4.14 _Enforceability_. Seller hereby acknowledges that the restrictions
contained in Section 4.13 are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of Purchaser following the Closing Date. The parties also
hereby acknowledge and agree that any breach of Section 4.13 would result in
irreparable injury to Purchaser and that any remedy at law for any breach of
Section 4.13 would be inadequate. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the parties therefore agree, and Seller
hereby specifically consents that, without necessity of proof of actual
damage, Purchaser may be granted temporary or permanent injunctive relief,
that Purchaser shall be entitled to an equitable accounting of all earnings,
profits and other benefits arising from such breach, and that Purchaser shall
be entitled to recover its reasonable fees and expenses, including attorneys
fees, incurred by Purchaser in enforcing the restrictions contained in
Section 4.13.



4.15 _Estoppels and Contract Consents_. Seller shall use its reasonable
commercial good faith efforts to obtain the consent from the third party to
the AMIREIT Lease as described in Section 1.6.14, the receipt of which is a
condition to closing by virtue of Sellers obligation set forth in Section
1.6.14. Subject to the terms of Sections 5.10 and 9.3, Seller will use
reasonable commercial good faith efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing Date,
(a) estoppel letters, in a form reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, under all
Leases, and (b) consents from third parties under all Contracts and Leases
which, by the terms of such Contract or Lease, requires such consent. To the extent any of the consents described in Section 4.15(b) are not
obtained as of the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall use their reasonable
commercial good faith efforts to mitigate any costs, losses or damages
associated with the failure to obtain such consents prior to Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers obtaining of the estoppel
letters described in Section 4.15(a) and/or the consents described in Section
4.15(b) shall not be a condition precedent to either partys obligation to
close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.



ARTICLE 5



COVENANTS OF PURCHASER



5.1 _Purchaser s Efforts to Close_. Purchaser shall use its reasonable
commercial efforts to satisfy all of the conditions precedent set forth in
Articles 6 and 7 to its or Sellers obligations under this Agreement to the
extent that Purchasers action or inaction can control or influence
the satisfaction of such conditions so that a single Closing with respect to
all of the Hospitals will occur no later than October 31, 2003. In the event
that a Closing with respect to all of the Hospitals does not occur on or
before October 31, 2003, Purchaser shall use its reasonable commercial
efforts to satisfy all of the conditions precedent set forth in Articles 6 and
7 to its or Sellers obligations under this Agreement on a state-by-state
basis, to the extent that Purchasers action or inaction can control or
influence the satisfaction of such conditions, so that the parties may
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect to all
of the Hospitals that are attributable to any single state, at the earliest
possible opportunity, subject to Section 1.5 (including without limitation
that Closing shall occur on the last calendar day of a month).



5.2 _Required Governmental Approvals_. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Closing Date, Purchaser will: (i) use its reasonable commercial efforts
to obtain, as promptly as practicable, all material Governmental
Authorizations required of Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; (ii) provide such other information and communications to
Governmental Entities as such Governmental Entities may reasonably request;
and (iii) cooperate with Seller in Sellers obtaining, as soon as practicable,
all material Governmental Authorizations required of Seller to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. 



5.3 _Certain Employee Matters_.



(a) Purchaser covenants and agrees that it shall make offers of employment on
an "at will" basis (in substantially equivalent positions) to all of the
persons who are employees of (i) Seller with respect to the operation of the
Hospitals (other than the TRH Businesses) or (ii) any affiliate of Seller
which employs individuals at any of the Hospitals (other than the TRH
Businesses), (whether such employees are full time employees or part-time
employees) (the "Hospitals Employees") provided, however, that Purchaser
shall not be required to make offers of employment to (i) Hospitals
Employees that are on short-term or long-term disability, or on leave of
absence pursuant to Sellers policies, the Family and Medical Leave Act of
1993 or other similar local law, as of the Effective Time or (ii) the CEO,
the CFO or the COO of any Hospital. Purchaser agrees, however, that if any
Hospitals Employees, with respect to whom Purchaser was not required to, and
did not, extend an offer of employment pursuant to subsection (i) of the
immediately preceding sentence, seek employment with Purchaser following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall consider employing such persons in good faith in
accordance with Purchasers hiring policies then in effect. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges that Seller has the right, but is not
required, to retain any management-level Hospital Employee who does not accept
Purchasers employment offer made under this Section 5.3(a), which
individuals will remain employed by Seller or its applicable affiliate as of
the Effective Time (the "Retained Management Employees"). Any of the
Hospitals Employees who accept an offer of employment with Purchaser as of
or after the Effective Time shall be referred to in this Agreement as the
"Hired Employees". Purchaser covenants and agrees that it shall cause the
employees of TRH on the Closing Date, other than the CEO, the CFO or the COO
of the Three Rivers Hospitals (the "TRH Employees") to remain employed by TRH
as of the Effective Time. Subject to the terms of Section 1.11(d), Purchaser
covenants and agrees that it and TRH shall continue to employ in comparable
positions the Hired Employees and the TRH Employees for a period of no less
than ninety (90) calendar days following the Closing Date, unless Purchaser or
TRH sooner terminates the employment of any Hired Employee or TRH Employee
for cause or as a result of attrition, flexible staffing for seasonal
adjustments, downsizing in connection with decreases in patient census, or in
the event any Hired Employee or TRH Employee voluntarily resigns or retires.
Purchaser shall (and shall cause TRH to) ensure that the terms and conditions
of employment (including initial position, cash compensation, shifts,
benefits, including without limitation health, dental, disability, life
insurance and retirement plans) of each of the Hired Employees and TRH
Employees on and after the Effective Time are substantially equivalent to the
benefits provided to Purchasers employees at similar hospital facilities in
comparable positions or performing comparable functions as of the Effective
Date.



(b) Purchaser shall give all Hired Employees (and shall cause TRH to give the
TRH Employees) full credit for accumulated sick pay and extended sick pay as
reflected by the Sick Pay Amount as of the Closing Date, and other paid time
off pay to the extent included in Net Working Capital, either by (i)
crediting such employees the time off reflected in the employment records of
Seller, TRH and/or any of its affiliates immediately prior to the Effective
Time or (ii) by making full payments to such employees of the amounts which
such employees would have received had they taken such paid time off;
provided, however, this Section 5.3(b)(ii) shall not be applicable to the Sick
Pay Amount as of the Closing Date.



(c) On and after the Effective Time, Hired Employees and TRH Employees shall
be eligible for a medical and hospital plan sponsored by Purchaser. Hired
Employees and TRH Employees shall be given credit for periods of employment
with Seller, TRH and Sellers affiliates, as applicable, prior to
the Effective Time for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and
amount of benefits (including without limitation vesting of benefits), and
preexisting condition limitations will be waived with respect to Hired
Employees, TRH Employees and their covered dependents unless such preexisting
condition limitations were applicable prior to the Effective Time. In
addition, if prior to the Effective Time a Hired Employee, TRH Employee or his
covered dependents paid any amounts towards a deductible or out-of-pocket
maximum in Sellers, TRHs or its affiliates medical and health plans
current fiscal year, such amounts shall be applied toward satisfaction of the
deductible or out-of-pocket maximum in the current fiscal year of Purchasers
medical and health plan that covers Hired Employees and TRH Employees on and
after the Effective Time. (d) Within thirty (30) days after (i) the Hospitals Employees (other than
the Retained Management Employees) cease to be employees of Seller and
Sellers affiliates (as described in Section 4.9) and (ii) the TRH Employees
are no longer employed by an affiliate of THC, such persons will be entitled
to a distribution of their accounts under the Tenet Healthcare Corporation
401(k) Retirement Savings Plan. Any such Person whose account remains with the
Tenet Healthcare Corporation 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan will be subject to
the distribution provisions of such plan. Purchaser shall provide Seller (x)
with periodic reports, at least quarterly, to identify termination dates for
the Hired Employees and TRH Employees and (y) upon Sellers reasonable
request, prompt verification of the termination dates for Hired Employees and
TRH Employees.



(e) Seller shall be responsible to provide continuation coverage pursuant to
the requirements of Code section 4980B and Part 6 of Title I of ERISA ("COBRA
Coverage") with respect to (i) the Hospitals Employees (and their
dependents) whose qualifying event occurred prior to the date on which such
Hospitals Employees become Hired Employees and (ii) the TRH Employees (and
their dependents) whose qualifying event occurred prior to the Effective Time.
Purchaser shall be responsible to provide COBRA Coverage with respect to each
of the (x) Hired Employees (and their dependents) whose qualifying event
occurs on or after the date on which such Hospitals Employees become Hired
Employees and (y) TRH Employees (and their dependents) whose qualifying event
occurs on or after the Effective Time.



(f) After the Closing Date, Purchasers human resources department will give
reasonable assistance to Sellers and its affiliates human resources
department with respect to Sellers and Sellers affiliates post-Closing
administration of Sellers, TRHs and Sellers affiliates pre-Closing
employee pension benefit plans and employee health or welfare benefit plans
for the Hospitals Employees (other than the Retained Management Employees)
and the TRH Employees. Within five (5) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall provide to Seller a list of all the Hospitals Employees who were
offered employment by Purchaser but refused such employment.



5.4 _Use of Business Names_. Purchaser covenants that it and its affiliates
shall not use in their respective trades or businesses the names "Tenet
Healthcare Corporation", "Tenet", "Tenet HealthSystem", "OrNda HealthCorp",
and any other names or symbols not used exclusively at any of the Hospitals
prior to the Effective Time, any abbreviations or variations thereof or
service marks, symbols or logos related thereto, nor any promotional material,
stationery, supplies or other items of inventory bearing either such names,
symbols or abbreviations or variations thereof.



5.5 _Excluded Assets_. As soon as practicable after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller or Sellers designee any Excluded
Assets found at any of the Hospitals on and after the Effective Time, without
imposing any charge on Seller for Purchasers storage or holding of same on
and after the Effective Time.



5.6 _Confidentiality_. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its employees,
representatives and agents to, hold in strict confidence, unless compelled to
disclose by judicial or administrative process or, in the opinion of
Purchasers counsel, by other requirements of law, all Confidential
Information (as hereinafter defined), and Purchaser shall not disclose the
Confidential Information to any person, except as otherwise may be reasonably necessary to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
business or diligence review by or on behalf of Purchaser. Purchasers
obligations set forth in the immediately preceding sentence shall apply (a)
between the Effective Date and the Effective Time with respect
to Confidential Information which is among the Assets and Confidential
Information of TRH and (b) after the Effective Time for all Confidential
Information which is not described in subsection (a) above. For the purposes
hereof, "Confidential Information" shall mean all information of any kind
concerning Seller, TRH or the business of the Hospitals, in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except information (i)
ascertainable or obtained from public or published information, (ii) received
from a third party not known by Purchaser to be under an obligation to Seller,
TRH or any affiliate of Seller to keep such information confidential, (iii)
which is or becomes known to the public (other than through a breach of this
Agreement), or (iv) which was in Purchasers possession prior to disclosure
thereof to Purchaser in connection herewith. The rights of Seller under this
Section 5.6 shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the rights of
Seller and Sellers affiliates under that certain Confidentiality Agreement
between THC and Purchaser, dated March 19, 2003 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), which Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the Closing. 



5.7 _Enforceability_. Purchaser hereby acknowledges that the restrictions
contained in Section 5.6 above are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of Seller. The parties also hereby acknowledge and agree
that any breach of Section 5.6 would result in irreparable injury to Seller
and that any remedy at law for any breach of Section 5.6 would be inadequate.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
parties therefore agree, and Purchaser hereby specifically consents that,
without necessity of proof of actual damage, Seller may be granted temporary
or permanent injunctive relief, that Seller shall be entitled to an equitable
accounting of all earnings, profits and other benefits arising from such
breach, and that Seller shall be entitled to recover its reasonable fees and
expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by Seller in enforcing the
restrictions contained in Section 5.6.



5.8 _Hart-Scott-Rodino Act Filings_. Purchaser shall (a) take promptly all
actions necessary to make the filings required of Purchaser or its affiliates
under the HSR Act, (b) comply at the earliest practicable date with any
request for additional information received by Purchaser or its affiliates
from the FTC or the DOJ pursuant to the HSR Act, and (c) cooperate with Seller
in connection with Sellers or Sellers affiliates filings under the HSR Act
and in connection with resolving any investigation or other regulatory inquiry
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement commenced by
either the FTC or the DOJ. All filing fees imposed in connection with
Purchasers filings under the HSR Act shall be borne by the parties in
accordance with Section 12.12.



5.9 _Waiver of Bulk Sales Law Compliance_. Purchaser hereby waives compliance
by Seller with the requirements, if any, of Article 6 of the Uniform
Commercial Code as in force in any state in which the Assets are located and
all other similar laws applicable to bulk sales and transfers.



5.10 _Multi-Hospital Contracts_. After the Effective Date, Purchaser shall
(and shall cause TRH to) use its reasonable commercial good faith efforts to
obtain, prior to the Closing    Date, such novations, amendments, new contracts or other documentation as
provides comfort reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that it will obtain
the benefits of the Multi-Hospital Contracts which are not among the Material
Payor Contracts at and after the Effective Time; provided, however, that
Purchasers obtaining of such novations, amendments, new contracts or other
documentation shall not be a condition precedent to either partys obligation
to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. With respect to any
Multi-Hospital Contract which is a third party payor contract and which is not
among the Material Payor Contracts, any new contract executed shall be a
direct contract between Purchaser (or TRH, as applicable) and the applicable
third party payor which governs Purchasers (or TRHs) provision of services
to the applicable third party payors members and/or beneficiaries on and
after the Effective Time.



5.11 _Tax-Deferred Exchange_. Seller may effect one or more tax-deferred
exchanges under Internal Revenue Code §1031 in respect of the Real Property
(or a portion thereof). Purchaser agrees to accommodate Seller in effecting
any such tax-deferred exchange. Seller shall have the right to elect such tax-
deferred exchange at any time before the Closing Date. Seller and Purchaser
agree, however, that consummation of the purchase and sale of the
Real Property under this Agreement is not conditioned on such exchange. If
Seller elects to make a tax-deferred exchange, Purchaser agrees to timely
execute such additional escrow instructions, deeds, documents, agreements, or
instruments to effect such exchange, and Purchaser acknowledges that time is
of the essence in respect of Purchasers cooperation hereunder, provided that
Purchaser shall incur no additional costs, expenses, or liabilities in this
transaction as a result of or in connection with such exchange. If Seller
does elect to effect one or more tax-deferred exchanges hereunder, it may in
furtherance thereof substitute an intermediary (the "Intermediary") to act in
place of Seller as the seller of one or more of such parcels. The
Intermediary would be designated in writing by Seller. Upon identification of
Intermediary, Intermediary shall be substituted for Seller as the seller of
the real property. Seller shall unconditionally guarantee the full and timely
performance by Intermediary of each and every one of the representations,
warranties, indemnities, obligations and undertakings of Intermediary. As
guarantor, Seller shall be treated as a primary obligor with respect to
those representations, warranties, indemnities, obligations and undertakings,
and, in the event of breach, Purchaser may proceed directly against Seller on
this guarantee without the need to join Intermediary as a party to any action
against Seller. Seller unconditionally waives any defense that it might have
as guarantor that it would not have if it had made or undertaken these
representations, warranties, indemnities, obligations and undertakings
directly.



5.12 _Indigent and Low Income Care_. From and after the Closing Date, with
respect to the operation of the Hospitals, Purchaser shall adhere to and
comply with its then existing policies (as in effect with respect to
Purchasers other hospitals) regarding indigent and charity care, as such
policies may be amended or supplemented from time to time.



5.13 _Medical Staff_. To ensure continuity of care in the community,
Purchaser agrees that the Hospitals medical staff members in good standing as
of the Effective Time shall maintain medical staff privileges at such
Hospitals as of the Effective Time. On and after the Effective Time, the
medical staff will be subject to each Hospitals Medical Staff Bylaws then in
effect, to the extent consistent with applicable law. 5.14 _Local Governing Board_.



(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Purchaser
shall form a local governing board at each of the Hospitals (other than the
Three Rivers Hospitals) in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.14, and
Purchaser shall cause TRH to continue the existence of TRHs current local
governing board(s) for the Three Rivers Hospitals in accordance with the
terms of this Section 5.14; provided, however, the terms of this Section 5.14
as applicable to TRH shall be subject to Section 14.4 of the Stock Purchase
Agreement (for so long as the terms of such Section 14.4 remain in effect).
Such local governing board shall be an advisory committee of the board of
directors of Purchaser (and TRH, as applicable) comprised of medical staff
members, community leaders and each Hospitals Chief Executive Officer. The
local governing board shall be subject to the authority of Purchasers (and
TRHs, as applicable) board of directors and the terms of Purchasers (and
TRHs, as applicable) Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and other
organizational documents. The individuals on the local governing board will
be appointed solely by Purchaser and should (i) represent the Hospital in the
community and represent the views of the community to the local governing
board in its deliberations, (ii) participate in Purchasers and TRHs
community outreach programs and (iii) consult with respect to the Hospitals
charity care policies and practices.



(b) The local governing board of each Hospital shall have responsibilities
that are consistent with similar local governing boards at other hospitals,
or in other markets, respectively, which are owned directly or indirectly by
affiliates of Purchaser. The local governing boards responsibilities shall
include:



(i) participation in and consultation on the selection of the Hospitals
Chief Executive Officer and the Hospitals Medical Director;



(ii) input regarding medical needs assessments prior to the termination or
substantial change to any material service, program or type or level of care
offered at the Hospital at the time of Closing;



(iii) providing for the organization of the physicians and other practitioners
granted clinical privileges at the Hospital into a medical staff under medical
staff bylaws approved by the local governing board; 



(iv) accepting and reviewing information regarding medical staff appointments
and privileges, subject to the bylaws and the rules and regulations of the
medical staff;



(v) ensuring, through the medical staff, that appropriate professional care is
provided to Hospital patients (this includes reviewing and, if necessary,
acting upon reports of medical care evaluation, utilization management and
other matters relating to the quality of care rendered in the Hospital); and



(vi) providing consultation with respect to the reasonable and necessary steps
to be taken by the medical staff and Hospital management for meeting JCAHO
accreditation. 5.15 _Subsequent Sale_. If Purchaser or TRH decides to sell, merge, or
otherwise transfer or consolidate any of the Hospitals during a period when
Purchaser or TRH is performing any operating covenants pursuant to Sections
5.12, 5.13 or 5.14, Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to seek to cause
such subsequent owner of the applicable Hospital to fulfill Purchasers
obligations under each of Sections 5.12, 5.13 or 5.14, and, with respect to
TRH, Purchaser shall require the subsequent owner of Three Rivers Hospital
(with Purchaser remaining bound therefor) to fulfill Purchasers obligations
under Section 5.14, as applicable, so long as Section 14.4 of the Stock
Purchase Agreement remains in effect.

ARTICLE 8



TERMINATION



8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
Closing:



(a) by the mutual written consent of the parties;



(b) by Seller if a material breach of this Agreement has been committed by
Purchaser and such breach has not been (i) waived in writing by Seller or (ii)
cured by Purchaser to the reasonable satisfaction of Seller within fifteen
(15) business days after service by Seller upon Purchaser of a written
notice which describes the nature of such breach;



(c) by Purchaser if a material breach of this Agreement has been committed by
Seller and such breach has not been (i) waived in writing by Purchaser or (ii)
cured by Seller to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser within fifteen
(15) business days after service by Purchaser upon Seller of a written notice
which describes the nature of such breach;



(d) by Purchaser, but solely with respect to the Hospitals in a single state,
upon the delivery of a Casualty Termination Notice to Seller in accordance
with Section 1.14;



(e) by Purchaser, if, since June 30, 2003, there has occurred any event,
change or development that has had a "material adverse effect" on the assets,
financial condition, or operations of the Hospitals taken as a whole;
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the following will be presumed not to give rise to a "material
adverse effect": (a) changes or proposed changes to any law, reimbursement
rates or policies of governmental agencies or bodies that are generally
applicable to hospitals or healthcare facilities, or (b) requirements,
reimbursement rates, policies or procedures of third party payors or
accreditation commissions or organizations that are generally applicable to
hospitals or healthcare facilities (the definition of the term, "material
adverse effect", as set forth in this Section 8.1(e), shall be used solely for
determining Purchasers termination right under this Section 8.1(e) and not
for interpreting the phrase "material adverse effect" for any other usage in
this Agreement); or



(f) by either Purchaser or Seller if no Closing has occurred (other than
through the failure of any party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement) on or before December
31, 2003 (the "Termination Date"); provided, that the Termination Date shall
be extended to February 29, 2004 (the "Extended Termination Date") if, as of
the Termination Date, (i) any condition precedent contained in Section 6.5 or
7.5 has not been satisfied or, if not satisfied, waived by the applicable
party or (ii)    the Closing has not occurred and the parties are awaiting approval therefor
from a state or federal governmental agency or governmental body.



8.2 _Termination Consequences_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, (a) all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement
shall terminate, except that the obligations in Sections 5.6, 12.3, 12.8, and
12.12 shall survive, (b) each party shall pay the costs and expenses incurred
by it in connection with this Agreement, except as provided in Section 12.12,
and (c) nothing shall prevent any party hereto from pursuing any of its legal
rights or remedies that may be granted to any such party by law against any
other party to this Agreement, except that no party shall be entitled to
obtain Consequential Damages.



ARTICLE 9



POST-CLOSING MATTERS



9.1 _Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities_. Subject to Section 11.2
hereof, any asset (including Accounts Receivable) or any liability, all other
remittances and all mail and other communications that is an Excluded Asset or
an Excluded Liability (a) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (b) as
otherwise determined by the parties mutual written agreement or (c) absent
such agreement, as determined by adjudication by a court or similar tribunal,
and which comes into the possession, custody or control of Purchaser or TRH
(or their respective successors-in-interest, assigns or affiliates) shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable but in no event longer than fifteen (15)
business days, be transferred, assigned or conveyed by Purchaser (and its
respective successors-in-interest, assigns and affiliates) to Seller at
Sellers cost. Until such transfer, assignment and conveyance, Purchaser (and
its respective successors-in-interest, assigns and affiliates) shall not have
any right, title or interest in or obligation or responsibility with respect
to such asset or liability except that Purchaser shall (and shall cause TRH
to) hold such asset in trust for the benefit of Seller. Purchaser (and its
respective successors-in-interest, assigns and affiliates) shall have neither
the right to offset amounts payable to Seller under this Section 9.1 against,
nor the right to contest its obligation to transfer, assign and convey to
Seller because of, outstanding claims, liabilities or obligations asserted by
Purchaser against Seller including but not limited to pursuant to the post-
Closing Cash Purchase Price adjustment of Section 1.4 and the indemnification
provisions of Section 10.2. If Purchaser does not remit the Excluded Assets
to Seller in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 9.1, such
Excluded Assets shall bear interest at the Prime Rate in effect on the
calendar day upon which such payment was required to be made to Seller
(the "Excluded Asset Due Date") plus five percent (5%) (or the maximum rate
allowed by law, whichever is less), such interest accruing on each calendar
day after the Excluded Asset Due Date until payment of the Excluded Assets and
all interest thereon is made to Seller. With respect to payment received by
Purchaser or TRH on account of Transition Services, this Section 9.1 shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 11.3. The terms of this Article 9 shall
not be subject to the time limitations contained in Section 10.1 of this
Agreement.



9.2  _Preservation and Access to Records After the Closing_.



(a) From the Closing Date until seven (7) years after the Closing Date or such
longer period as required by law (the "Document Retention Period"), Purchaser
shall (and shall    cause TRH to) keep and preserve in the ordinary course of business all
medical records, patient records, medical staff records and other books and
records which are among the Assets as of the Effective Time or which are in
the possession of TRH as of the Effective Time, but excluding any records
which are among the Excluded Assets. Purchaser will (and will cause TRH to)
afford to the representatives of Seller, including its counsel and
accountants, full and complete access to, and copies (including, without
limitation, color laser copies) of, such records with respect to time periods
prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, access to records
of patients treated at the Hospitals prior to the Effective Time) on
reasonable prior notice during normal business hours after the Effective Time,
to the extent reasonably needed by Seller or Sellers affiliates for
business purposes. Purchaser acknowledges that, as a result of entering into
this Agreement and operating the Hospitals, it will gain access to patient
records and other information which are subject to rules and regulations
concerning confidentiality. Purchaser shall (and shall cause TRH to) abide by
any such rules and regulations relating to the confidential information it
acquires. Purchaser shall (and shall cause TRH to) maintain the patient and
medical staff records at the Hospitals in accordance with applicable law and
the requirements of relevant insurance carriers. After the expiration of the
Document Retention Period, if Purchaser or TRH intends to destroy or otherwise
dispose of any of the documents described in this Section 9.2(a), Purchaser
shall provide written notice to Seller of Purchasers or TRHs intention no
later than forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the date of such intended
destruction or disposal. Seller shall have the right, at its sole cost, to
take possession of such documents during such forty-five (45) calendar day
period. If Seller does not take possession of such documents during such
forty-five (45) calendar day period, Purchaser or TRH shall be free to destroy
or otherwise dispose of such documentation upon the expiration of such forty-
five (45) calendar day period.



(b) Purchaser shall (and shall cause TRH to) give reasonable cooperation to
Seller, Sellers affiliates and their insurance carriers in respect of the
defense of claims by third parties against Seller or any affiliate of Seller,
in respect of events occurring prior to the Effective Time with respect to the
operation of the Hospitals. Such cooperation shall include,
without limitation, making the Hired Employees and the TRH Employees
reasonably available for interviews, depositions, hearings and trials. Such
cooperation shall also include making all of Purchasers and TRHs employees
available to assist in the securing and giving of evidence and in obtaining
the presence and cooperation of witnesses (all of which shall be done without
payment of any fees or expenses to Purchaser or to such employees). In
addition, Seller and Sellers affiliates shall be entitled to remove from the
Hospitals originals of any such records, but only for purposes of pending
litigation involving the persons to whom such records refer, as certified in
writing prior to removal by counsel retained by Seller or any of Sellers
affiliates in connection with such litigation. Any records so removed from the
Hospitals shall be promptly returned to Purchaser or TRH following Sellers or
its applicable affiliates use of such records.



(c) In connection with (i) the transition of the Hospitals pursuant to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) Sellers rights to the
Excluded Assets, (iii) Sellers obligations under the Excluded Liabilities and
(iv) Sellers preparation of the Final Balance Sheet pursuant to Section 1.4,
Purchaser shall (and shall cause TRH to) after the Effective Time give Seller,
Sellers affiliates and their respective representatives access during normal
business hours to Purchasers books, accounts and records and all other
relevant documents and information with respect to the assets, liabilities and
business of the Hospitals as representatives of Seller and Sellers affiliates
may from time to time reasonably request, all in    such manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the operations of the
Hospitals. Seller acknowledges that it shall coordinate its activities
contemplated by this Section 9.2(c) through the Chief Executive Officer of
each applicable Hospital, or his designee.



(d) Purchaser and its representatives shall be given access by Seller during
normal business hours to the extent reasonably needed by Purchaser for
business purposes to all documents, records, correspondence, work papers and
other documents retained by Seller pertaining to any of the Assets or with
respect to the operation of the Hospitals prior to the Effective Time
(including the Receivables Records), all in such manner as to not interfere
unreasonably with Sellers business. Such documents and other materials shall
be, at Sellers option, either (i) copied by Seller for Purchaser at
Purchasers expense, or (ii) removed by Purchaser from the premises, copied
by Purchaser and promptly returned to Seller.



(e) Purchaser shall comply with, and be solely responsible for, all
obligations under the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable
Health Information (45 CFR Parts 160 and 164) promulgated pursuant to the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 with respect to
the operation of the Hospitals on and after the Effective Time.



9.3 _Provision of Benefits of Certain Managed Care Contracts_. On and after
the Effective Date, Purchaser shall use its best efforts to obtain
assignments, novations, amendments, new contracts, or such other agreements or
documentation (collectively, the "Assignments and Novations") from the third
parties to certain managed care contracts relating to the Hospitals
(including but not limited to certain Multi-Hospital Contracts) that are
identified on Schedule 9.3 (collectively, the "Material Payor Contracts"),
which Assignments and Novations would provide Purchaser reasonably
satisfactory comfort that Purchaser would obtain the benefits associated with
such Material Payor Contracts following the Closing. Seller shall cooperate
with Purchasers efforts. Purchaser shall provide Seller with periodic
updates of Purchasers progress. If, as of the Closing Date, Purchaser is
unable to obtain a reasonably satisfactory Assignment and Novation with
respect to any Material Payor Contract, Seller and Purchaser shall,
using their good faith efforts, fashion a mutually agreeable remedy pursuant
to which Purchaser will receive the benefit of such identified Material Payor
Contract during the period from the Closing Date until the earlier of (a) the
date an Assignment and Novation reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser is
obtained or (b) the date that such Material Payor Contract would first be
terminable by the third party thereto without cause. Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Purchasers obtaining
any of the Assignments and Novations with respect to the Material Payor
Contracts shall not be a condition precedent to either partys obligation to
close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. 



9.4 _Americans with Disabilities Act_. The parties respective
responsibilities and obligations with respect to the nationwide settlement
agreement of Seller and/or Sellers affiliates regarding the Americans with
Disabilities Act shall be specified in an agreement executed by the parties
at Closing, the form of which will be attached hereto as Exhibit 9.4, and
which will be mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Seller. ARTICLE 10



SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION



 

10.1 _Survival_. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement to the
contrary, all representations, warranties, covenants, agreements
and indemnifications of Purchaser and Seller, respectively, contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto shall be deemed to be
material and to have been relied upon by Purchaser and Seller, respectively,
and shall continue to be fully effective and enforceable following the
Closing Date for two years and shall thereafter be of no further force and
effect, except that (a) the representation contained in Section 2.6 and the
indemnifications contained in Sections 10.2.1(h), 10.2.1(i), 10.3.1(c),

applicable statute of limitations, and (b) the covenant contained in Section
5.14 and the indemnifications contained in Sections 10.2.1(c), 10.2.1(d),
10.2.1(e) and 10.3.1(d) shall continue to be fully effective and enforceable
following the Closing Date without any time limitation; provided, however,
that if there is an outstanding notice of a claim at the end of such two year
period or longer period described above in compliance with the terms of
Section 10.4, such applicable period shall not end in respect of such claim
until such claim is resolved. 



10.2 _Indemnification of Purchaser by Seller_. 



10.2.1 _Indemnification_. Each Seller, for itself and its successors, shall
jointly and severally keep and save Purchaser, and its directors, officers,
employees, agents and other representatives, forever harmless from and shall
indemnify and defend Purchaser against any and all obligations, judgments,
liabilities, interest, penalties, violations, actions, suits, proceedings,
fees, fines, claims, losses, costs, demands, damages, liens, encumbrances, and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and litigation costs)
(collectively, "Damages"), to the extent connected with or arising or
resulting from (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller
under this Agreement, (b) any breach or default by Seller of any covenant or
agreement of Seller under this Agreement, (c) the Excluded Liabilities, (d)
the Excluded Assets, (e) all federal, state and local income taxes relating to
Seller ("Seller Tax Claims"), (f) any professional liability claim arising out
of the business operations of the Hospitals prior to the Effective Time, (g)
any act, conduct or omission of Seller or TRH that has accrued, arisen,
occurred or come into existence at any time prior to the Effective Time, (h)
any of those certain pending governmental investigations which are described
on Schedule 10.2.1, (i) Purchasers participation in any tax-deferred exchange
pursuant to Section 5.11 and (j) Sellers failure to obtain at Closing any UCC
termination statements for any and all financing statements (which do not
correspond to a Permitted Exception or an agreement which is among the Assumed
Obligations) filed with respect to the Assets. Sellers obligations under this
Section 10.2.1 shall remain subject to, and shall be limited by, the
provisions contained in Section 1.13. No provision in this Agreement shall
prevent Seller from pursuing any of its legal rights or remedies that may be
granted to Seller by law against any person or legal entity other
than Purchaser. 10.2.2 _Indemnification Limitations_. (a) Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, Seller shall be under no liability
to indemnify Purchaser under Section 10.2.1 and no claim under Section 10.2.1
of this Agreement shall:



     | (i) | be made unless notice thereof shall have been given by or on
behalf of Purchaser to Seller in the manner provided in Section 10.4, unless
failure to provide such notice in a timely manner does not materially impair
Sellers ability to defend its rights, mitigate damages, seek indemnification
from a third party or otherwise protect its interests; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | be made to the extent that any loss may be recovered under
a policy of insurance in force on the date of loss; provided, however, that
this Section 10.2.2(a)(ii) shall not apply to the extent that coverage under
the applicable policy of insurance is denied by the applicable insurance
carrier; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | be made to the extent that such claim relates to a
liability arising out of or relating to any act, omission, event or occurrence
connected with: 
---|---|--- 


     | (A) | the use, ownership or operation of any of the Hospitals, or 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | the use, ownership or operation of any of the Assets or the
assets comprising any of the TRH Businesses, 
---|---|--- 



on and after the Effective Time (without regard to whether such use, ownership
or operation is consistent with Sellers or TRHs policies, procedures and/or
practices prior to the Effective Time); other than as specifically included in
the Excluded Liabilities;



     | (iv) | be made if and to the extent that proper provision or
reserve was made for the matter giving rise to the claim in Net Working
Capital; 
---|---|--- 


     | (v) | be made to the extent such claim relates to an obligation or
liability for which Purchaser has agreed to indemnify Seller pursuant to
Section 10.3; 
---|---|--- 


     | (vi) | be made to the extent that such claim would not have arisen
but for a voluntary act, omission or transaction carried out by Purchaser, TRH
or their affiliates after the Effective Date; 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | be made to the extent such claim seeks Damages which are
consequential in nature (as opposed to direct), including, without limitation,
loss of future revenue or income or loss of business reputation or
opportunity (collectively, "Consequential Damages"); provided, however, the
limitation contained in this Section 10.2.2(a)(vii) shall not apply to the
extent of any payments which Purchaser is required to make to a third party
which are in the nature of Consequential Damages; and 
---|---|--- that (A) the actual liability of Seller in respect of any single claim under
Section 10.2.1(a) exceeds Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) (a "Relevant Claim")
and (B) the total actual liability of Seller in respect of all Relevant Claims
in the aggregate exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "Aggregate
Amount"), in which event Purchaser shall be entitled to seek indemnification
under Section 10.2.1(a) for all Relevant Claims in the full amount of Damages
provided, however, that the Aggregate Amount shall be inapplicable to any
claim by Purchaser for indemnification as a result of a breach by Seller of
the provisions of Section 2.6(a). 
---|---|--- 



(b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the maximum aggregate liability of Seller to Purchaser under this Agreement
shall not exceed the Cash Purchase Price.



(c) If Purchaser is entitled to recover any sum (whether by payment,
discount, credit or otherwise) from any third party in respect of any matter
for which a claim of indemnity could be made against Seller hereunder,
Purchaser shall use its reasonable endeavors to recover such sum from such
third party and any sum recovered will reduce the amount of the claim. If
Seller pays to Purchaser an amount in respect of a claim, and Purchaser
subsequently recovers from a third party a sum which is referable to that
claim, Purchaser shall forthwith repay such amount to Seller less all
reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred by Purchaser in obtaining
payment in respect of that claim and in recovering that sum from the third
party.



10.3 _Indemnification of Seller by Purchaser_.



10.3.1 _Indemnification_. Purchaser shall keep and save Seller, and Sellers
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and other representatives,
forever harmless from and shall indemnify and defend Seller and Sellers
affiliates against any and all Damages, to the extent connected with or
arising or resulting from (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of
Purchaser under this Agreement, (b) any breach or default by Purchaser under
any covenant or agreement of Purchaser under this Agreement, (c) cost reports
(and all claims with respect thereto) relating to Purchaser or TRH with
respect to Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare or Blue Cross programs or any other
third-party payor for all periods beginning on and after the Effective Time,
(d) the Assumed Obligations, (e) any professional liability claim arising out
of the business operations of the Hospitals on and after the Effective Time,
(f) any other obligation or liability specifically assumed by Purchaser in
this Agreement, (g) liabilities to the Hired Employees arising out of actions
of Purchaser based wholly or in part upon the contents of the personnel
records of such employees, (h) involuntary termination of the Hired Employees
or the TRH Employees on and after the Effective Time, which termination would
constitute a "mass layoff" or a "plant closing" within the meaning of WARN,
(i) any act, conduct or omission of Purchaser that has accrued, arisen,
occurred or come into existence at any time, (j) any act, conduct or omission
of TRH that has accrued, arisen, occurred or come into existence at any time
on or after the Effective Time, and (k) any securities litigation involving
(i) Purchaser and/or (ii) any financing obtained by Purchaser which is
utilized to fund, in whole or in part, the Cash Purchase Price, other than to
the extent arising out of any willful misconduct of Seller or its employees, or intentionally false or intentionally misleading statements of
Seller or its employees. No provision in this Agreement shall prevent
Purchaser from pursuing any of its legal rights or remedies that may be
granted to Purchaser by law against any person or legal entity other than
Seller or any affiliate of Seller.



10.3.2 _Indemnification Limitations_. (a) Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, Purchaser shall be under no
liability to indemnify Seller under 10.3.1 and no claim under Section 10.3.1
of this Agreement shall:



     | (i) | be made unless notice thereof shall have been given by or on
behalf of Seller to Purchaser in the manner provided in Section 10.4, unless
failure to provide such notice in a timely manner does not materially impair
Purchasers ability to defend its rights, mitigate damages, seek
indemnification from a third party or otherwise protect its interests; 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | be made to the extent that any loss may be recovered under
a policy of insurance in force on the date of loss; provided, however, that
this Section 10.3.2(a)(ii) shall not apply to the extent that coverage under
the applicable policy of insurance is denied by the applicable insurance
carrier; 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | be made to the extent that such claim relates to a
liability of Seller or TRH arising out of or relating to any act, omission,
event or occurrence connected with:  
---|---|--- 



     | (A) | the use, ownership or operation of any of the Hospitals, or 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | the use, operation or ownership of any of the Assets or the
assets comprising the TRH Businesses, 
---|---|--- 



prior to the Effective Time, other than as specifically included in the
Assumed Obligations;



     | (iv) | be made to the extent such claim relates to an obligation
or liability for which Seller has agreed to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to
Section 10.2; 
---|---|--- 


     | (v) | be made to the extent such claim seeks Consequential
Damages; provided, however, the limitation contained in this Section
10.3.2(a)(v) shall not apply to the extent of any payments which Seller or
any affiliate of Seller is required to make to a third party which are in the
nature of Consequential Damages; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | accrue to Seller unless and only to the extent that (A) the
actual liability of Purchaser in respect of any single claim under Section
10.3.1(a) exceeds Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) (a "Seller Relevant Claim")
and (B) the total actual liability of Purchaser in 
---|---|--- exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), in which event Seller shall be
entitled to seek indemnification under Section 10.3.1(a) for all Seller
Relevant Claims in the full amount of Damages. 
---|---|--- 



(b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the maximum aggregate liability of Purchaser to Seller under this Agreement,
subsequent to Purchaser paying the Cash Purchase Price at Closing (as adjusted
pursuant to Section 1.4), shall not exceed an additional amount equal to the
Cash Purchase Price.



(c) If Seller is entitled to recover any sum (whether by payment, discount,
credit or otherwise) from any third party in respect of any matter for which a
claim of indemnity could be made against Purchaser hereunder, Seller shall use
its reasonable endeavors to recover such sum from such third party and any
sum recovered will reduce the amount of the claim. If Purchaser pays to Seller
an amount in respect of a claim, and Seller subsequently recovers from a third
party a sum which is referable to that claim, Seller shall forthwith repay
such amount Purchaser less all reasonable costs, charges and expenses
incurred by Seller in obtaining payment in respect of that claim and in
recovering that sum from the third party.





10.4 _Method of Asserting Claims_. All claims for indemnification by any
person entitled to indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") under this
Article 10 will be asserted and resolved as follows:



(a) In the event any claim or demand, for which a party hereto (an
"Indemnifying Party") would be liable for the Damages to an Indemnified
Party, is asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified
Party by a person other than Seller, Purchaser or their affiliates (a "Third
Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a notice of its claim (a
"Claim Notice") to the Indemnifying Party within thirty (30) calendar days
after the Indemnified Party receives written notice of such Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that notice shall be provided to the Indemnifying Party
within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of a complaint, petition or
institution of other formal legal action by the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party fails to provide the Claim Notice within such
applicable time period after the Indemnified Party receives written notice of
such Third Party Claim and thereby materially impairs the Indemnifying Partys
ability to protect its interests, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated
to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.
The Indemnifying Party will notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
calendar days after receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") whether
the Indemnifying Party desires, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party
Claim.



(i) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party within the Notice
Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Indemnified Party
with respect to the Third Party Claim pursuant to this Section 10.4(a), then
the Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend, at its sole cost and
expense, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings,
which proceedings will be prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final
conclusion or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnifying Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party may, at its sole
cost and expense, file during the Notice Period any motion, answer or other
pleadings that the Indemnified Party may deem necessary or appropriate to
protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and which is not
prejudicial, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnifying Party, to the
Indemnifying Party. Except as provided in Section 10.4(a)(ii) hereof, if an
Indemnified Party takes any such action that is prejudicial and causes a final
adjudication that is adverse to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying
Party will be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to the
portion of such Third Party Claim prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys
action. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees,
at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim that
the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, or, if appropriate and related to
the Third Party Claim in question, in making any counterclaim against the
person asserting the Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any
person (other than the Indemnified Party or any of its affiliates). The
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Section 10.4(a)(i), and except as specifically provided in
this Section 10.4(a)(i), the Indemnified Party will bear its own costs
and expenses with respect to such participation.



(ii) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within
the Notice Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 10.4(a), or if the Indemnifying
Party gives such notice but fails to prosecute diligently or settle the Third
Party Claim, or if the Indemnifying Party fails to give any notice whatsoever
within the Notice Period, then the Indemnified Party will have the right to
defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third
Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will be promptly
and reasonably prosecuted by the Indemnified Party to a final conclusion or
will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified
Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that if requested by the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party agrees, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the Indemnified Party and
its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Indemnified Party is
contesting, or, if appropriate and related to the Third Party Claim
in question, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting the
Third Party Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person (other than the
Indemnifying Party or any of its affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 10.4(a)(ii), if the Indemnifying Party has
notified the Indemnified Party with reasonable promptness that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim and if such dispute is resolved in favor of
the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party will not be required to bear
the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Partys defense pursuant to this
Section 10.4(a)(ii) or of the Indemnifying Partys participation therein
at the Indemnified Partys request, and the Indemnified Party will reimburse
the Indemnifying Party in full for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such litigation. Subject to the
above terms of this Section 10.4(a)(ii), the Indemnifying Party may
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 10.4(a)(ii), and the Indemnifying
Party will bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation. The Indemnified Party shall give sufficient prior notice to the
Indemnifying Party of the initiation of any discussions relating to the
settlement of a Third Party Claim to allow the Indemnifying Party
to participate therein. (b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that either (i) does not involve a Third Party
Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from the Indemnified
Party or (ii) is a Seller Tax Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver an
Indemnity Notice (as hereinafter defined) to the Indemnifying Party. (The
term "Indemnity Notice" shall mean written notification of a claim for
indemnity under Article 10 hereof (which claim does not involve a Third Party
Claim or is a Seller Tax Claim) by an Indemnified Party to an Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Section 10.4, specifying the nature of and specific
basis for such claim and the amount or the estimated amount of such claim.)
The failure by any Indemnified Party to give the Indemnity Notice shall not
impair such partys rights hereunder except to the extent that an Indemnifying
Party demonstrates that it has been prejudiced thereby.



(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) calendar days following its receipt of a Claim Notice or an
Indemnity Notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party hereunder, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party
will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder
and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the
Indemnified Party on demand, or on such later date (i) in the case of a Third
Party Claim, as the Indemnified Party suffers the Damages in respect of such
Third Party Claim, (ii) in the case of an Indemnity Notice in which the
amount of the claim is estimated, when the amount of such claim becomes
finally determined or (iii) in the case of a Seller Tax Claim, within fifteen
(15) calendar days following final determination of the item giving rise to
the claim for indemnity. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its
liability with respect to such claim, as provided above, the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party agree to proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute, and if not resolved through negotiations, such
dispute will be resolved by adjudication by a court or similar tribunal.



(d) The Indemnified Party agrees to give the Indemnifying Party reasonable
access to the books and records and employees of the Indemnified Party in
connection with the matters for which indemnification is sought hereunder, to
the extent the Indemnifying Party reasonably deems necessary in connection
with its rights and obligations hereunder.



(e) The Indemnified Party shall assist and cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party in the conduct of litigation, the making of settlements and the
enforcement of any right of contribution to which the Indemnified Party may be
entitled from any person or entity in connection with the subject matter of
any litigation subject to indemnification hereunder. In addition, the
Indemnified Party shall, upon request by the Indemnifying Party or counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party (without payment of any fees or expenses to
the Indemnified Party or an employee thereof), attend hearings and trials,
assist in the securing and giving of evidence, assist in obtaining the
presence or cooperation of witnesses, and make available its own personnel;
and shall do whatever else is necessary and appropriate in connection with
such litigation. The Indemnified Party shall not make any demand upon the
Indemnifying Party or counsel for the Indemnifying Party in connection with
any litigation subject to indemnification hereunder, except a general demand
for indemnification as provided hereunder. If the Indemnified Party shall
fail to perform such obligations as Indemnified Party hereunder or to
cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party in Indemnifying Partys defense of
any suit or proceeding, such cooperation to include, without limitation,
attendance at all depositions and the provision of all documents relevant to the defense of any claim, then, except
where such failure does not have an adverse effect on the Indemnifying
Partys defense of such claims, the Indemnifying Party shall be released from
all of its obligations under this Agreement with respect to that suit or
proceeding and any other claims which had been raised in such suit or
proceeding.



(f) Following indemnification as provided for hereunder, the Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party with respect
to all persons or entities relating to the matter for which indemnification
has been made; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall have no
subrogation rights to seek reimbursement through or from the Indemnified
Partys insurance policies, program, coverage, carriers or beneficiaries.



10.5 _Exclusive_. Other than claims for fraud or equitable relief
(which equitable relief claims are nevertheless subject to Section 10.1), any
claim arising under this Agreement or in connection with or as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Damages or injury alleged
to be suffered by any party as a result of the actions or failure to act by
any other party shall, unless otherwise specifically stated in this Agreement,
be governed solely and exclusively by the provisions of this Article 10. If
Seller and Purchaser cannot resolve such claim by mutual agreement, such
claim shall be determined by adjudication by a court or similar tribunal
subject to the provisions of this Article 10.



ARTICLE 11



TAX AND COST REPORT MATTERS



11.1 _Tax Matters; Allocation of Purchase Price_.



(a) After the Closing Date, the parties shall cooperate fully with each other
and shall make available to each other, as reasonably requested, all
information, records or documents relating to tax liabilities or potential tax
liabilities attributable to Seller and TRH with respect to the operation of
the Hospitals for all periods prior to the Effective Time and shall
preserve all such information, records and documents at least until the
expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or extensions thereof. The
parties shall also make available to each other as reasonably required, and at
the reasonable cost of the requesting party (for out-of-pocket costs and
expenses only), personnel responsible for preparing or maintaining
information, records and documents in connection with tax matters.



(b) The Purchase Price shall be allocated among each category of the Assets
and among each of the Hospitals in accordance with Schedule 11.1(b). Seller
and Purchaser hereby agree to allocate the Purchase Price in accordance with
Schedule 11.1(b), to be bound by such allocations, to account for and report
the purchase and sale of the Assets contemplated hereby for federal and state
tax purposes in accordance with such allocations, and not to take any position
(whether in tax returns, tax audits, or other tax proceedings), which is
inconsistent with such allocations without the prior written consent of the
other parties. 11.2 _Cost Report Matters_.



(a) Seller shall prepare and timely file all cost reports relating to the
periods ending prior to the Effective Time (including all cost reports
relating to TRH and the TRH Businesses for the period through the Closing
Date) or required as a result of the consummation of the transactions
described in this Agreement, including, without limitation, those relating to
Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross and other third party payors which settle on a
cost report basis (the "Seller Cost Reports"). Purchaser shall (and shall
cause TRH to) forward to Seller any and all correspondence relating to the
Accounts Receivable, the Seller Cost Reports or rights to settlements and
retroactive adjustments on the Seller Cost Reports ("Agency Settlements") as
promptly as reasonably practicable following (but in no event later than
fifteen (15) business days of) receipt by Purchaser or TRH. Such
correspondence shall include the final notices for State of Missouri fiscal
year ending June 30, 2004 from Missouri Medicaid (Division of Medical
Services) and MHA Management Services Corporation. Purchaser shall not (and
shall cause TRH to not) reply to any such correspondence without Sellers
written approval. Purchaser shall (and shall cause TRH to) remit any receipts
relating to the Accounts Receivable, the Seller Cost Reports or the Agency
Settlements (and forward any demand for payments) as promptly as reasonably
practicable following (but in no event later than fifteen (15) business days
of) receipt by Purchaser or TRH (except those receipts to be retained
by Purchaser or TRH pursuant to Section 11.3). Purchaser (and its respective
successors-in-interest, assigns and affiliates) shall have neither the right
to offset amounts payable to Seller under this Section 11.2 against, nor the
right to contest its obligation to transfer, assign and convey to Seller
because of, outstanding claims, liabilities or obligations asserted by
Purchaser against Seller including but not limited to pursuant to the post-
closing Cash Purchase Price adjustment of Section 1.4 and the indemnification
provisions of Section 10.2. If Purchaser does not remit the receipts relating
to the Accounts Receivable, the Seller Cost Reports or the Agency Settlements
to Seller in accordance with the fourth sentence of this Section 11.2(a),
such receipts shall bear interest at the Prime Rate in effect on the calendar
day upon which such payment was required to be made to Seller (the "Settlement
Due Date") plus five percent (5%) (or the maximum rate allowed by
law, whichever is less), such interest accruing on each calendar day after
the Settlement Due Date until the receipts relating to the Accounts
Receivable, the Seller Cost Reports or the Agency Settlements and all interest
thereon is made to Seller. Seller shall retain all rights to the Seller Cost
Reports and to the Accounts Receivable including, without limitation, any
payables resulting therefrom or receivables relating thereto and the right to
appeal any Medicare determinations relating to the Agency Settlements and the
Seller Cost Reports. Seller will furnish copies of the Receivables Records to
Purchaser upon request and allow Purchaser and its representatives reasonable
access to such documents.



(b) Upon reasonable notice and during normal business office hours, Purchaser
will (and shall cause TRH to) cooperate with Seller, at Sellers expense, in
regard to the preparation, filing, handling, and appeals of the Seller Cost
Reports. Upon reasonable notice and during normal business office
hours, Purchaser will (and shall cause TRH to) cooperate with Seller, at
Sellers expense, in connection with any cost report disputes and/or other
claim adjudication matters relative to governmental program reimbursement.
Such cooperation shall include the providing of statistics and obtaining
files at the Hospitals as reasonably requested and the coordination with
Seller pursuant to adequate notice of Medicare and Medicaid exit conferences
or meetings. 11.3 _Transition Services_. To compensate Seller for services rendered and
medicine, drugs, and supplies provided before the Effective Time at any of
the Hospitals (the "Transition Services") with respect to patients whose
medical care is paid for, in whole or in part, by Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare,
Blue Cross or any other third party payor who pays on a DRG, case rate or
other similar arrangement, and who are admitted to any of the Hospitals prior
to the Effective Time but who are not discharged until on or after the
Effective Time ("Governmental Program Transition Patients"), the parties
shall take the following action:



(a) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to
Purchaser a statement itemizing the inpatient hospital Transition Services
provided by Seller and TRH with respect to the operation of the Hospitals
prior to the Effective Time to Governmental Program Transition Patients. For
the Transition Services, Purchaser shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the
total DRG and outlier payments, the case rate payment or other similar
payment received by Purchaser and TRH after the Effective Time on behalf of a
Governmental Program Transition Patient and related to care provided prior to
and following the Effective Time, multiplied by a fraction (the "Fraction"),
the numerator of which shall be the total charges for the Transition Services
provided to such Governmental Program Transition Patient by Seller and TRH
prior to the Effective Time and the denominator of which shall be the sum of
the total charges for the Transition Services provided to such Governmental
Program Transition Patient by Seller and TRH prior to the Effective Time plus
the total charges for the Transition Services provided to such Governmental
Program Transition Patient by Purchaser and TRH on and after the Effective
Time. The parties shall reconcile the payments within ninety (90) calendar
days after both the tentative and final Medicare cost report settlement and
any other payor settlement affecting the Governmental Program Transition
Patients (the "Reconciliation").



(b) Subject to Section 11.3(d), payments made pursuant to Section 11.3(a)
shall be made to Seller monthly, on the twenty-fifth (25th) day of each month,
for payments received by Purchaser and TRH during the previous month,
accompanied by copies of remittances and other supporting documentation as is
reasonably requested by Seller. Any other payments required to be made by
Seller to Purchaser, or by Purchaser to Seller, as the case may be, as a
result of (i) the Reconciliation, (ii) a notice of program reimbursement with
respect to the operations of any Hospital or (iii) other notice from a
governmental agency or third party payor with respect to Transition Services
shall be made within thirty (30) calendar days after the Reconciliation or
the receipt of any such notice, as applicable. In the event that Purchaser and
Seller are unable to agree on the amount to be paid to Seller or Purchaser, as
the case may be, under this Section 11.3, then such amount shall
be determined by the Independent Auditor at their joint expense.



(c) The parties acknowledge that all charges for outpatient and other cost-
based services shall be made (i) by Seller (and, as applicable, TRH) for all
periods prior to the Effective Time and (ii) by Purchaser (and, as
applicable, TRH) for all periods on and after the Effective Time.



(d) Notwithstanding the first sentence of Section 11.3(b), Purchaser shall
make a distribution to Seller within three (3) business days if at any time
during the applicable calendar month the funds to be distributed to Seller
pursuant to Section 11.3(a) exceed One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($150,000). The amount of such distribution shall be all amounts payable to Seller pursuant to Section 11.3(a) which have not been
previously distributed to Seller. All such distributions shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to Seller to the account(s)
specified by Seller to Purchaser in writing from time to time.



(e) Purchaser (and its respective successors-in-interest, assigns and
affiliates) shall have neither the right to offset amounts payable to Seller
under this Section 11.3 against, nor the right to contest its obligation to
transfer, assign and convey to Seller because of, outstanding claims,
liabilities or obligations asserted by Purchaser against Seller including but
not limited to pursuant to the post-closing Cash Purchase Price adjustment of
Section 1.4 and the indemnification provisions of Section 10.2. If Purchaser
does not remit to Seller the amounts payable to Seller pursuant to Section
11.3(b) or 11.3(d) in accordance with the terms thereof, such amounts shall
bear interest at the Prime Rate in effect on the calendar day upon which such
payment was required to be made to Seller (the "Straddle Payment Due
Date") plus five percent (5%) (or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever
is less), such interest accruing on each calendar day after the Straddle

Agreements"), which Superseded Agreements shall be of no further force or
effect.



12.15 _No Waiver_. Any term, covenant or condition of this Agreement may be
waived at any time by the party which is entitled to the benefit thereof but
only by a written notice signed by the party expressly waiving such term or
condition. The subsequent acceptance of performance hereunder by a party shall
not be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding breach by any other party of
any term, covenant or condition of this Agreement, other than the failure of
such other party to perform the particular duties so accepted, regardless of
the accepting partys knowledge of such preceding breach at the time
of acceptance of such performance. The waiver of any term, covenant or
