                                STOCK SALE

         2.1    Purchase and Sale of Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement and on the basis of and in reliance upon the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, at the
Closing Seller shall grant, sell, transfer and deliver to Buyer the entire
right, title and interest of Seller in and to, and Buyer shall purchase from
Seller, the Shares, free and clear of all Liens.

         2.2    Purchase Price.

         (a)    In consideration of the Stock Sale and the transactions
contemplated hereby and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Buyer will pay to Seller an aggregate amount of cash equal to $1,650,000,000
(the "Base Purchase Price"), minus (i) the aggregate amount of all Excluded
Cellular Interest Amounts (as so adjusted, the "Adjusted Purchase Price"), plus
(ii) Estimated Net Working Capital, if such amount is positive (or minus
Estimated Net Working Capital, if such amount is negative), minus (iii) the
amount, if any, by which the Targeted Capital Expenditure Amount exceeds the
Estimated Capital Expenditure Amount and minus (iv) the amount, if any, by which
the Targeted Sales Acquisition Cost exceeds the Estimated Sales Acquisition Cost
(the Adjusted Purchase Price, as adjusted for items (ii), (iii) and (iv), the
"Estimated Purchase Price"). The Base Purchase Price is equal to the sum of the
Agreed Values of all Cellular Interests. The Estimated Purchase Price shall be
subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.3 (as adjusted, the "Purchase
Price"). The Estimated Purchase Price shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in U.S. dollars to an account to be designated by
Seller in writing to Buyer no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date.

         (b)    Not less than 14 calendar days prior to the Closing Date,
Seller will deliver to Buyer (i) a written statement (with appropriate
supporting documentation) of its good faith calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital (the "Estimated Net Working Capital"), the Capital Expenditure Amount
through the Closing Date (the "Estimated Capital Expenditure Amount"), and the
Sales Acquisition Cost (the "Estimated Sales Acquisition Cost") with Estimated
Net Working Capital and Estimated Sales Acquisition Cost to be calculated on a
basis consistent with the accounting principles and methodologies set forth on
Schedule 1.1(a) and (ii) the Estimated Purchase Price based thereon. Seller
shall cooperate with Buyer to provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon Seller's calculation of the Estimated Net Working
Capital, Estimated Capital Expenditure Amount and Estimated Sales Acquisition
Cost. Seller shall provide Buyer and its authorized representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours and without significant disruption to the
business of the Seller and its Affiliates and to all books, records and
employees of Seller and its Affiliates having relevant information concerning
the Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Capital Expenditure Amount and
Estimated Sales Acquisition Cost. Within 10 calendar days after receipt of
Seller's calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price, Buyer shall, in a written
notice to Seller, either accept Seller's calculation of the Estimated Purchase
Price or provide a written notice containing Buyer's good faith calculation of
the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, the Estimated Capital Expenditure
Amount and Estimated Sales Acquisition Cost and describing any objections to
Seller's calculation with particularity. If Seller shall not have received a
written notice of a revised calculation within this 10 calendar day period,
Buyer will be deemed irrevocably to have accepted Seller's calculation of the
Estimated Purchase Price. If Buyer notifies Seller of its revised calculation in
accordance with this Section, Buyer and Seller shall attempt to resolve their
differences through representatives who are duly authorized to negotiate with
respect to all differences, and any resolution by them as to disputed amounts
shall be in writing. If the parties are not able to resolve their differences
prior to the Closing Date, the parties shall use the arithmetic mean of the two
calculations of Estimated Purchase Price delivered by each of Buyer and Seller
in accordance with this Section 2.2(b) for the purposes of calculating the
Estimated Purchase Price.

         2.3    Closing Date Statement.

         (a)    Within 60 calendar days after the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer a written statement (with appropriate supporting
documentation) (collectively, the "Closing Date Statement") of the Closing Net
Working Capital, the Capital Expenditure Amount and the Sales Acquisition Cost
calculated on a basis consistent with GAAP and the accounting principles and
methodologies set forth on Schedule 1.1(a).

         (b)    Within 30 calendar days after receipt of the Closing Date
Statement, Buyer shall, in a written notice to Seller, either accept the Closing
Date Statement or describe any objections (as permitted under this Section
2.3(b) with reasonable particularity). If Seller shall not have received a
written notice of proposed adjustments within this 30 calendar day period, Buyer
will be deemed irrevocably to have accepted such Closing Date Statement. In
addition, any item included in the Closing Date Statement that is not objected
to by Buyer with reasonable particularity shall be deemed to have been
irrevocably accepted by Buyer ("Resolved Items") and any amounts included within
such item shall be deemed to be final, binding and conclusive. If Buyer notifies
Seller of its objections to the Closing Date Statement in accordance with this
Section, the parties shall, within 10 calendar days (or such longer period as
the parties may mutually agree) following such notice (the "Resolution Period"),
attempt through representatives who are duly authorized to negotiate with
respect to all outstanding differences to resolve their differences, and any
written resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding
and conclusive.

         (c)    Any amounts remaining in dispute at the conclusion of the
Resolution Period ("Unresolved Items") shall be submitted to binding arbitration
in the state of Delaware for a resolution of the Unresolved Items. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section 2.3(c), the arbitration shall be pursuant to
the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

               (i)    The arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") shall be selected by the
         parties in good faith and in a timely fashion, but in no event later
         than 10 calendar days after the expiration of the Resolution Period.
         In the event that the parties are unable to agree on the selection of
         the Arbitrator, either party may request the American Arbitration
         Association to appoint the Arbitrator. Prior to the commencement of
         hearings, the Arbitrator shall take an oath of impartiality.

                (ii)  The arbitration proceedings and all testimony, filings,
         documents and information relating to or presented during the
         arbitration proceedings shall be deemed to be information subject to
         the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement.

                (iii) Any determination rendered pursuant to this Section
         2.3(c) shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties and any
         judgment thereon may be entered and enforced in any court of competent
         jurisdiction. The Arbitrator shall set forth in writing the deter-
         mination of the Unresolved Items and a calculation of the Closing Net
         Working Capital, Capital Expenditure Amount or Sales Acquisition Cost,
         based upon the amount of Resolved Items and the Arbitrator's deter-
         minations of the Unresolved Items.

                (iv)  Unless Buyer and Seller otherwise mutually agree in
         writing, Buyer and Seller shall share the fees and expenses of the
         Arbitrator based on the following formulas: (i) Seller shall pay a
         portion of such fees and expenses equal to the total of such fees and
         expenses multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
         dollar amount of Unresolved Items resolved in favor of Buyer and the
         denominator of which is the total dollar amount of Unresolved Items;
         and (ii) Buyer shall pay a portion of fees and expenses equal to the
         total of such fees and expenses multiplied by a fraction, the
         numerator of which is the dollar amount of Unresolved Items resolved
         in favor of Seller and the denominator of which is the total dollar
         amount of Unresolved Items. Each party shall bear all the fees, costs
         and expenses of its own attorneys, experts and witnesses; provided,
         however, that in connection with any judicial proceeding to compel
         arbitration pursuant to this Agreement or to confirm, vacate or
         enforce any determination rendered pursuant to this Section 2.3(c),
         the prevailing party in such a proceeding shall be entitled to recover
         reasonable attorney's fees and expenses incurred in connection with
         such proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it may be
         entitled.

         (d)    Upon any (i) agreement or deemed agreement by Buyer and Seller
as to the Closing Net Working Capital, Capital Expenditure Amount or Sales
Acquisition Cost or (ii) the Arbitrator's determination of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Capital Expenditure Amount or Sales Acquisition Cost, the
parties shall, based thereupon, calculate the Purchase Price. If the Purchase
Price as finally determined above is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price,
Buyer shall promptly, but no later than two Business Days after such agreement
or determination, pay to Seller the amount of such difference. If the Purchase
Price as finally determined above is less than the Estimated Purchase Price,
Seller shall promptly, but no later than two Business Days after such agreement
or determination, pay to Buyer the amount of such difference.

         (e)    Any amount paid in accordance with this Section 2.3 shall bear
interest from and after the Closing Date through but excluding the date of
payment, at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Rate on the Closing Date.
Such interest shall accrue daily on the basis of a 365-day year.

         (f)    All amounts payable in accordance with this Section 2.3 shall
be paid by delivery of immediately available funds by wire transfer in U.S.
dollars to, in the case of amounts payable by Buyer, the account identified by
Seller in accordance with Section 2.2 above or an alternate account that Seller
may designate in writing or, in the case of amounts payable by Seller, to such
account as Buyer may designate in writing to Seller.

         (g)    During the period of any review or dispute as provided in this
Section 2.3, Seller shall provide Buyer and its authorized representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours and without significant
disruption to the business of Seller and its Affiliates, to all books, records
and employees of Seller and its Affiliates having relevant information
concerning the Closing Date Statement to the extent that such information was
used in the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, Capital Expenditure
Amount or Sales Acquisition Cost reflected thereon.

         2.4    Affiliate Assets.

         (a)    To the extent necessary Seller shall, and shall cause any of
its Affiliates to, transfer and assign prior to the Closing Date all of Seller's

properties and rights of every kind and description whatsoever, including,

Any transfers or other actions taken with respect to the Excluded Licenses
pursuant to this Section 2.4(b) shall be without recourse to, and shall not
impose any Liability upon, any CenturyTel Entity from and after the Closing

Authorizations are valid and in full force and effect, exclusively held by a
CenturyTel Entity or Cellular Entity, free and clear of any legal
disqualifications, conditions or other restrictions, and free and clear of all
Liens (in each case other than those customarily or routinely on such Company
Authorizations). There is not pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened
against any CenturyTel Entity and, to the Knowledge of Seller, there is not
pending or threatened against any other Cellular Entity, any application,
action, petition, objection or other pleading, or any proceeding, with the FCC
or any other Governmental Authority that challenges, questions or contests the
validity of, or any right, title and interest of the holder under, or
nonrenewal, termination, revocation, forfeiture or suspension of, any Company
Authorization. No CenturyTel Entity or, to the Knowledge of Seller, no other
Cellular Entity, is in default or has received any notice of any claim of
default, with respect to any Company Authorization. Each CenturyTel Entity and,
to the Knowledge of Seller, each other Cellular Entity has complied in all
respects with, and is not in violation of, any Requirement of Law to which the
Company Authorizations are subject, including, without limitation, rules,
regulations or orders of the FCC and any applicable State Commission. No
CenturyTel Entity or, to the Knowledge of Seller, no other Cellular Entity has
failed to adhere to the requirements, terms, conditions or restrictions of any
license, permit or authorization necessary to the ownership of the Company
Authorizations. Each CenturyTel Entity and, to the Knowledge of Seller, each
other Cellular Entity has fully and timely paid and is current in all respects
all local, state and federal fees, charges and assessments relating to the
Business and the Company Authorizations, including, without limitation, FCC
regulatory fees and universal service contributions. Except as otherwise
governed by any applicable Requirement of Law, all of the Company Authorizations
that are material to any CenturyTel Entity and, to the Knowledge of Seller, all
of the Company Authorizations that are material to any other Cellular Entity,
are renewable by their terms without the need to comply with any special
qualification procedures.

         (b)    Each of the Seller, the CenturyTel Entities, and their
respective Affiliates are currently, and have been at all times with respect to
the operation of the Business, in material compliance with (i) the Petition of
CenturyTel Wireless, Inc. for Limited Waiver as filed on September 25, 2001, as
amended, restated, modified or supplemented from time to time (collectively, the
"CenturyTel E-911 Waiver"), (ii) Section 20.18 of the Rules and Regulations of
the FCC (47 CFR Sec. 20.18) as amended or otherwise clarified by the FCC, and
(iii) the other FCC Mandates. Neither the CenturyTel Entities, nor to the
Knowledge (which will not require any investigation involving a contact or
inquiry of a Third Party) of Seller, the Cellular Entities in which the
CenturyTel Entity owns a Minority Interest have received a request from any
Public Safety Answering Point (the "PSAP") or Governmental Authority with
jurisdiction or control over a PSAP, requesting the provision of Phase II E-911
service in any area in which the CenturyTel Entities or the Cellular Entities
provide Cellular Service.

         (c)    The Company PCS Licenses disclosed on Schedule 3.13(a) are all
of the personal communication licenses that have been issued or granted to
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller for any BTA or MTA in Dubuque, Iowa or the
state of Wisconsin. All Company PCS Licenses are valid and in full force and
effect, exclusively held by the Seller or its Affiliates disclosed on Schedule
3.13(a), free and clear of any legal disqualifications, conditions or other
restrictions, and free and clear of all Liens (in each case other than those
customarily or routinely on such Company PCS Licenses). There is not pending or,
to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against Seller or any Affiliate any
application, action, petition, objection or other pleading, or any proceeding,
with the FCC or any other Governmental Authority that challenges, questions or
contests the validity of, or any right, title and interest of the holder under,
or nonrenewal, termination, revocation, forfeiture or suspension of, any Company
PCS License. Neither Seller nor any Affiliate is in default or has received any
notice of any claim of default, with respect to any Company PCS License. The
Seller and its applicable Affiliate have (A) complied in all respects with, and
are not in violation of, any Requirement of Law to which the Company PCS
Licenses are subject, including, without limitation, rules, regulations or
orders of the FCC and any applicable State Commission, (B) constructed, or will
construct no later than April 28, 2002, sufficient facilities to provide
Adequate Service to at least one-quarter of the population in each of the
licensed service areas associated with the Company PCS Licenses ("FCC
Construction Requirement") and (C) filed or will timely file, fully complete and
accurate construction notifications with the FCC certifying that it has
satisfied the FCC Construction Requirement with respect to each of the Company
PCS Licenses, and such notifications have been granted by the FCC, or to
Seller's Knowledge, will be granted by the FCC in the ordinary course ("FCC
Construction Notification Requirement"). To Knowledge of Seller, there are no
microwave relocation obligations applicable to the Company PCS Licenses that
would trigger a reimbursement obligation to an operator in the licensed service
areas associated with the Company PCS Licenses upon the initiation of service by
the licensee of the Company PCS Licenses. Except as otherwise governed by any
applicable Requirement of Law, all of the Company PCS Licenses are renewable by
their terms without the need to comply with any special qualification
procedures. The provision of Cellular Services by the CenturyTel Entities,
pursuant to a Company PCS License, does not and will not (with or without the
giving of notice or the passage of time or both) violate, conflict with or
result in the breach of any term, condition or provision of, or require the
consent or approval of or notice to any other Person, or result in the
termination, modification or cancellation of, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien, or otherwise adversely
affect the existing rights or obligations of the CenturyTel Entities under the
Cellular Agreements or any related Requirement of Law.

         3.14   Employee Benefit Plans.

         (a)    Schedule 3.14(a) lists (and identifies the sponsor of) each
(i) Employee Pension Benefit Plan, (ii) Employee Welfare Benefit Plan and (iii)
other material retirement, pension, profit-sharing, money purchase, deferred
compensation, incentive compensation, bonus, stock option, stock purchase,

post-retirement medical, accident, disability, weekly income, salary
continuation, health, life or other insurance, fringe benefit, or other employee
benefit plan, program, agreement, contract, commitment or arrangement, in each
case in the foregoing clauses (i) to (iii), maintained or contributed to by
Seller or any of its Affiliates in respect of or for the benefit of any Eligible
Employee or Leave Recipient, excluding any such plan, program, agreement, or
arrangement maintained or contributed to solely in respect of or for the benefit
of Eligible Employees, Leave Recipients or employees employed or formerly
employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates outside of the United States
(collectively, the "Plans"). Schedule 3.14(a) also lists each written
employment, severance, termination or similar-type agreement between Seller or
any of its Affiliates and any Eligible Employee or Leave Recipient (the
"Employment Agreement"), and each agreement, contract, commitment or arrangement
between Seller or any of its Affiliates and any collective bargaining or other
employee representative or labor union for any Eligible Employee or Leave
Recipient (the "Labor Contracts"). Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.14(a), the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller and the performance of this
Agreement by Seller or any of its Affiliates will not result now or at any time
in the future in the payment to any employee who, upon the Closing, will be an
Eligible Employee or Leave Recipient of any severance, termination, or similar
payments or benefits.

         (b)    Each Plan (and each related trust, insurance contract, or fund)
has been maintained, funded and administered in all material respects in
accordance with the terms of such Plan and complies in all material respects in
form and in operation with the applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code.

         (c)    All contributions (including all employer contributions and
employee salary reduction contributions), which are due, have been made to each
Plan that is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan. All premiums or other payments
that are due have been paid with respect to each Plan that is an Employee
Welfare Benefit Plan.

         (d)    Each Plan which is intended to meet the requirements of a
"qualified plan" under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination
letter from the IRS to the effect that it meets the requirements of Section
401(a) of the Code.

         (e)    Since January 1, 1999, there has been no reportable event (as
such term is defined in Section 403(b) of ERISA) or prohibited transactions
(as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA) with respect to any Plan. No
withdrawal liability has been incurred by or asserted against any CenturyTel
Entity with respect to any "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan"). No CenturyTel Entity contributes to any
Multiemployer
Plan.

         (f)    As of the last day of the most recent prior plan year, the
market value of assets under each Plan which is an Employee Pension Benefit
Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plan) equaled or exceeded the present value
of Liabilities thereunder (determined in accordance with then current funding
assumptions). No Plan has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency within the
meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.

         3.15   Real Property.

         (a)    Schedule 3.15(a) lists all real property and interests in real

disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of the Business
consistent with past practices (the "Real Property"). Schedule 3.15(a) specifies
the CenturyTel Entity owning, leasing, operating or using the Real Property, the
address, legal description or other description reasonably suitable to identify
the Real Property, a reasonable description (by category) of the use of such
Real Property, whether the Real Property is owned, leased, operated or used and
with respect to leased Real Property, the identity of the lessor.

         (b)    Each CenturyTel Entity purporting to own or lease Real Property
has good, valid and marketable title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, such
Real Property, free and clear of all Liens and other encumbrances and defects of
title of any nature whatsoever, except for Permitted Liens and Liens disclosed
on Schedule 3.15(b). No Person other than the CenturyTel Entity identified as
the owner on Schedule 3.15(a) owns any interest in any Real Property, except
with respect to the leased Real Property disclosed on Schedule 3.15(a), and all
Real Property is in the possession and subject to the control of a CenturyTel
Entity.

         that certain Assets reflected on such listing which are immaterial,
         individually and in the aggregate, may be required to be removed from
         the listing in accordance with GAAP due to the fact that such Assets
         have been fully depreciated and have no book value or have been
         retired.

                (iv)  Each of the Schedules referenced in this Section 3.16

         provide notice to each First  Refusal Right Holder (or other Person
         entitled to notice) in the form of notice attached hereto as Schedule
         5.5(b)(i) that applies to each particular First Refusal Right (the
         "Offer  Notice") in accordance  with the terms and conditions of this
         Section 5.5. The Seller shall deliver the Offer Notice to the First
         Refusal Holders on the date specified in writing by Buyer, which date
         Buyer agrees will be the earliest date, in its reasonable determina-
         tion, on which the Offer Notice should be delivered to the applicable
         First Refusal Right Holders so as to minimize the risk that any waiver
         or termination obtained for any related First Refusal Right will lapse
         or no longer be effective on the anticipated Closing Date. Unless
         otherwise  required  by the  terms of a First  Refusal  Right,  Seller
         shall  not, and shall cause its Affiliate not to, deliver  any Offer
         Notice until Seller and Buyer have agreed upon the date at which such
         Offer Notice should be delivered to the First Refusal Right Holder.

                (ii)  Each Offer Notice will be accompanied by the purchase
         agreement that applies to each particular First Refusal Right in the
         form attached hereto as Schedule 5.5(b)(ii) that provides the terms
         and conditions on which any First Refusal Right Holder will be
         entitled to purchase any portion or all of a Cellular Interest
         pursuant to a First Refusal Right.

                (iii) The Offer Price contained in each Offer Notice will be
         determined by multiplying (A) times (B), where (A) is the First
         Refusal Percentage of the applicable First Refusal Right Holder and
         (B) is the Agreed Value of the applicable Cellular Interest.

         (c)    Responses from First Refusal Right Holders.

                (i)   Seller will immediately advise Buyer of any notices or
         communications (whether written or oral) and provide any copies of
         notices or communications received by Seller or any of its Affiliates
         in response to an Offer Notice or otherwise related to a First Refusal
         Right.

                (ii)  In the event that Seller or any of its Affiliates is
         required to deliver any subsequent Offer Notices to First Refusal
         Right Holders or other Persons in addition to the original Offer
         Notice specified in Section 5.5(b), Seller agrees, and shall cause
         each of its Affiliates to, provide such notice in the form of notice
         attached hereto as Schedule 5.5(c) that applies to each particular
         First Refusal Right.

                (iii) In the event that Seller is required to recalculate the
         Offer Price payable by any First Refusal Right Holder due to the
         presence of over-subscription or similar rights that are triggered if
         any other First Refusal Right Holder fails to purchase its propor-
         tionate share of any Cellular Interests subject to a First Refusal
         Right, then Seller will prepare a revised calculation of such Offer
         Price and obtain Buyer's written approval, which will not be
         unreasonably withheld, of such calculation prior to distributing any
         notice containing such revised Offer Price in accordance with Section
         5.5(c)(ii).

         (d)    First Refusal Exercises.


                (i)   As used in this Agreement, a "First Refusal Exercise"
         shall have occurred with respect to a First Refusal Right if the
         First RefusalRight Holder has exercised its First Refusal Right in
         accordance with all terms and conditions of such First Refusal Right,
         including, without limitation, any terms and conditions specified in
         the Cellular Agreement that must be fulfilled or satisfied in order
         for the First Refusal Right Holder to be entitled to all or any
         portion of a Cellular Interest in accordance therewith. If there is
         any question or uncertainty as to whether a First Refusal Exercise has
         occurred, the  Buyer's determination, in the  exercise  of  its
         reasonable judgment, of any such question or uncertainty shall
         control for all purposes of this Agreement.

                (ii)  In the event of the occurrence of a First Refusal
         Exercise, the following provisions will apply to the affected
         Cellular Interests:

                      (A)  any portion of a Cellular Interest subject
                           to a First Refusal Exercise shall not be
                           considered to be a Cellular Interest for the
                           purposes of this Agreement and shall be
                           deemed to be an "Excluded Cellular
                           Interest";

                      (B)  if a portion but not all of the Cellular
                           Interests held by one or more CenturyTel
                           Entities (or other Affiliates) is subject to
                           the First Refusal Exercise, Buyer shall have
                           the right (but not the obligation), in its
                           sole discretion, to designate any or all of
                           the remaining portion of the Cellular
                           Interest to also be an Excluded Cellular
                           Interest.

                      (iii) With respect to any Excluded Cellular Interest,
         Seller will be obligated as soon as practicable, but in any event
         prior to Closing, to transfer the following assets, properties and
         rights (which shall be deemed to be Excluded Assets for purposes of
         this Agreement) to an Affiliate of Seller that is not a CenturyTel
         Entity (which transfer will be without recourse to, and shall impose
         no Liability upon, any CenturyTel Entity from and after the Closing
         Date or upon Buyer and its Affiliates at any time):

                      (A)  the Excluded Cellular Interest;

                      (B)  any management, service or other agreements,
                           commitments or arrangements to which any
                           CenturyTel Entity is a party or bound
                           thereby related to the Excluded Cellular
                           Interest.

         With respect to any agreement, commitment or arrangement described in
         clause (B) immediately above for which the Seller and its Affiliates
         will not be able to perform their obligations due to the Stock Sale
         after the Closing Date without the benefit of certain assets,
         properties or rights of the Business and to the extent the Buyer is
         able to perform such obligations as a result of the Stock Sale, the
         Buyer agrees to provide to Seller for a period of up to three months
         after the Closing Date any services necessary for Seller to perform its
         obligations on the same terms and conditions that would apply to such
         services under the Transition Services Agreement (as if Buyer were the
         "Providing Party" thereunder and Seller were the "Receiving Party"
         thereunder).

                (iv)  With respect to each Excluded Cellular Interest, the Base
         Purchase Price shall be reduced in accordance with Section 2.2 by an
         amount equal to all Excluded Cellular Interest Amounts.

                (v)   Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably apprised of all
         developments with respect to the disposition of any Excluded Cellular
         Interest, and Seller shall not (and shall not allow any Affiliate to)
         amend or modify the terms and conditions of any agreement, contract or
         commitment to dispose of any Excluded Cellular Interest without the
         prior written consent of Buyer, which consent may be withheld at
         Buyer's sole discretion.

                (vi)  If a First Refusal Right Holder fails to consummate the
         purchase of all (but not less than all) of the Excluded Cellular
         Interest in a Cellular Entity within 120 days after the Closing Date,
         Buyer shall have the obligation to purchase all of such Excluded
         Cellular Interests in accordance with this Agreement. In all other
         instances in which a First Refusal Right Holder fails to consummate
         the purchase of an Excluded Cellular Interest, Buyer shall have the
         right (but not the obligation), in Buyer's sole discretion, to
         purchase all or any portion of any such Excluded Cellular Interest in
         accordance with this Agreement.

         (e)    No Liability to Buyer; Indemnification. Subject to the last
sentence of this Section 5.5(e), Buyer shall have no Liability, before or after
Closing and without regard to any termination of this Agreement, with respect to
any First Refusal Right or Excluded Cellular Interest. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and in addition to the indemnification obligations
of Seller set forth elsewhere herein, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Buyer Indemnitee against and in respect of any and all Losses or
Taxes incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnitee that result from, relate to
or arise out of (i) First Refusal Rights, (ii) Excluded Cellular Interests and
any related Excluded Assets, and (iii) any and all actions, suits, claims,
proceedings, investigations, demands, assessments, audits, fines, judgments,
costs and other expenses incident to any of the foregoing or to the enforcement
of this Section. The provisions of this Section 5.5 will survive indefinitely
the Closing or termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.5(e), if the Closing occurs and Seller was deemed
at Closing to have waived the condition to Closing regarding First Refusal
Rights in accordance with the last sentence of Section 6.2(c), Seller shall have
no obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee with respect to any Losses or
Taxes that result from, relate to or arise out of the deemed waiver of such
condition in Section 6.2(c).

         (f)    Other Rights of First Refusal. If Seller or any of its
Affiliates receives a notice from any Person that provides Seller or any of its
Affiliates with notice of a right of first refusal or other similar right to
purchase or acquire any Third-Party Interest, Seller will immediately provide a
copy to Buyer of any such notice and any additional supporting documentation
that Buyer may reasonably request. Within ten Business Days of Buyer's receipt
of such notice, Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation) in Buyer's
sole discretion to provide instructions to Seller as to whether or not to
exercise the right of first refusal or similar right, and Seller shall (and
shall cause its Affiliates to) respond to the holder of the Third-Party Interest
in accordance with Buyer's instructions and shall use any form of response
provided to Seller by Buyer for such purpose. Seller will immediately provide a
copy to Buyer of any written notices or communications received by Seller or any
of its Affiliates in connection with the Third-Party Interest or right of first
refusal or similar interest. If Buyer elects for Seller or its applicable
Affiliate to purchase such Third-Party Interest, Seller will provide Buyer with
reasonable opportunity to review and approve in advance in writing any notices
or communications to the holder of the Third-Party Interest, including, without
limitation, any proposed purchase agreement to govern the purchase of the
Third-Party Interest. If there is a purchase of a Third-Party Interest pursuant
to this Section 5.5(f) pending at the Closing, Seller will (and will cause its
Affiliates to) take all actions necessary to cause the right to purchase the
Third-Party Interest to be held by a CenturyTel Entity at the Closing. If a
purchase of a Third-Party Interest pursuant to this Section 5.5(f) has been
consummated at or prior to the Closing, the parties agree that the Base Purchase
Price and the Agreed Value shall be increased by the amount of any payments
approved by Buyer in writing and made by Seller or its Affiliates to the holder
of the Third-Party Interests, and the Third-Party Interests will thereafter be
considered Cellular Interests for which Buyer will assume Control at the
Closing.

         5.6    Unbundling. Following the Closing, the parties shall unbundle
the subscribers set forth on Schedule 3.32 and the related subscriber agreements
in accordance with the provisions set forth on Schedule 5.6.

         5.7    Notification of Certain Matters.

         (a)    Seller shall give prompt written notice to Buyer of (i) the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event or circumstance which would be
reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in Article 3
to be untrue or inaccurate on the Closing Date and (ii) any failure of Seller to
comply in any material respect with any covenant or agreement to be complied
with at or prior to Closing.

         (b)    Buyer shall give prompt written notice to Seller of (i) the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event or circumstance which would be
reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in Article 4
to be untrue or inaccurate on the Closing Date and (ii) any failure of Buyer to
comply in any material respect with any covenant or agreement to be complied
with at or prior to Closing.

         (c)    Buyer shall give prompt written notice to Seller if the Buyer
obtains Knowledge after the date of this Agreement of (i) the occurrence or
nonoccurrence of any event or circumstance which would cause any representation
or warranty contained in Article 3 to be untrue or inaccurate on the Closing
Date or (ii) any failure of Seller to comply in any material respect with any
covenant or agreement to be complied with at or prior to Closing, the effect of
which in each case under the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) would cause a
condition to Closing in Article 6 to not be satisfied. The Buyer shall not have
any obligation to provide notice under this Section 5.7(c) unless the
occurrence, nonoccurrence or failure in question (y) clearly and demonstrably,
without the requirement of any independent investigation, constitutes a breach
of an express term of this Agreement and (z) relates to or arises out of an act,
event or circumstance that occurs after the date of this Agreement. In no event
shall Buyer's obligation under this Section 5.7(c) include any obligation to
provide notice under this Section 5.7(c) related to the contents of the
Schedules to this Agreement.

         (d)    The delivery of any notice in accordance with this Section 5.7
shall not be deemed to (i) modify the representations or warranties hereunder
of either party, (ii) modify any condition to closing set forth in Article 6 or
(iii) limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to either
party.

         5.8    Satisfaction of Conditions. Without limiting the generality or
effect of any provision of Article 5, the parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to satisfy promptly all the conditions required to be satisfied prior to
the Closing under Article 6.

         5.9    Cooperation. Without limiting the terms and conditions of this
Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement, (a) Buyer and Seller shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate with the other in order to
facilitate the orderly transfer and transition of the ownership and operation of
the Business, (b) Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, (i)
give Buyer and its employees, agents and representatives reasonable access
during all reasonable times to the books and records, facilities and assets of
the CenturyTel Entities and Cellular Entities or used in the Business, (ii)
provide such financial and operating data and other information as Buyer may
reasonably request and (iii) make available, at and for reasonable locations and
times, each of the officers, employees, agents and representatives of Seller and
its Affiliates in order to facilitate transfer and transitional matters and (c)
Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, grant Buyer and its
employees, agents and representatives reasonable access to the respective
officers, employees, agents and representatives of Seller and its Affiliates who
can respond knowledgeably to questions related to the CenturyTel Entities and
Cellular Entities, the Business, and transfer and transitional matters.

         5.10   CenturyTel Entities.

         (a)    Subject to the terms and conditions of the Transition
Services Agreement, Buyer and Seller agree that Seller shall, and shall cause
each of its Affiliates to, terminate effective as of the Closing Date without
Liability to the CenturyTel Entities, the Cellular Entities, Buyer or the

to the date of such termination), all of the rights and obligations of the

(other than trade payables for which Buyer receives an adjustment to the
Purchase Price in accordance with Article 2), any Liabilities secured by any
Existing Liens (other than Permitted Liens), and any Intercompany Payables prior
to the Closing Date, other than Current Liabilities for which the Buyer receives
an adjustment to the Purchase Price in accordance with Article 2.

         5.11   Capital Expenditures. Seller shall cause the CenturyTel
Entities to make (and pay in full prior to Closing) capital expenditures with
respect to the Business required to support normal maintenance and customer
growth in a manner consistent with the expenditure budgets attached hereto as
Schedule 5.11 (the "Capital Expenditure Budget"). Capital Expenditures incurred
by the CenturyTel Entities with respect to the Business from January 1, 2002
until the Closing Date in accordance with the Capital Expenditure Budget are
referred to as the "Capital Expenditure Amount."

         5.12   Exclusivity. Except as contemplated by Section 5.5, neither
Seller nor any CenturyTel Entity shall (and Seller shall not cause or permit
any of its Affiliates or any CenturyTel Entity or Cellular Entity to) (i)

discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish any information with respect to,
assist or participate in or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt

will immediately provide Buyer with a copy (or, if not in writing, a written
description of the terms and other details) of such proposal, offer, inquiry or
contact. Notwithstanding clause (ii) of this Section 5.12, a change of Control
of Seller by way of merger, consolidation or reorganization in which the Seller
is a constituent corporation or party to such transaction shall not be
prohibited by this Section if the successor corporation or entity (and, if the
successor corporation or entity is not the ultimate parent corporation or entity
as a result of such transaction, the ultimate parent corporation or entity)
expressly assumes in writing all of Seller's obligations under and agrees to
comply with this Agreement.

         5.13   SEC Basis Financial Statements. Following a request by Buyer,

         (a)    Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to,

         (f)    In the event this Agreement shall terminate prior to Closing or
in the event the Buyer or its Affiliates has done Network Construction with
respect to a part of the Business for which the Buyer will not assume Control
because the related Cellular Interest has become an Excluded Cellular Interest

its Affiliates to, cooperate with Buyer, and each shall use its reasonable best
efforts in transferring ownership and possession to Buyer of equipment owned or
possessed by Seller or any of its Affiliates, but paid for by Buyer or its

amounts and at such intervals as is consistent with its past practice.

         5.18   Asset Listing.

         (a)    For the purpose of this Agreement, the Assets shall include
all assets, properties or rights reflected on the books and records of the
CenturyTel Entities at any time on or after January 1, 2001 (other than Assets
sold, retired or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and consistent with this Agreement since January
1, 2001), regardless of the use or location of such assets, properties and
rights.

         (b)    At least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date (or such
other date as the parties may mutually agree in writing), Seller shall deliver
to Buyer a list (the "Asset Listing"), current as of the date of delivery of
such list, of (i) substantially all of the Assets, (ii) all Affiliate Assets,
and (iii) any other assets, properties or rights that have been used in the
Business since January 1, 2001 but have been excluded from the categories of
Assets or Affiliate Assets because Seller believes such assets, properties and
rights fail to satisfy the criteria specified in Section 5.18(a) and are not
used primarily in the Business. Seller shall provide Buyer with reasonable
opportunity to review and approve the Asset Listing and to request that any item
classified as an excluded asset, property or right be reclassified as either an
Asset or an Affiliate Asset. In the case of any item that Buyer requests to be
reclassified, if the parties are unable to agree on the reclassification of any
such assets, properties or rights and the classification of such items are not
addressed by the provisions of Section 5.18(a), the excluded asset, property or
right in question shall be deemed to be an Affiliate Asset or Asset, as
applicable, if the employee or employees of Seller or its Affiliate who were the
predominant users of such asset, property or right during the period after
January 1, 2001 were Eligible Employees. At the Closing, the parties shall agree
in writing upon the final Asset Listing that has been updated in accordance with
this Section 5.18, and such final Asset Listing shall be binding upon the
parties as to the classifications of the assets, properties and rights thereon
as either Excluded Assets, Affiliate Assets or Assets, as applicable.

         (c)    If Seller or its Affiliates retain any Asset following the
Closing Date that the Buyer reasonably determines is necessary for the operation
of the Business and the Buyer submits a written request to Seller with respect
to such Asset on or before the six month anniversary of the Closing Date under
this Section 5.7(c), the Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliate
to, enter into an arrangement, reasonably satisfactory and with no additional
cost or expense to Buyer, designed to provide Buyer with the benefits of such
Asset so that the Buyer may conduct the Business following the Closing in a
manner consistent with the conduct of the Business during the twelve month
period ending December 31, 2001. The term of any arrangement under this
Agreement shall not exceed twelve months. The rights available to Buyer under
this Section 5.7(c) shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies
available to Buyer under this Agreement.

         5.19   Acknowledgements.

         (a)    As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but
in no event later than 60 days after the date hereof), Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain a waiver in the form attached hereto as
Schedule 5.19 or such other form approved in writing by Buyer, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld (the "Acknowledgement") with respect to each
Cellular Interest listed on Schedule 5.19 from the holder of each Third Party
Interest in each related Cellular Entity.

         (b)    Seller will immediately advise Buyer of any notices or
communications (whether written or oral) and provide any copies of notices or
communications received by Seller or any of its Affiliates in response to
request for an Acknowledgement or otherwise related to an Acknowledgement.

         (c)    In the event the Seller fails to obtain any Acknowledgement
with respect to any portion of a Cellular Interest in accordance with Section
5.19(a), Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation), in the exercise of
its sole discretion, to notify Seller in writing of the Buyer's election to
designate all of the Cellular Interests in the affected Cellular Entity as an
Excluded Cellular Interest for all purposes under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, Section 5.5(e)).

         (d)    With respect to any such Excluded Cellular Interest, Seller
will be obligated as soon as practicable, but in any event prior to Closing, to
transfer the following assets, properties and rights (which shall be deemed to
be Excluded Assets for purposes of this Agreement) to an Affiliate of Seller
that is not a CenturyTel Entity (which transfer will be without recourse to, and
shall impose no Liability upon, any CenturyTel Entity from and after the Closing
Date or Buyer and its Affiliates at any time):

                (i)   the Excluded Cellular Interest;

                (ii)  any management, service or other agreements, commitments
         or arrangements to which any CenturyTel Entity is a party or bound
         thereby related to the Excluded Cellular Interest.

         With respect to any agreement, commitment or arrangement described in
         clause (B) immediately above for which the Seller and its Affiliates
         will not be able to perform their obligations due to the Stock Sale
         after the Closing Date without the benefit of certain assets,
         properties or rights of the Business and to the extent the Buyer is
         able to perform such obligations as a result of the Stock Sale, the
         Buyer agrees to provide to Seller for a period of up to three months
         after the Closing Date any services necessary for Seller to perform its
         obligations on the same terms and conditions that would apply to such
         services under the Transition Services Agreement (as if Buyer were the
         "Providing Party" thereunder and Seller were the "Receiving Party"
         thereunder).

         (e)    With respect to each Excluded Cellular Interest, the Base
Purchase Price shall be reduced in accordance with Section 2.2 by an amount
equal to all Excluded Cellular Interest Amounts.

         are identified on Schedule 7.1(a) (the "Eligible Employees") shall
         become the responsibility of Buyer and its Affiliates as of the
         Effective Time in the same or comparable positions, and at the same or
         comparable total compensation as described on Schedule 7.1(a).

                (iii) All Transition Employees shall become the responsibility
         of the Buyer and its Affiliates as of the termination date of the
         services provided by such employees under the Transition Services
         Agreement (the "Transition Employee Conversion Date") in the same or
         comparable positions, and at the same or comparable total compensation
         as described on Schedule 7.1(a).

                (iv)  Buyer or its Affiliates also shall employ any Leave
         Recipient identified on Schedule 7.1(a), provided such Leave Recipient
         returns to active employment within one year after the Closing Date
         and in accordance with the other requirements of Section 7.1(c).

                (v)   Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly
         or indirectly, solicit for employment, hire or retain, as an employee
         or consultant, any of the Transferred Employees or Leave Recipients

Recipient, and Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall offer employment to any such
Leave Recipient who is able to return to active work and who has a legal,

Employee under this Agreement and the following provisions shall apply: (x) the
Leave Recipient shall cease to be eligible for coverage and benefits under any
employee benefit plans or programs maintained by Seller (except to the extent,
if any, that such coverage and benefits are required by this Agreement); (y) the
Leave Recipient shall become eligible for coverage and benefits under any
employee benefit plans or programs maintained by Buyer or its applicable
Affiliate under the same terms and conditions that apply to other Transferred
Employees; (z) the Leave Recipient's period of leave shall be treated as a
period of service under the employee benefit plans and programs of Buyer or its
applicable Affiliate to the same extent as if the Leave Recipient received
benefits under a similar plan or insurance or was subject to a similar policy of
Buyer or its applicable Affiliate; provided, however, that to the extent
permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, Buyer and its Affiliates shall not
be required to credit any Leave Recipient with such service for purposes of
benefit accrual or contributions under any pension plan, profit sharing plan,
savings plan, or other deferred compensation plan.

         (d)    All Eligible Employees, Transition Employees and Leave
Recipients are identified on Schedule 7.1(a) by name, annual compensation,
incentive compensation target, service date, employment status (conforming in
the case of Leave Recipients to the categories set forth in Section 7.1(b)(ii)),
job title, job location and collective bargaining unit status as of the date of
this Agreement. Seller shall deliver an updated Schedule 7.1(a) to Buyer at
least once every sixty (60) calendar days after the date of this Agreement, and

terminated employees or other changes or corrections to the information

Seller's operation of the Business in accordance with Section 5.4.

         7.2    Assumption of Agreements; Severance.

         (a)    On and after the Closing Date, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or in Schedule 7.2(b), the CenturyTel Entities or Buyer and its
Affiliates, as successor employer to Affiliates of Seller (subject to Seller's
Retained Liabilities in Sections 7.4 and 7.7(b)(i)), shall continue to be bound
by or shall assume all obligations under and be bound by the provisions of each
Employment Agreement disclosed on Schedule 3.14(a).

         (b)    From the Closing Date (or, in the case of Transition Employees,
the Transition Employee Conversion Date) through the first anniversary of the
Closing Date (or, in the case of Transition Employees, the Transition Employee
Conversion Date), Transferred Employees shall be eligible for benefits under a
Buyer or an Affiliate severance or separation pay policy or plan comparable in
amount to the severance or separation pay benefits that are described on
Schedule 7.2(b), and such benefits may be provided in the manner and under the
plan or policy designated by Buyer in its sole discretion.

         7.3    Recognition of Transferred Employee Service. On and after the
Closing Date (or, in the case of Transition Employees, the Transition Employee
Conversion Date), Buyer shall recognize the service of each Transferred Employee
for all employment-related purposes (other than an employee achievement award,
within the meaning of Section 274(j) of the Code) determined in accordance with
the employee benefit policies, plans, arrangements, programs, practices and
agreements of the Seller Group in effect on the Closing Date, as if such service
had been rendered to Buyer, unless any other provision of this Article provides
for an alternative method of determination. Schedule 7.1(a) may be conclusively
relied upon by Buyer in crediting prior service in accordance with this Section.
Buyer shall be required to credit Transferred Employees with prior service for
purposes of vesting and participation under the Buyer Pension Plan, the Buyer
Defined Contribution and Savings Plans, and other Buyer deferred compensation
plans, but shall not be required to credit Transferred Employees with prior
service for purposes of benefit accrual under any of such plans.

         7.4    Payment of Bonuses. Seller shall retain or assume the
obligation to pay to the Transferred Employees bonuses with respect to the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs on a pro rata basis for the portion of
the calendar year on and prior to the Closing Date (or, in the case of
Transition Employees, the Transition Employee Conversion Date), such bonuses to
be paid in the ordinary course. Buyer shall not assume any obligation to pay any
bonuses to the Transferred Employees, except as required by Section 7.1(a). In
determining any bonuses payable to the Transferred Employees for services
rendered after the Closing Date (or, in the case of Transition Employees, the
Transition Employee Conversion Date), Buyer shall comply with the provisions of
Section 7.1.

         7.5    No Duplicate Benefits; Dependents and Beneficiaries. Nothing
in this Agreement shall cause duplicate benefits to be paid or provided to or
with respect to a Transferred Employee under any employee benefit policies,
plans, arrangements, programs, practices, or agreements. References herein to a
benefit with respect to a Transferred Employee shall include, where applicable,
benefits with respect to any eligible dependents and beneficiaries of such
Transferred Employee under the same employee benefit policy, plan, arrangement,
program, practice or agreement.

         7.6    Transferred Employee Benefit Matters.

         (a)    As of the date of this Agreement, Transferred Employees
participate in one or more of the following Employee Pension Benefit Plans
maintained by Seller in the United States:

                (i)   CenturyTel Retirement Plan;

                (ii)  CenturyTel, Inc. Dollars & Sense Plan; and

                (iii) CenturyTel, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan.

         The plans identified in this Section 7.6(a) shall be referred to
collectively in this Agreement as the "Seller Pension Plans."

         (b)    Seller shall, to the extent necessary, take all appropriate
action to vest the Transferred Employees 100% in each Seller Pension Plan and to
treat each Transferred Employee as a terminated employee under the terms of each
such plan.

         (c)    Buyer agrees as follows:

                (i)   Defined Benefit Plan. Effective immediately after the
         Closing Date (or, in the case of Transition Employees, the Transition
         Employee Conversion Date), all Transferred Employees will be eligible
         to participate under a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan
         established or maintained by ALLTEL (the "Buyer Pension Plan") to the
         same extent (if any) as similarly situated Buyer employees.

                (ii)  Defined Contribution Savings Plan. Effective immediately
         after the Closing Date (or, in the case of Transition Employees, the
         Transition Employee Conversion Date), all Transferred Employees will
         be eligible to participate in a tax-qualified defined contribution
         savings plan maintained by ALLTEL (the "Buyer Defined Contribution
         and Savings Plans") to the same extent (if any) as similarly situated
         Buyer employees.

                (iii) Amendments. The benefits for Transferred Employees under
         (c)(i) and (c)(ii) above may not be amended or modified unless such
         benefits are correspondingly amended or modified with respect to all
         similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates.

                (iv)  No Transfer of Assets or Liabilities. No assets or
         Liabilities of any of the Seller Pension Plans or any other Employee
         Pension Benefit Plans maintained by Seller or any of its Affiliates
         or otherwise applicable to any Transferred Employees will be
         transferred to ALLTEL, Buyer, any Affiliates of Buyer, the Buyer
         Pension Plan, or any other employee plan, arrangement, program,
         practice or agreement of Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

         7.7    Welfare Plans.

         (a)    Buyer shall take all action necessary and appropriate to
ensure that, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date (or, in the case of
Transition Employees, the Transition Employee Conversion Date), Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer maintains or adopts, as of the Effective Time, one or more
Employee Welfare Benefit Plans, including medical, health, dental, flexible
spending account, accident, life, short-term disability, and long-term
disability and other Employee Welfare Benefit Plans for the benefit of the
Transferred Employees (the "Buyer Welfare Plans") which are at least as
favorable as the welfare benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Buyer.

         (b)    "Seamless" Transaction. The Buyer Welfare Plans shall provide
that each Transferred Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate in
and receive coverage under the Buyer Welfare Plans immediately after the Closing
Date (or, in the case of Transition Employees, the Transition Employee
Conversion Date). Any restrictions on coverage for pre-existing conditions or
requirements for evidence of insurability under the Buyer Welfare Plans shall be
waived for Transferred Employees to the extent that such restrictions have been
or would have been satisfied under the Seller Welfare Plan(s), and Transferred
Employees shall receive credit under each Buyer Welfare Plan for co-payments and
payments under a deductible limit made by them and for out-of-pocket maximums
and similar limits applicable to them during the plan year of the Seller Welfare
Plan in which the Closing occurs in accordance with the corresponding Employee
Welfare Benefit Plans maintained by Seller (the "Seller Welfare Plan(s)");
provided that Seller shall submit to the extent not restricted by any
Requirement of Law to Buyer within thirty (30) calendar days after the Closing
(or, in the case of Transition Employees, the Transition Employee Conversion
Date) a list of each Transferred Employees' copayment amounts, deductibles and
out-of-pocket maximums and indicating whether or not each has satisfied any
pre-existing condition limitation periods or evidence of insurability
requirements under the Seller Welfare Plans in order for Buyer to satisfy its
obligations under this Section.

         (c)    (i)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)(ii) below,
Buyer shall provide or cause to be provided retiree medical, health, and life
benefits to each Transferred Employee (or the dependents or beneficiaries of
such Transferred Employee, as the case may be) under substantially comparable
terms and conditions as apply to other comparable employees of Buyer and its
Affiliates, and Seller shall have no obligation to provide retiree medical,
health and life benefits in respect of any Transferred Employee on or after the
Closing Date (or, in the case of Transition Employees, the Transition Employee
Conversion Date).

                (ii)  Benefits provided pursuant to subsection (c)(i) above
         shall take into account service with and compensation increases from
         Buyer or its Affiliates after the Effective Time in the same manner as
         if such post-Effective Time service was performed with, or such
         compensation was provided by, Seller. Buyer shall provide Seller with
         such information as shall be reasonably required to implement the
         immediately preceding sentence.

         (d)    Nothing in this Section 7.7 shall require Seller, its
Affiliates or the Seller Welfare Plans to make any payment or to provide any
benefit not otherwise provided by the terms of the Seller Welfare Plans.

         (e)    Nothing in this Agreement shall require Seller or its
Affiliates to transfer assets or reserves with respect to the Seller Welfare
Plans to Buyer or its Affiliates or the Buyer Welfare Plans.

         7.8    Paid Time Off. Seller shall pay Transferred Employees the
balances as of the Closing Date (or, in the case of Transition Employees, the
Transition Employee Conversion Date) in their PTO accounts under Seller's
paid-time off policy. Transferred Employees shall be entitled to holidays, sick
leave, pro-rated floating holidays and pro-rated vacation time, for the year in
which the Closing (or, in the case of Transition Employees, the Transition
Employee Conversion Date) occurs, as determined under Buyer's policies in effect
as of the date of the Closing for similarly-situated employees of Buyer, taking
into account under such policies all service of Transferred Employees with
Seller and its Affiliates.

         7.9    Employee Rights.

         (a)    Nothing herein expressed or implied shall confer upon any
employee of Seller or its Affiliates, or Buyer or its Affiliates, or upon any
legal representative of such employee, or upon any collective bargaining agent
or group, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement.

         (b)    Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer upon any
Person (or any beneficiary thereof) any rights under or with respect to any
plan, arrangement, program, practice or agreement described in or contemplated
by this Agreement, and each Person (and any beneficiary thereof) shall be
entitled to rely only upon the express terms of any such plan, arrangement,
program, practice or agreement for his or her rights thereunder.

         (c)    Nothing in this Agreement shall cause Buyer or its Affiliates,
or Seller or its Affiliates, to have any obligation to provide employment or any
employee benefits to any individual who is not a Transferred Employee or, except
as otherwise provided in Section 7.2 with respect to Employment Agreements, to
continue to employ any Transferred Employee for any period of time following the
Closing Date.

         7.10   WARN Act Requirements. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall be responsible with respect to Transferred Employees and their
beneficiaries for compliance with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988 and any other applicable Requirements of Law, including
any requirement to provide for and discharge any and all notifications,
benefits, and Liabilities to Transferred Employees and Governmental Authorities
that might be imposed as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise.

         7.11   Communications with Employees. On or prior to the date hereof,
Seller and Buyer have agreed upon a form of joint announcement to employees
concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and a
communication plan concerning the method and timing of the delivery of such
announcement. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the parties will deliver such announcement to employees in accordance
with such communication plan. With respect to all other announcements to
employees, neither Buyer, Seller nor their respective Affiliates shall
distribute communications to Seller's employees concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without doing so in a form of writing that has
been approved in writing in advance by the counterparty hereto .

                                  ARTICLE 8
                                TAX COVENANTS

         8.1    Tax Sharing Agreements. Any Tax sharing agreement or policy
between any CenturyTel Entity and Seller or its Affiliates, or among any
CenturyTel Entities, shall be terminated as to any CenturyTel Entity as of the
Closing Date and will have no further effect as to any CenturyTel Entity for any
Taxable period after the Closing.

         8.2    Liability for Taxes, Filing Returns.

         (a)    Taxable Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. Seller
shall cause to be prepared and duly filed all Tax Returns required to be filed
by or with respect to each CenturyTel Entity for all Taxable years and periods
ending on or before the Closing Date. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all
Taxes due on such Tax Returns for all periods covered by such Tax Returns.
Seller will include, or cause to be included, the income of each CenturyTel
Entity (including any deferred income triggered into income by Treas. Reg.
Sections 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-14 and any excess loss accounts taken into income
under Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-19) on the consolidated federal and
consolidated, unitary or combined state and local income Tax Returns of Seller
and the Seller Group for all periods through the Closing Date. Each CenturyTel
Entity will furnish Tax information to Seller for inclusion in the consolidated
federal and consolidated, unitary or combined state and local income Tax Returns
for Seller and the Seller Group for the period ending on the Closing Date in
accordance with the past custom and practice of each CenturyTel Entity. At least
15 Business Days before filing any such Tax Return (other than Seller's
consolidated group returns), Seller shall submit to Buyer copies of such returns
for Buyer's review and comment. Seller will consider any such comments in good
faith. The income of each CenturyTel Entity will be apportioned to the period up
to and including the Closing Date and to the period after the Closing Date by
closing the books of each CenturyTel Entity as of the Effective Time.

         (b)    Taxable Periods Commencing After the Closing Date. Buyer shall
pay or cause to be paid all Taxes of the CenturyTel Entities for all Taxable
years and periods commencing after the Closing Date. Buyer shall cause to be
prepared and duly filed all Tax Returns of the CenturyTel Entities for Taxable
periods commencing after the Closing Date.

         (c)    Taxable Periods Commencing Before and Ending After the Closing
Date. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
any Tax Returns of each CenturyTel Entity for taxable periods that begin before
the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (the "Straddle Period"). At
least 15 Business Days before filing any such Tax Returns, Buyer shall submit
copies of such returns to Seller together with a calculation of the Taxes due
for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date in excess of
Taxes for such period which were reserved in the Closing Date Statement (other
than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) ("Seller Straddle Period Taxes") for Seller's
review and comment. Seller shall submit any such comments to Buyer no later than
five Business Days prior to the filing of any such Tax Returns. Buyer will
consider such comments in good faith. Buyer shall cause the CenturyTel Entities
to pay all Taxes due for or attributable to a Straddle Period. Upon notice from
Buyer, Seller shall pay to Buyer five (5) calendar days prior to the date any
payment for Taxes as described in this Section 8.2(c) is due, Seller's Straddle
Period Taxes. For purposes of this Section, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion
of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Taxable period ending on the
Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes not based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days in the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Taxable period, and (ii) in the case
of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the
amount which would be payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on the
Closing Date. Any credits relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into
account as though the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date.

         8.3    Audits. Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of the
progress of any audits of the consolidated federal and consolidated unitary or
combined income Tax Returns of Seller and the Seller Group to the extent that
such audits relate to such CenturyTel Entity and shall allow Buyer's reasonable
participation therein. Seller will allow each CenturyTel Entity to participate
at its expense in any audits of the consolidated federal and consolidated,
unitary or combined income Tax Returns of Seller and the Seller Group to the
extent that such audits relate to such CenturyTel Entity. Seller will not
settle, or cause to be settled, any such audit in a manner which would
materially adversely affect a CenturyTel Entity after the Closing Date unless
Seller obtains the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld.

         8.4    Cooperation on Tax Matters.

         (a)    Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns in accordance with
this Article and in connection with any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention, and (upon
the other party's request) the provision, of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Seller shall,
and Buyer shall cause the CenturyTel Entities to (i) retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to each CenturyTel Entity relating
to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any
extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing authority, and (ii) to
give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
shall reasonably allow the other party to take possession of such books and
records in such circumstances.

         (b)    Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request by the other party,
to use, or cause to be used, reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including without limitation, with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby).

         (c)    Buyer and Seller further agree, upon request by the other party,
to provide, or cause to be provided, to the other party all information that
either party may be required to report in accordance with Section 6043 of the
Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

         8.5    Defense of Tax Claim. In case any written claim, demand or
deficiency with respect to any Tax is asserted or any action is commenced or
written notice is given by any Taxing authority against any CenturyTel Entity or
Buyer, in respect to which indemnity may be sought against Seller in accordance
with Section 10.8 of this Agreement, Buyer shall give prompt written notice to
Seller. Seller shall promptly give written notice to Buyer of any written or
other notification received by Seller from a Taxing authority of a proposed
adjustment with respect to any Tax of any CenturyTel Entity which is
attributable to Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date and shall also
promptly give written notice to Buyer if a Taxing authority threatens to assert
against any CenturyTel Entity or Buyer the Tax Liability of any others
(including, but not limited to Seller). Seller shall have the right to control,
contest, resolve, settle and defend, and Buyer and the CenturyTel Entities shall
reasonably cooperate in, the portion of any claim, action or proceeding with
respect to any Tax for which Seller is responsible at the sole cost and expense
of Seller. Seller agrees to pay to Buyer and the CenturyTel Entities all of
their reasonable expenses which they shall incur in connection with such
cooperation. Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of the progress of any
such claim, action or proceeding and shall allow Buyer's reasonable
participation therein. Seller may not settle any such claim, action or
proceeding in a manner which would materially adversely affect a CenturyTel
Entity after the Closing Date unless Seller obtains the prior written consent of
Buyer, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld. Buyer may request that
Seller decline to take any further action with respect to any claim, demand or
deficiency described herein, and Seller thereafter shall take no action provided
that Buyer has notified Seller in writing that it waives its right to
indemnification for any Liability resulting therefrom and agrees to reimburse
Seller for any Loss incurred in connection therewith. In the event Seller
requests the CenturyTel Entities to pay Taxes to a Governmental Authority prior
to contesting the assessment thereof and thereafter to file a claim or suit for
refund, Seller shall advance to the CenturyTel Entities, on an interest-free
basis, the amount of any such payment, after which such entity shall promptly
pay the amount to the Governmental Authority as directed by Seller.

         8.6    Resolution of Disagreements Between Buyer and Seller. If Buyer
and Seller disagree as to the amount of Taxes for which each is liable under
this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall promptly consult each other in an effort
to resolve such dispute. If any such point of disagreement cannot be resolved
within 60 calendar days of the initial date of consultation, Buyer and Seller
shall within 10 calendar days after such 60-day period jointly select a
nationally recognized independent public accounting firm which has not, except
in accordance with this Agreement, performed any services since January 1, 1999
for either Seller or Buyer or their respective affiliated groups, to act as an
arbitrator to resolve, within 60 calendar days after their selection, all points
of disagreement concerning Tax matters with respect to this Agreement and
presented to such accounting firm at the time of its selection. If no nationally
recognized independent public accounting firm meets the aforementioned standard,
Buyer and Seller nonetheless shall attempt to agree on an accounting or law firm
that is satisfactory to both parties. If the parties cannot agree on the
selection of an accounting or law firm within such 10-day period, within five
Business Days after such 10-day period, the parties shall select an eligible
nationally recognized accounting firm by lot.

         8.7    Tax Elections. Except for elections described in Sections 8.10
and 8.12 and elections required by law or that Seller may make under Internal
Revenue Notice 2001-70 relating to mid-quarter convention rules for the year
ended December 31, 2001, no new elections with respect to Taxes or any changes
in current elections with respect to Taxes affecting Seller shall be made after
the date of this Agreement without the prior written consent of Buyer which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The CenturyTel Entities will forward
any material Tax elections affecting such entities to the Buyer prior to
Closing.

         8.8    Post-Closing Elections. At Seller's request, after the Closing
Date Buyer will cause the CenturyTel Entities to make or participate with Seller
in making any elections with respect to the Seller Group while they were
included in the Seller Group, which require the signature of all members of the
Seller Group during the tax year to which the election relates. At Seller's
request, Buyer will cause any CenturyTel Entity to make or join with Seller in
making any other election if the making of such election does not have a
material adverse impact on a CenturyTel Entity, Buyer or an Affiliate thereof
for any Tax period after the Closing Date.

         8.9    Transfer  Taxes.  Seller  shall pay any sales,  use,  transfer
and  documentary  taxes and  recording  and filing fees applicable to the
transfer of the Shares to Buyer at Closing.

         8.10   Section 754 Elections. At Buyer's request, Seller shall cause
each CenturyTel Entity which is treated as a partnership for Tax purposes to
make an election under Section 754 of the Code for Taxable periods of such
entity ending on or including the Closing Date.

         8.11   Allocation of Purchase Price. Within 60 days of the final
determination of the Purchase Price under Section 2.3, the parties agree that
the Purchase Price will be allocated among the CenturyTel Entities for all tax
purposes in accordance with Schedule 1.1(b) hereof. Buyer and Seller will file,
or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such
allocation unless otherwise required by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
all events, the Estimated Purchase Price as of the Closing Date will be
allocated 73.64 percent to the Section 338(h)(10) entities as set forth in
Schedule 8.12 and 26.36 percent to the other CenturyTel Entities. Any subsequent
Purchase Price adjustments will be allocated among the CenturyTel Entities in
the same proportion as their Agreed Value relates to the Base Purchase Price.

         8.12   Section 338(h)(10) Election.

         (a)    Each of Buyer and Seller agree that they will cause their
respective Affiliates to make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
(and any corresponding elections under state, local, or foreign Tax law) in
accordance with, and with respect to those CenturyTel Entities identified in,
Schedule 8.12 hereof as being the subject of a 338(h)(10) election
(collectively, a "Section 338(h)(10) Election").

         (b)    The computation of the "aggregate deemed sale price" and
"adjusted grossed up basis" (as defined in the applicable regulations issued
under the Code) (the "ADSP" and "AGUB", respectively) of the assets of each
entity shall be reasonable and prepared in accordance with Code Section 338.
Buyer and Seller shall agree on the allocation of the ADSP and AGUB among the
assets of each entity designated on Schedule 8.12 as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date (the "Allocation"). Buyer and Seller shall
execute and deliver to each other copies of the Allocation and shall prepare and
file such forms as may be required under the Code in a manner that is consistent
therewith.

         (c)    Seller and Buyer shall each provide to the other all necessary
information to permit the Section 338(h)(10) Election to be made. Buyer shall be
responsible for the preparation and filing of all forms or documents (including
without limitation IRS Form 8023) required to be filed with any Taxing authority
in connection with the Section 338(h)(10) Election (the "Section 338 Forms"). On
the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall execute IRS Form(s) 8023 and any forms
required to make any elections under state or local law that are analogous to a
Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller shall execute and deliver to Buyer any other
documents or forms as Buyer reasonably requires to complete properly the Section
338 Forms. Seller authorizes Buyer to file the Section 338 Forms and any other
forms referred to in the preceding sentence with the appropriate Taxing
authorities, and Buyer shall provide Seller with copies of such Section 338
Forms after such Section 338 Forms have been filed with the appropriate Taxing
authorities. Buyer and Seller shall prepare and file all Tax Returns on a basis
consistent with any Section 338(h)(10) Election (or, if such election is not
available under any state or local income Tax law, on a basis that is consistent
with the election available under such law that is analogous to an election
under Code Section 338(g)) and with an allocation of the ADSP and AGUB that is
consistent with the Allocation of ADSP and AGUB provided for in paragraph (b) of
this Section 8.12.

         (d)    Seller and Buyer shall calculate the gain or loss, if any,
resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election in a manner that is consistent
with the determination of ADSP and the Allocation and shall not take any
position inconsistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election, the ADSP or the
Allocation in connection with any Tax Return or otherwise unless otherwise
required by any Requirement of Law.

         8.13   Tax Carryovers. Buyer shall elect, where permitted by law, to
carry forward any Tax Attribute (as defined below) of each CenturyTel Entity
arising in any taxable period that begins on or after the Closing Date that,
absent such election, would be carried back to a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date.

         8.14   Refunds. Any refund of Taxes that is received by Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the CenturyTel Entities), and any amount credited against
Tax to which any of them become entitled, to the extent such Taxes or amount
credited relate to any Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and
to the extent that such Taxes or such amount credited have not been reflected in
the reserve or reserves for Tax liability shown on the Closing Date Statement
(rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and tax income), shall be for the account of Seller,
and Buyer and its Affiliates, as the case may be, shall pay over to Seller any
such refund or amount credited (net of Taxes, costs or expenses with respect
thereto) within 15 days after Buyer's or its Affiliates' receipt thereof or
entitlement thereto. In the event there is a final determination that Buyer or
its Affiliates were not entitled to any such amounts paid over to Seller, Seller
shall return such amounts within 15 days after Buyer's request therefor.

         8.15   Post-Closing Transactions not in the Ordinary Course;
Indemnification. Buyer and Seller agree to report all transactions not in the
ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date but after the time the
Stock Sale is consummated on Buyer's federal income tax return to the extent
permitted by Treas. Reg. ss.1.1502-76(b)(1)(B).

                                 ARTICLE 9
                              OTHER COVENANTS

         9.1    Confidentiality.

         (a)    Notwithstanding any provision in the Confidentiality Agreement
to the contrary, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect until October 24, 2003; provided, however, that (i) Buyer's covenants
regarding Evaluation Material (as defined therein) that relates to the
CenturyTel Entities, the Cellular Interests or the Business shall terminate and
be of no further force and effect as of the Closing Date, (ii) any covenants
restricting disclosure of the discussions or negotiations of the Stock Sale or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall terminate and be of no
further force and effect as of the date of this Agreement, (iii) any covenants
regarding the nonsolicitation of employees shall terminate and be of no further
force and effect as of the Closing Date and (iv) the last paragraph of such
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
as of the date of this Agreement.

         (b)    For a period of five years from and after the Closing Date,
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall use or take any action whatsoever
which would result in disclosure to any Third Party of any information about the
CenturyTel Entities, the Cellular Interests or the Business, provided that none
of such parties shall be required to maintain confidential any information which
(i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by Seller or any of its Affiliates; (ii) is obtained from a Third
Party, provided that such Third Party is not bound by a confidentiality
agreement with or other contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation of
confidentiality to any other Person with respect to such information or (iii) is
required to be disclosed by Seller or any of its Affiliates under any
Requirement of Law, provided that Buyer shall be given prompt written notice of
the request for such information and Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded the
information.

         9.2    Information Releases. The parties shall consult with each other
(and allow the other party notice, and a reasonable time and opportunity to
comment) in preparing any press release, public announcement, news media
response or other form of release of information concerning this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby that is intended to provide such
information to their employees generally, the news media or the public. Neither
party shall issue or cause the publication of any press release, public
announcement or media response without the prior written consent of the other
party; provided, however, that, after allowing the other party notice and a
reasonable time to comment prior to issuance, nothing herein will prohibit a
party from making an employee announcement, or issuing or causing publication of
any press release, public announcement or media response, to the extent that
such action is required by applicable Requirements of Law or the rules of any
national stock exchange applicable to such party or its Affiliates.

         9.3    Intellectual  Property.  Except as disclosed on  Schedule 3.17
and subject to the terms and conditions of the Transition Services Agreement,
the Seller is not retaining any Company Intellectual Property with respect to
the Business or the CenturyTel Entities.

         9.4    Insurance. In the event that any of the Assets (other than the
Excluded Assets) suffer any damage or destruction on or prior to the Closing
Date that is covered by insurance maintained by Seller or its Affiliates
("Damaged Assets"), Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliate to use reasonable
best efforts to collect any amounts due in respect of such Damaged Assets under
its insurance policies and, to the extent such proceeds have not been used to
replace such Damaged Assets at or prior to the Closing, Seller shall remit such
collected amounts to Buyer at the Closing. If Seller or its Affiliate receives
such proceeds after the Closing, Seller shall remit such proceeds to Buyer
promptly, but in any event no later than two (2) Business Days after the receipt
by Seller or its Affiliate. Seller or its Affiliates may, at their option,
terminate any or all insurance policies and programs applicable to the
CenturyTel Entities at any time on or after the Closing Date, provided that they
first provide written notice to Buyer describing the insurance to be cancelled
with particularity at least five Business Days prior to the termination date.

         9.5    Further Assurances. Seller and Buyer shall from time to time
after the Closing Date, at the request of the other party, use its reasonable
best efforts to execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be executed,
acknowledged and delivered, to such other party such other instruments of
conveyance and transfer and will take such other actions and execute and deliver
such other documents, certifications and further assurances as such other party
may reasonably require in order to vest more effectively in Buyer, or to put
Buyer more fully in possession of, the Shares or Control of any Cellular
Interests to be transferred to it in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto will cooperate with the other and execute
and deliver to the other party such other instruments and documents and take
such other actions as may be reasonably requested from time to time by such
other party as necessary to carry out, evidence and confirm the intended
purposes of this Agreement. Each of the parties will cause its respective
Affiliates to comply with this Section to the extent necessary or desirable to
fulfill the purposes thereof.

                             INDEMNIFICATION

         10.1   Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

         (a)    The representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing until one (1) year after the Closing Date; provided,
however, that:

                (i)   the representation and warranties contained in Sections
         3.1, 3.2(a), 3.3, 3.4(c) and (e), 3.6 (i) and (iii), 3.13, 3.15(b),
         3.16(b), 3.27 and 3.28 (the "Seller Transaction Representations"),
         4.1, 4.2, 4.3 (a) and (c), and 4.4 shall survive without limitation;

                (ii)  the representations and warranties of Seller contained in
         Section 3.11 shall survive the Closing until the expiration date of
         the applicable statute of limitations period;

                (iii) the representations and warranties of Seller contained in
         Section 3.14 shall survive until the expiration of three (3) years
         after the Closing Date; and

                (iv)  the representations and warranties of Seller contained
         in Section 3.18 shall survive until the expiration of four (4) years
         after the Closing Date.

         The covenants and agreements of the parties contained in or made in
accordance with the Agreement shall survive Closing in accordance with the terms
of such covenant or agreement and shall remain operative and in full force and
effect until the expiration date of the statute of limitations period applicable
to contractual obligations.

         (b)    This Article 10 shall survive the Closing and shall remain in
effect indefinitely. Any claim by a party based upon breach of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement made in accordance with Article 10
must be submitted to the breaching party prior to or at the expiration of the
applicable survival period specified in Section 10.1(a) or such claim may not be
pursued and is irrevocably waived. Notwithstanding any investigation or audit
conducted before or after the Closing Date or the decision of any party to
complete the Closing, each party shall be entitled to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty or on the performance of
or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right of
indemnification, or any other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants or obligations. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any
representation, warranty, covenant and agreement that is the subject of a Claim
asserted in writing prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period
set forth in Section 10.1(a) shall survive with respect to such Claim or any
dispute with respect thereto until the final resolution thereof. No written
assertion described in the preceding sentence will extend the survival of any
Claim unless the assertion describes the matters with sufficient particularity
to reasonably apprise the receiving party of the specific subject matter of such
Claim.

         10.2   Indemnification.

         (a)    Notwithstanding any investigation of the CenturyTel Entities,
the Cellular Interests, the Business or any Affiliate of the Company, and in
addition to the indemnification obligations of Seller set forth elsewhere
herein, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Buyer Indemnitee, against and in respect of any and all Losses
incurred or suffered by any Buyer Indemnitee that result from, relate to or
arise out of:

                (i)   any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
         warranty of Seller under this Agreement for the periods of time
         specified in Section 10.1(a)(i);

                (ii)  any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant
         of Seller under this Agreement;

                (iii) First Refusal Rights;

                (iv)  Retained Liabilities for the periods specified in
         Section 10.3(e);

                (v)   the Transferred Employee bonuses described in Section 7.4;

                (vi)  any and all matters disclosed on  Schedule 10.2(a) hereto
         including, without limitation, any brokerage fees set forth on such
         Schedule; and

                (vii) any and all actions, suits, claims, proceedings,
         investigations, demands, assessments, audits, fines, judgments, costs
         and other expenses incident to any of the foregoing or to the
         enforcement of this Section.

         (b)    In addition to the indemnification obligations of Buyer set
forth elsewhere herein, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each Seller Indemnitee, against and in respect of any
and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnitee that result from,
relate to or arise out of:

                (i)   any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
         warranty of Buyer under this Agreement;

                (ii)  any breach or nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant
         of Buyer under this Agreement;

                (iii) any and all matters disclosed on  Schedule 10.2(b) hereto
         including, without limitation, any brokerage fees set forth on such
         Schedule;

                (iv)  any and all actions, suits, claims, proceedings or
         investigations brought by any Third Party after the Effective Time
         that relate to the CenturyTel Entities, the Cellular Interests or the
         Business to the extent that the event giving rise thereto occurred
         after the Effective Time or which result from or arise out of any
         action or inaction after the Effective Time of Buyer or any of its
         Affiliates; and

                (v)   any and all actions, suits, claims, proceedings,
         investigations, demands, assessments, audits, fines, judgments, costs
         and other expenses incident to any of the foregoing or to the
         enforcement of this Section.

         10.3   Limitations on Claims for Losses. Following the Closing, claims
for Losses caused by or arising out of breach of warranty or representation
under Section 10.2(a)(i) or 10.2(b)(i) may be made only in accordance with
Article 10 hereof. Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding:

         (a)    Seller shall not be liable for any Losses with respect to any
breach of warranty or representation under Section 10.2(a)(i) (other than the
Seller Transaction Representations, for which the limitations of this Section
10.3 shall not apply) unless and until the total of all claims for indemnity or
damages with respect thereto exceeds $10,000,000 (the "Seller Deductible"), and
then the Seller shall be liable for all such claims (but only to the extent the
amounts of such claims exceed the Seller Deductible). The aggregate liability of
the Seller for breaches of representations and warranties under Section
10.2(a)(i) (other than the Seller Transaction Representations, for which the
limitations of this Section 10.3 shall not apply) shall not exceed $340,000,000.
For the purpose of clarification, the limitations of liability contained in this
Section 10.3(a) shall apply only to the provisions of Section 10.2(a)(i)
specifically described herein and shall not apply to any other claims for Losses
under Section 10.2(a) including, without limitation, those related to Seller
Transaction Representations and Retained Liabilities.

         (b)    In the event any matter covered by Section 10.2 relates to
Taxes and is also covered by Section 10.8 or Article 8, the provisions of
Article 8 and Section 10.8 shall control.

         (c)    In no event shall either party hereto be liable for indirect,
special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages resulting from, relating
to or arising out of a breach of or claim for indemnification under this
Agreement, even if advised at the time of breach of the possibility of such
damages, except to the extent such damages are the subject of a Third Party
Claim for which indemnification is available under this Agreement.

         (d)    If, after a party or its Affiliates receive any indemnification
payment hereunder, the amount of such party's Loss to which such payment relates
is reduced by recovery, settlement or otherwise under any insurance coverage (or
other source of indemnity or reimbursement), or pursuant to any claim, recovery,
settlement or payment by or against any Third Party, the amount of such
reduction (less any costs, expenses, or Taxes incurred in connection therewith)
will promptly be repaid by the party receiving such amount to the other party.

         (e)    No Claim may be made by Buyer with respect to a Retained
Liability in accordance with Section 10.2(a)(iv) after the fifth year
anniversary of the Closing Date, but any Retained Liability that is the subject
of a Claim asserted in writing prior to the expiration of such anniversary date
shall survive with respect to such Claim or any dispute with respect thereto
until the final resolution thereof. No written assertion described in the
preceding sentence will extend the survival of any Claim unless the assertion
describes the matters with sufficient particularity to reasonably apprise the
receiving party of the specific subject matter of such Claim.

         10.4   Indemnification Procedure as to Third-Party Claims.

         (a)    Promptly after a Buyer Indemnitee or a Seller Indemnitee
(individually, an "Indemnitee") obtains knowledge of the commencement of any
claim, action, suit or proceeding by a Third Party or of the occurrence of any
event or the existence of any state of facts which may become the basis of a
claim by a Third Party (any such claim, action, suit or proceeding or event or
state of facts being hereinafter referred to in this Section 10.4 as a "Claim"),
in respect of which an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, such Indemnitee shall promptly notify the indemnitor under this
Agreement (the "Indemnitor") of such Claim in writing setting forth in
reasonable detail the specific facts and circumstances relating to such Claim
and the amount of Losses subject to the Claim (or an estimate thereof if the
actual amount is not known or not capable of reasonable calculation); provided,
however, that any failure to give such notice will not waive any rights of the
Indemnitee except to the extent that the rights of the Indemnitor are actually
and materially prejudiced thereby. No written assertion described in the
preceding sentence will extend the survival of any Claim unless the assertion
describes the matters with sufficient particularity to reasonably apprise the
receiving party of the specific subject matter of such Claim. With respect to
any Claim as to which such notice is given by the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor,
the Indemnitor shall, subject to the provisions of Section 10.4(b) below, be
entitled to participate in and, if it desires, to assume the defense and
settlement of such Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee
at the Indemnitor's sole risk and expense; provided, however, that the
Indemnitee (i) shall be permitted to join in the defense and settlement of such
Claim and to employ counsel at its own expense, (ii) shall reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnitor in the defense and any settlement of such Claim in any
manner reasonably requested by the Indemnitor and (iii) shall have the
unilateral right to pay or settle such Claim at any time in which event the
Indemnitee shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnification therefor
by the Indemnitor. Following written notice from the Indemnitor to the
Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Claim in accordance with
this Section 10.4(a), the Indemnitor will not be liable to the Indemnitee for
any other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with
the defense of the Claim, other than costs and expenses of the Indemnitee
incurred at the written request of the Indemnitor or incurred in accordance with
Section 10.4(b). The assumption of the defense of any Claim by the Indemnitor
will not be deemed to be an admission by the Indemnitor of liability for such
Claim.

         (b)    If the Indemnitor fails to assume the defense of such Claim or,
having assumed the defense and settlement of such Claim, fails reasonably to
contest such Claim in good faith, the Indemnitee, without waiving its right to
indemnification, may notify Indemnitor of Indemnitee's desire to assume the
defense and settlement of such Claim, and in the event such notice concerns the
failure of the Indemnitor to reasonably contest a Claim following an assumption
of such defense, if Indemnitor fails to re-assume the defense of such Claim and
commence to reasonably contest such Claim in good faith within 15 days after
such notice, Indemnitee may assume the defense and settlement of such Claim;
provided, however, that (i) the Indemnitor shall be permitted to join in the
defense and settlement of such Claim and to employ counsel at its own expense,
(ii) the Indemnitor shall cooperate with the Indemnitee in the defense and
settlement of such Claim in any manner reasonably requested by the Indemnitee,
(iii) the Indemnitor shall not be liable for the fees and disbursements of more
than one counsel for all Indemnitees in connection with any one proceeding or
any similar or related proceedings arising from the same general allegations or
circumstances and (iv) the Indemnitee shall not settle such Claim without
soliciting the views of the Indemnitor and giving them due consideration.

         (c)    If the remedy sought by the claimant with respect to such
Claim is not solely for money damages, and would affect the operation of the
Business after the Closing, the Indemnitor shall not settle such Claim without
the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. If Buyer provides the Indemnitor with written consent, Buyer agrees to
be bound by the settlement of a Claim.

         (d)    As used in this Section 10.4, the term Indemnitee shall be
deemed to include the plural thereof where the rights or obligations of more
than one Indemnitee may be involved.

         10.5   Adjustment For Insurance and Tax Benefits. Any indemnification
payable in accordance with Section 10.2 shall be net of any amounts actually
recovered (after deducting related costs and expenses) by the Indemnitee for the
Losses for which such indemnification payment is made, under any insurance
policy, warranty or indemnity from any Third Party existing at the Closing Date,
provided that no Indemnitee shall be obligated to seek any recovery under any
such insurance policy, warranty, indemnity or any Tax benefits actually realized
and recognized by the Indemnitee in respect of any Losses for which
indemnification is made.

         10.6   Payment.

         (a)    Upon a determination of liability in respect of Article 10 of
this Agreement, the appropriate party shall pay the Indemnitee the amount so
determined (subject to the limitations of Section 10.3) within 10 Business Days
after the date of determination (such tenth Business Day, the "Due Date"). If
there should be a dispute as to the amount or manner of determination of any
indemnity obligation owed under this Agreement, the Indemnitor shall
nevertheless pay when due such portion, if any, of the obligation as shall not
be subject to dispute. The difference, if any, between the amount of the
obligation ultimately determined as properly payable under this Agreement and
the portion, if any, theretofore paid shall bear interest as provided below in
Section 10.6(b). Upon the payment in full of any claim, either by setoff or
otherwise, the Indemnitor or other Person making payment shall be subrogated to
the rights of the Indemnitee against any Person with respect to the subject
matter of such claim.

         (b)    If all or part of any indemnification obligation under this
Agreement is not paid when due, then the Indemnitor shall pay the Indemnitee
interest on the unpaid amount of the obligation for each calendar day from the
Due Date until payment in full, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to
the Applicable Rate on the Due Date.

         10.7   Other Rights and Remedies. Following the Closing, the sole
and exclusive remedy at law (other than with respect to claims involving fraud)
for Seller or Buyer for any claim (whether such claim is framed in tort,
contract or otherwise) arising out of a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement in this Agreement shall be a claim by Seller or
Buyer for indemnification in accordance with this Article 10, which claims are
independent of and in addition to any equitable rights or remedies.

         10.8   Tax Indemnification.

         (a)    Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees from and against (i) any Liability for Taxes of the CenturyTel
Entities due in respect of all Taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date and the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (other
than Taxes specifically reserved on the Closing Date Statement, but excluding
any reserve for deferred Taxes to reflect timing differences between book and
Tax income), (ii) any liability that may be imposed on the CenturyTel Entities
in accordance with Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under the Code or in accordance with any analogous provision of state or local
law, as a result of the affiliation of the CenturyTel Entities with Seller or an
Affiliate of Seller or predecessor-in-interest, and (iii) any liability for
Taxes resulting from Section 338(h)(10) Elections with respect to the CenturyTel
Entities or Cellular Entities.

         (b)    Seller also agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Buyer Indemnitees from and against any and all costs sustained in a Tax period
of a CenturyTel Entity ending after the Closing Date arising out of the
settlement or other resolution (without the written consent of Buyer) of a
proposed Tax adjustment which relates to a Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date. For example, if Seller agrees in an income Tax audit to reduce the
depreciable basis of property acquired by a CenturyTel Entity before the Closing
Date, Seller shall be liable for any additional Taxes due from such CenturyTel
Entity by reason of reduced depreciation deductions.

         (c)    In the case of any representation, warranty and agreement of
Seller in Section 3.11 and any other representation or warranty relating to or
affecting the CenturyTel Entities' Liability for Taxes, whether the entity's own
Taxes or its liability, if any (for example, by reason of transferee liability
or application of Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6) for the Taxes of others
including, but not limited to Seller or any former or present Affiliate or
Subsidiary thereof, the same shall survive until the later of the final
resolution of any judicial or administrative proceeding involving any such Tax
or expiration of any statute of limitations (including any suspensions, tollings
or extensions thereof.)

         10.9   Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Seller and Buyer agree that
any indemnity payments in accordance with this Article 10 will be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Buyer shall not be indemnified or reimbursed for any
Tax consequences arising from the receipt or accrual of an indemnity payment
hereunder, including any Tax consequences arising from adjustments to the basis
of any asset resulting from an adjustment to the Purchase Price or any
additional or reduced Taxes resulting from any such basis adjustment.

                                ARTICLE 11
                               TERMINATION

         11.1   Termination. Anything herein or elsewhere to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Closing
Date only as follows:

         (a)    by mutual consent in writing of Seller and Buyer;

         (b)    by Buyer upon written notice given to Seller, if Seller
commits a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement that has resulted or is
reasonably likely to result in the failure of any condition to Closing under
Article 6 of this Agreement to be satisfied, and such breach is not curable or,
if curable, is not cured within 30 calendar days after written notice of such
breach;

         (c)    by Seller upon written notice given to Buyer, if Buyer commits
a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement that has resulted or is
reasonably likely to result in the failure of any condition to Closing under
Article 6 of this Agreement to be satisfied, and such breach is not curable or,
if curable, is not cured within 30 calendar days after written notice of such
breach; (d) by Buyer or Seller upon written notice given to the other if the
Closing shall not have taken place on or before 11:59 p.m. Central time on
September 30, 2002;

         (e)    by Buyer upon written notice given to the Seller if any
Governmental Authority (i) shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken
any other action that permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the
Stock Sale and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become a Final Order or (ii) shall
have failed to issue an order, decree or ruling or to take any other action, as
applicable, and such denial of a request to issue such order, decree, ruling or
take such other action shall have become a Final Order, in the case of each of
(i) and (ii) which is necessary to fulfill the conditions set forth in Article
6; and

         (f)    by Buyer upon written notice given to the Seller at any time
after (i) the occurrence of a First Refusal Exercise Event or (ii) all
conditions precedent set forth in Article 6 (other any condition precedent that
is not capable of being satisfied until the Closing) have been satisfied or
waived other than the condition set forth in Section 6.1(e)(i) due to the
failure of Seller to obtain a Material Acknowledgment in accordance with Section
5.19.

         11.2   Limitation on Right of Termination. No party shall be entitled
to exercise any right of termination in accordance with Section 11.1(d) or (e)
if the events described therein have been caused by or resulted from such
party's failure to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement or the
Transition Services Agreement.

         11.3   Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 11.1, this Agreement shall become wholly void
and of no further force and effect, except that the provisions of this Section
11.3, and Sections 1.2, 5.5(e), 5.14(f), 5.19(d), 9.1(a), 10.3(c), and Article
12 shall survive any termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no termination
shall relieve any party from Liability for any breach by that party of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies
at law or in equity with respect to any such breach.

performance, or extend the time for performance, of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies of the other party in
its representations and warranties, or (iii) waive compliance with any
conditions precedent specified in Article 6 to its obligations to consummate the
Stock Sale or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that neither party may grant any waiver, the effect of which would be
unlawful. No waiver of any term or provision of this Agreement shall be
effective unless in writing, signed by the party against whom enforcement of the
same is sought. The grant of a waiver in one instance does not constitute a
continuing waiver in all similar instances. No failure of a party to exercise,
and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof.

         12.8   Third Parties. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement are for the sole benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal
representatives, successors and assigns and, in the case of Article 10, the
Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees, and they shall not be construed as
conferring any rights or remedies on any other Persons.

         12.9   Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and any party hereto may execute any such counterpart, each of
which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all of
which counterparts taken together shall constitute but one and the same
instrument.

         12.10  Governing Law. Except as provided in Section 2.3(c) regarding
the application of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to such state's
laws and principles regarding the conflict of laws. Each of the parties hereto
(a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Federal court
located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in connection with
any dispute that arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any
such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in any court
other than a Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware or a Delaware state
court unless venue would not be proper under rules applicable in such courts.
The parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waive trial by jury in any
legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby, and for any counterclaim with respect thereto.
In the event of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement, the
non-breaching party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including in the form
of injunctions and orders for specific performance, where the applicable legal
standards for such relief in such courts are met, in addition to all other
remedies available to the non-breaching party with respect thereto at law or in
equity.

         12.11  Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
determined to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
without invalidating or rendering unenforceable the remaining provisions hereof,
and such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provisions in any other
jurisdiction.

         12.12  Specific Performance. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
10.7, the parties acknowledge that their obligations hereunder are unique and
that, prior to Closing, remedies at law, including monetary damages, will be
inadequate in the event either party should default in the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event of any such breach
prior to Closing, the non-defaulting party shall be entitled to a decree of
specific performance pursuant to which the defaulting party is ordered to
affirmatively carry out its pre-closing obligations under this Agreement. The
foregoing shall not be deemed to be or construed as a waiver or election of
remedies by either party, both of whom expressly reserve any and all rights and
remedies available to it at law or in equity in the event of any breach or
default by the other party under this Agreement prior to Closing.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this
Agreement on the date first written above.
