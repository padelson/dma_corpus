Partnership immediately after the Effective Time shall be the Surviving
Entity, and the limited partners of the Operating Partnership immediately
after the Effective Time shall be those Existing Unit Holders that elect not

Election Form to the Company.     11     ARTICLE III   EFFECTS OF
THE MERGER   Section 3.01 Effects on Shares. As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any of their respective stockholders:   (a) Each common
share of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and be
unaffected by the Merger.   (b) Each Company Common Share that is owned by
any Subsidiary or by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made
with respect thereto.   (c) Each Company Common Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including each
restricted share (a "Restricted Share") granted under the Company\'s 2004
Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan") or otherwise, but other than
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.01(b)) shall automatically
be converted into, and canceled in exchange for, the right to receive an
amount equal to the sum of (i) $13.35 (the "Company Common Share Cash Merger
Consideration"), and (ii) to the extent the Company\'s regular dividend with
respect to the fiscal quarter in which the Effective Time occurs has not
previously been declared and paid, an amount in cash equal to $0.175
multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the number of days
between the last day of the last fiscal quarter for which full quarterly
dividends on the Company Common Shares have been declared and paid and the
Effective Time (including the date on which the Effective Time occurs) by (y)
the total number of days in the fiscal quarter during which the Effective
Time occurs, without interest (the "Additional Company Common Share Merger
Consideration" and, together with the Company Common Share Cash Merger
Consideration, the "Company Common Share Merger Consideration").   (d) Each
share of the Company\'s 8.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Shares, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Series A Preferred Shares"),
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the
Surviving Entity\'s 8.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares,
par value $0.01 per share having the rights and preferences set forth in
Exhibit B hereto (the "Surviving Entity Series A Preferred Shares" and
the consideration issued in exchange for the Company Series A Preferred
Shares, the "Preferred Share Merger Consideration").   (e) By virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of Restricted Shares granted pursuant to the Incentive Plan or
otherwise, all Restricted Shares automatically shall become fully vested and
free of any forfeiture restriction immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and shall be considered Company Common Shares for all purposes of this
Agreement, including receipt of the Company Common     12    Share
Merger Consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt
such resolutions and will take such other actions, including adopting any
plan amendments and obtaining any required consents, as shall be required to
effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 3.01(e).   (f) If,
subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding Company Common Shares or Company Series A Preferred Shares shall
have been changed into a different number of shares as a result of a stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
split, combination, exchange, recapitalization, or any dividend or other
distribution payable in stock or other securities is declared thereon or
rights issued in respect thereof with a record date within such period, or
other similar transaction, the Company Common Share Merger Consideration or
the Preferred Share Merger Consideration, as applicable, shall be
appropriately adjusted so that the aggregate amount payable pursuant to this
Agreement to effect the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions shall not
have increased or decreased as a result of such adjustment.   Section 3.02
Effect on Units of Partnership Interest of the Operating Partnership.   (a)
In connection with the Merger and in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this Section 3.02, Parent and Merger Sub shall offer (the "Operating
Partnership Offer") to each holder (each an "Existing Unit Holder") of units
of limited partnership interest (the "Existing Units") of the Operating
Partnership the opportunity to receive in cash, in exchange for each issued
and outstanding Existing Unit held by such holder, an amount equal to the sum
of (i) $13.35 and (ii) to the extent the Company\'s regular dividend with
respect to the fiscal quarter in which the Effective Time occurs has not
previously been declared and paid, an amount in cash equal to
$0.175 multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the number of days
between the last day of the fiscal quarter for which full quarterly dividends
on the Company Common Shares have been declared and paid and the Effective
Time (including the date on which the Effective Time occurs) by (y) the
total number of days in the fiscal quarter in which the Effective Time
occurs, without interest (the "Electing Unit Consideration") as long as the
Company receives an Election Form from such holder (an "Electing Unit
Holder") in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.02. Any Existing
Unit Holder who elects not to accept the Operating Partnership Offer or does
not timely and properly return an Election Form as set forth in this Section
3.02 (a "Remaining Unit Holder"), shall remain as a limited partner of the
Operating Partnership and continue to hold Existing Units with the rights,
terms and conditions set forth in the Operating Partnership Agreement, and
shall not be entitled to receive the Electing Unit Consideration. The term
"Existing Unit" shall not include those units of partnership interest issued
by the Operating Partnership to the Company in consideration of the
contribution by the Company to the Operating Partnership of the entire net
proceeds received by the Company from the issuance of the Company Series A
Preferred Shares (such units, "Series A Preferred Partnership Units").  
(b) The Company shall prepare a form of election in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent (the "Election Form"), describing the
Operating Partnership Offer and pursuant to which each Existing Unit Holder
will have the right to specify the number, if any, of Existing Units which it
desires to have exchanged for the right to receive an amount equal to the
Electing Unit Consideration. In order for an Existing Unit Holder to be
eligible to     13     elect to have its Existing Units redeemed
pursuant to the Operating Partnership Offer, such Existing Unit Holder shall
have submitted an Election Form in accordance with the procedures and time
periods specified in this Section 3.02 and as shall be described more fully
in the Election Form.   (c) The Company shall mail or cause to be mailed
an Election Form to each Existing Unit Holder, together with any other
materials that the Company and Parent determine to be necessary or prudent,
no later than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. An
election to receive the Electing Unit Consideration in the Operating
Partnership Offer shall be effective only if a properly executed Election
Form is received by the Company or its designees prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern
Time on the Business Day prior to the Closing Date, or such other date as the
Company and Parent shall agree. If an Existing Unit Holder fails to return a
duly completed Election Form within the time period specified in the Election
Form, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to remain as a limited
partner of the Operating Partnership and continue to hold Existing Units.
Parent and the Company agree that (i) the Existing Unit Holders shall have
the right to revoke any election made in connection with the Operating
Partnership Offer at any time prior to the expiration of the time period
stated in the Election Form, and (ii) the Operating Partnership Offer shall
be conducted in accordance with applicable Law and the Operating Partnership
Agreement. Parent and the Company, by mutual agreement, shall have the right
to make rules, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing
the validity of Election Forms and the issuance and delivery of the Electing
Unit Consideration, as applicable.   (d) Prior to the Closing Date, the
Operating Partnership shall declare a distribution with respect to each
Existing Unit that is not an Electing Unit in an amount equal to the
Additional Company Common Share Merger Consideration, the record date for
such distribution to be the close of business on the date of the Effective
Time or such other date as the Company, as general partner of the Operating
Partnership, and Parent shall agree. Such distribution shall be paid as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event within
five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time).   (e) Whenever any event
occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Election Form, (i) Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly
inform the other of such occurrence, and (ii) Parent and the Company shall,
in cooperation with each other, prepare any such amendment or supplement to
the Election Form, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
the indication of such satisfaction not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.  (f) The obligation of the Company and Parent to consummate the
Operating Partnership Offer shall be conditioned upon, and shall be subject
to, the concurrent Closing of the Merger as provided in this Agreement.  
Section 3.03 Paying Agent.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act
as Paying Agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment in accordance with this
Article III of the Company Common Share Merger     
14   Consideration and the Electing Unit Consideration (collectively, such
cash being referred to as the "Payment Fund"). On or before the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent the Company Common Share
Merger Consideration and the Electing Unit Consideration, for the benefit of
the holders of Company Common Shares and Electing Units, respectively. The
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make, and the Paying Agent shall
make, payments of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration and the
Electing Unit Consideration out of the Payment Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and
all interest earned on cash deposited in the Payment Fund shall be paid to
the Surviving Entity.   (b) At the Effective Time, the share transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Company Common Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, persons who held Company Common Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates of the Company presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving
Entity or the transfer agent for any reason shall be exchanged for the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Company Common
Shares formerly represented thereby.   (c) Promptly after the Effective
Time (but in any event within two (2) Business Days after the Effective
Time), the Surviving Entity shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
person who immediately prior to the Effective Time held of record Company
Common Shares: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the holder\'s Certificates
in exchange for the Company Common Share Merger Consideration to which the
holder thereof is entitled. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory
to the Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company
Common Shares previously represented by such Certificate pursuant to the
provisions of this Article III, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
3.03, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Company
Common Share Merger Consideration, as contemplated by this Section 3.03. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration.     15     (d) As of the Effective Time, holders of
Company Common Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Company
Common Share Merger Consideration provided under this Article III. The
Company Common Share Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates representing Company Common Shares, in accordance
with the terms of this Article III, shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the Company Common
Shares exchanged therefor and represented by such Certificates. As of the
Effective Time, the holders of Existing Units for which a properly executed
Election Form is timely received (an "Electing Unit") shall cease to be, and
shall have no rights as, limited partners of the Operating Partnership other
than the right to receive the Electing Unit Consideration provided under this
Article III.   (e) Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares or Electing
Units for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
the Surviving Entity and any holders of Company Common Shares and Electing
Units prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this Article
III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration and the Electing Unit
Consideration, as applicable.   (f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Entity, the Company, the Operating Partnership or the Paying Agent,
or any employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate thereof, shall be
liable to any person in respect of the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration or the Electing Unit Consideration, as applicable, if the
Payment Fund has been delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   (g) The Paying
Agent shall invest the cash included in the Payment Fund, as directed by the
Surviving Entity, on a daily basis. Any net profit resulting from, or
interest or income produced by, such investments shall be placed in the
Payment Fund. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt payments of the Company Common Share Merger
Consideration or the Electing Unit Consideration as contemplated hereby,
Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund lost
through investments or other events so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is,
at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.   (h)
If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Entity or the
Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the
Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent reasonably may direct, the Paying Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Company Common Share Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.   (i) Certificates representing Company Series A
Preferred Shares prior to the Effective Time shall represent Surviving Entity
Series A Preferred Shares after the Effective Time.     16    
Section 3.04 Withholding Rights. The Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Shares or Electing Units such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, as applicable, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of Company Common Shares or Electing Units in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Entity or the
Paying Agent, as applicable.   Section 3.05 Further Actions. If at any time
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall consider or be advised
that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or
things are necessary, desirable or proper (i) to vest, perfect or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in the Surviving Entity its right, title or interest in,
to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or
assets of any of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Operating Partnership or
Merger Sub or (ii) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the Surviving Entity and its proper officers and directors or its designees
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
the Company, its Subsidiaries, Merger Sub and the Operating Partnership, all
such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and do, in the name and
on behalf of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Merger Sub and the
Operating Partnership all such other acts and things necessary, desirable or
proper to vest, perfect or confirm its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets
of any of the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Operating Partnership or Merger
Sub, as applicable, and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.     ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP   Except as set forth in the
Company\'s SEC Reports or in the Disclosure Schedule, the Company and the
Operating Partnership hereby represent and warrant to Parent Parties as

Subsidiaries; Authority.   (a) Each of the Company and the Operating
Partnership is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization or formation and has the
requisite corporate, limited partnership or similar power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing
and in good standing or to have such corporate, limited partnership, limited
liability company or similar power and authority, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company\'s other Subsidiaries is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization or formation and has the requisite
corporate, limited partnership, limited liability     17    company

not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries are duly qualified or licensed to do
business and in good standing (to the extent applicable), in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of their business or the ownership or
leasing of their properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for such failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good

Partnership other than the Company, or as set forth in Section 4.03(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule, there are no existing options, warrants, calls,
subscription rights, convertible securities or other rights, agreements or

REIT subsidiary" or any subsidiary of a "taxable REIT subsidiary") has
engaged at any time in any "prohibited transactions" within the meaning of
Section 857(b)(6) of the Code. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has engaged in any transaction that

interest" described in section 857(b)(7) of the Code.   (g) All material
deficiencies asserted or assessments made with respect to the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company as a result of any examinations by the IRS or any

contested in good faith. There are no audits, examinations or other

date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company, no claim has been made in
writing by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company does not file Tax Returns that the Company or any
such Subsidiary of the Company is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction.   (j) Neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf
of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has requested any extension
of time within which to file any material Tax Return, which material Tax
Return has not yet been filed.   (k) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
of the Company is a party to any Tax sharing or similar agreement or
arrangement other than any agreement or arrangement solely between the
Company and any Subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which it will have any
obligation to make any payments after the Closing.  (l) Neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary of the Company has requested a private letter ruling from
the IRS or comparable rulings from other taxing authorities.   (m) There

hereof) with the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement, and each of the Company
and Parent shall, or shall cause their respective affiliates to, prepare and

comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings,
and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the

shall notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings and shall provide Parent with
copies of all correspondence between the Company and its representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to the
Proxy Statement or the Other Filings. If at any time prior to the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors,
shall be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings, so that
the Proxy Statement or the Other Filings shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement or filing the Other Filings (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response and, to the extent practicable, the
Company will provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in any
substantive calls between the Company or any of its Representatives and the
SEC concerning the Proxy Statement.   Section 7.02 Company Stockholders\'
Meeting. The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Charter and Company Bylaws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders\' Meeting"), as
promptly as practicable after the date that the Proxy Statement is cleared by
the SEC (and shall use commercially reasonable efforts such that the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting shall initially be set on a date no more than 50 days
after the Proxy Statement is so cleared), for the purpose of voting upon the
approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the     44    Contemplated
Transactions (the "Company Stockholder Approval"). Except in accordance with

7.04(c), the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from
its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement, the
Merger and the Contemplated Transactions and will take all other action
reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its
stockholders required by the rules of the NYSE or applicable
Legal Requirements to obtain such approval. The Company shall keep the
Parent Parties updated with respect to proxy solicitation results as
reasonably requested by Parent.   Section 7.03 Access to Information;

confidentiality agreements, from the date hereof until the Effective Time,
promptly following notice from Parent to the Company, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, auditors
and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, afford Parent reasonable
access during normal business hours to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books and records of the
Company and each Subsidiary of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither Parent nor any of its representatives shall (i) contact or have any

employees, agents, or representatives, unless in each case Parent obtains the
prior written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, (ii) contact or have any discussions with
any of the property managers, landlords/sublandlords, tenants/subtenants, or

representatives cause in the course of or result directly or indirectly from
any inspection, procedure or investigation that Parent or its representatives
perform pursuant hereto. Subject to the foregoing, Parent shall schedule and
coordinate all inspections with the Company and shall give the Company at
least three (3) Business Days prior written notice thereof, setting forth the
inspection or materials that Parent or its representatives intend to conduct.
The Company shall be entitled to have representatives present at all times
during any such inspection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the Company or its Subsidiaries or contravene
any Law or binding agreement. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to request each company which manages any Company Property to provide
information to the Parent Parties concerning such properties, the management
thereof and all other matters related thereto.     45     (b) All
information obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section 7.03 and pursuant to
the confidentiality agreement, dated February 27, 2007 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), between Parent and the Company, shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.   (c) No investigation
pursuant to this Section 7.03 or otherwise shall affect any representation or
warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the
obligations of the parties hereto.  Section 7.04 No Solicitation of
Transactions.   (a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, directly or
indirectly, and shall instruct their respective officers,
directors, financial advisors, attorneys and agents ("Company

encourage, induce or facilitate any inquiries regarding, or the making,
submission, reaffirmation or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal or take
any action that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) furnish any nonpublic information regarding any of the Company

the Company Parties, to any Person in connection with or in response to an
Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or indication of interest that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) engage in,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
Person in respect of, or otherwise cooperate with respect to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (v)
enter into any letter of intent, arrangement, understanding, agreement,
agreement in principle or similar document or any Contract contemplating or
otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 7.04(a) by any Company Representative (other than any director
of the Company whose Affiliate is, as of the date hereof, a party to a
confidentiality agreement with the Company containing terms (including
"standstill provisions") materially consistent with the Confidentiality
Agreement), whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of any
of the Company Parties or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 7.04(a) by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from the date
hereof and prior to the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the
Contemplated Transactions by the Required Vote, nothing in this Agreement
(including this Section 7.04(a)) shall, subject to Section 7.04(b), prohibit
the Company from furnishing any information regarding the Company Parties to,
or entering into or conducting discussions or negotiations with, any Person
in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that is submitted to
the Company by such Person during such period (and not withdrawn) if (A)
neither the Company nor any Company Representative shall have breached or
violated this Section 7.04(a) in any respect that results in such Acquisition
Proposal, (B) the Company Board or its Special Committee concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Company\'s or the Special Committee\'s
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the duties of the members of the Company Board under applicable Legal
Requirements, (C) the Company Board or its Special Committee concludes in
good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel and financial advisor,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to
a Superior Proposal and (D) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
information to such Person, the Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms (including
"standstill provisions") materially     46    consistent with the
Confidentiality Agreement. As promptly as reasonably practicable following
the furnishing of information pursuant to this Section 7.04(a), the Company
shall provide to Parent any information concerning any of the Company Parties
that is furnished to any third Person or its Representatives which was not
previously provided to Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the provisions of any standstill agreement to which the
Company is a party are hereby waived to permit any actions by the parties
thereto permitted by the terms of this Section 7.04.   (b) From and after
the execution of this Agreement, except to the extent that doing so would
result in a breach of the duties of the directors of the Company, each of the
Company Parties shall promptly, and in any event within forty-eight (48)
hours following the initial receipt by it of any Acquisition Proposal, any
indication by any Person considering making an Acquisition Proposal, any
request for information relating to any of the Company Parties (other than
requests for information in the ordinary course of business and unrelated to
an Acquisition Proposal) or any inquiry or request for discussions or
negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal which any of the Company
Parties or any of their respective Company Representatives may receive after
the date hereof, advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) the receipt,
directly or indirectly, of any such inquiries, negotiations or proposals
relating to any Acquisition Proposal by the Company, (ii) the material terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request,
together with a copy thereof (if available) or if not in writing, a written
description thereof, (iii) the identity of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal and (iv) the Company\'s intention to furnish information to, or
enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person. The Company shall
keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis as to any material
developments regarding any such Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or
request. None of the Company Parties shall, after the date hereof, enter into
any confidentiality agreement that would prohibit them from providing such
information to Parent.   (c) The Company Board and the Special Committee may
not (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to the Parent
Parties, or fail to make, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve,
authorize or recommend, or propose publicly or approve, authorize or
recommend, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) authorize or permit the Company to
enter into any agreement (an "Acquisition Agreement") contemplating an
Acquisition Proposal (other than the confidentiality agreement referred to
above) or (iv) permit the Company Parties to take any action to exempt or
make not subject to any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price,"
"affiliate transaction," "business combination" or other anti-takeover Legal
Requirements or any "excess share" or similar ownership limitation provisions
(including the Ownership Limitation) applicable to the Company, any Person
(other than the Parent Parties and their respective Affiliates) or any action
taken by any such Person, which Person or action would have otherwise have
been subject to the restrictive provisions thereof and/or not exempt
therefrom. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time prior
to the earlier of the Required Vote and the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article IX, the Company Board or its Special Committee may take
one or more of the actions described in the preceding clauses (i) - (iv) in
response to a Superior Proposal if the Company Board or its Special Committee
concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s (or the
Special Committee\'s, as applicable) outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the duties of the members of the
Company Board to the Company\'s     47    stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements, but only after following the Superior Proposal
Termination Procedures.   (d) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX, the Company
shall immediately (i) request that all confidential information previously
furnished to any third party be returned promptly and (ii) deny access to any
data room containing any such information to any third party (other than the
Parent Parties and their respective Representatives), in each case, subject
to the Company\'s rights and obligations in Section 7.04(a).  (e) Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board
from making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders) or from making any legally required disclosure to
stockholders.   Section 7.05 Employee Benefits Matters.   (a) From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall assume in accordance
with their terms the Company\'s obligations under all employment, severance
and termination plans, arrangements, programs, policies, and agreements
(including change-in-control provisions) of employees or independent
contractors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case existing
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement. Copies of agreements
with the Company\'s President, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice
President - Acquisitions (the "Executive Officers") setting forth certain of
such obligations are attached to Section 7.05 of the Disclosure Schedule. As
of the Effective Time, the Company will enter into escrow
agreements, substantially in the form attached to Section 7.05 of the
Disclosure Schedule, with an escrow agent and with each such Executive
Officer, which shall be used to fund payments which become due to the
Executive Officers as the result of a change in control, and the Company
shall deposit all such amounts set forth in Section 7.05 of the Disclosure
Schedule to the escrow funds established pursuant to such escrow agreements,
subject to the terms thereof. Such escrow agreements shall be binding upon
the Surviving Entity.   (b) For a period of not less than eighteen (18)
months after the Closing Date, for each employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Employees") who remains an
employee of the Surviving Entity or its successors or assigns or any of
their subsidiaries (collectively, the "Continuing Employees"), Parent shall
or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide terms and conditions,
compensation and benefits (including group health, life, disability, bonus
and severance plans) that are not less favorable in the aggregate to such
employee and the employee\'s dependents and beneficiaries, as appropriate, as
the Company or such Subsidiary of the Company provided to such employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date. To the extent a Continuing Employee
becomes eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan, program, or
arrangement maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries (each, a "Parent Plan"),
such Continuing Employee will be credited with his or her years of service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities thereof)
before the Closing Date under such Parent Plan to the same extent as such
employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service
under the respective Plan (except to the extent such credit would    
48    result in the duplication of benefits). In addition, with respect to
each Parent Plan providing medical or health benefits in which Continuing
Employees become eligible to participate, during the calendar year that
includes the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for
amounts paid by the employee under the respective Plan for purposes of
applying deductibles, co-payments and out of pocket maximums as though such
amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
Parent Plan. To the extent applicable, nothing in this section shall modify
any Continuing Employee\'s status as an at-will employee.   (c) Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-
employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the
interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or
director of the Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes
of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
("Section 16") of Company Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement and the
Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.   (d)
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall take such actions as are
necessary to terminate the Company\'s 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for
Non-Employee Directors. Such action shall be contingent upon, and effective
as of, the Effective Time.   (e) The provisions of this Section 7.05 shall
survive the Closing and are for the sole benefit of the parties to this
Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or to give to any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns any legal or
equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided
for in this Section 7.05) under or by reason of any provision of this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7.05 is intended as or shall be construed
to be an amendment to any Plan.   Section 7.06 Directors\' and Officers\'
Indemnification and Insurance.   (a) Without limiting any additional rights
that any director or officer may have under any employment or indemnification
agreement or under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the Operating
Partnership Agreement or this Agreement or, if applicable, similar
organizational documents or agreements of any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries,
from and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date
on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent and the Surviving Entity, jointly
and severally, shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at
the date hereof or during the period from the date hereof through the date of
the Effective Time serving as a director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by applicable law, as now or hereafter in
effect, in connection with any Claim and any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom;
and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within ten (10) days after any request
for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in
effect, any Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect
to or otherwise     49   participating with respect to any Claim in
advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf
of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to
such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement
of any bond or other security). The indemnification and advancement
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity pursuant to this Section
7.06(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the
Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions,
including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken
in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all rights to
indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a
person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such
person\'s heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As used in
this Section 7.06(a): (x) the term "Claim" means any threatened, asserted,
pending or completed Action, whether instituted by any party hereto, any
Governmental Authority or any other person, that any Indemnified Party
in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any Action,
whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including
any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising
out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Party\'s
duties or service as a director or officer of the Company, or any of its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time; and (y) the term "Expenses"
means reasonable attorneys\' fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses
and obligations (including experts\' fees, travel expenses, court costs,
retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well
as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness
in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized
pursuant to this Section 7.06(a), including any Action relating to a claim
for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Neither
Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened Action in respect of which
indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such Action without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.   (b) Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors
or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws,
partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement, or other
organizational documents of any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries) and
indemnification agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
assumed by the Surviving Entity in the Merger, without further action, at the
Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms.   (c) For a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time, the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Entity
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification
and limitations on liability of directors and officers than are set forth in
the      50    Company Charter and Company Bylaws, which provisions
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
Indemnified Parties, unless such modification shall be required by Law and
then only to the minimum extent required by Law.   (d) Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain for a period of six (6) years
following the Effective Time policies of directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance with coverage substantially equivalent to the current policies of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company and
its Subsidiaries (provided that the Surviving Entity may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured from carriers with
the same or better rating as the carrier of such insurances as of the date of
this Agreement, provided that such substitution shall not result in gaps or
lapses of coverage with respect to matters occurring before the Effective
Time) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
before the Effective Time, including, in respect of the Merger and the
Contemplated Transactions. The provisions of this Section 7.06(d) shall be
deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" policies have been obtained
by the Surviving Entity for purposes of this Section 7.06 from carriers with
the same or better rating as the carrier of such insurances as of the date of
this Agreement, which policies provide such directors and officers with the
coverage described in this Section 7.06(d) for an aggregate period of not
less than six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, in respect of the
Merger and the Contemplated Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Entity
be required under this Section 7.06(d) to expend annually in excess of two
hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company under the Company\'s current directors\' and officers\' insurance
policy (the "Insurance Amount"); provided, further, however, that if the
premium of such insurance coverage exceeds the Insurance Amount, the Company
shall be obligated to obtain, and Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be
obligated to maintain, a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding the Insurance Amount. Parent shall pay or cause Surviving
Entity to pay for all premiums under the tail or run-off insurance policies
and directors\' and officers\' insurance and indemnification policies
contemplated by this Section 7.06(d) not exceeding the Insurance Amount.  
(e) If the Surviving Entity or any of its respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Entity assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 7.06.   (f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to perform
all of the obligations of the Surviving Entity under this Section 7.06.  
(g) This Section 7.06 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and personal representatives,
and shall be binding on the Surviving Entity and its    
51   successors and assigns. In the event that the Surviving Entity or any
of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all its properties and assets to any Person (including by
dissolution), then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Entity assume and honor the obligations set forth in this Section 7.06.  
Section 7.07 Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts.   (a) Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto
shall (i) make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, under the HSR Act with respect to this Agreement and
the Merger, if required, and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Merger, including using its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities and
parties to contracts with the Company and its Subsidiaries as are necessary
for the consummation of the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions and to
fulfill the conditions to the Merger, including (x) consents set forth in
Section 4.05(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, and (y) consents required to
prevent, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect
from occurring prior to the Effective Time. Any costs or expenses in
connection with obtaining any consent referred to in the prior sentence shall
be the responsibility of the Parent Parties, except for costs or expenses in
connection with a consent referred to in clause (y), which shall be the
responsibility of the Company.   (b) The parties hereto agree to cooperate
and assist one another in connection with all actions to be taken pursuant to
Section 7.07(a), including the preparation and making of the filings referred
to therein and, if requested, amending or furnishing additional
information thereunder, including, subject to applicable Law and the
Confidentiality Agreement, providing copies of all related documents to the
non-filing party and their advisors prior to filing, and, to the extent
practicable, neither of the parties will file any such document or have any
communication with any Governmental Authority without prior consultation with
the other party. Each party shall keep the other apprised of the content and
status of any communications with, and communications from, any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions. To
the extent practicable and permitted by a Governmental Authority, each party
hereto shall permit representatives of the other party to participate in
meetings and calls with such Governmental Authority.   (c) Each of the
parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to
defend through litigation on the merits any Action, including administrative
or judicial Action, asserted by any party in order to avoid the entry of, or
to have vacated, lifted, reversed, terminated or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that in whole or in part restricts, delays, prevents or prohibits
consummation of the Merger, including, without limitation, by vigorously
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.    
52     (d) The Company Parties, at the expense of the Parent Parties
(which shall be paid or reimbursed promptly upon request by the Company
Parties), shall assist (i) with the defeasance by the Parent Parties of
existing loans of the Company Parties (to the extent defeasance is permitted
thereunder), (ii) the Parent Parties in the assumption of any of loans of the
Company Parties which are not subject to defeasance, and (iii) with the
assignment of permits and licenses and obtaining estoppels with respect to
real property of the Company Parties.   Section 7.08 Transfer Taxes. Parent
and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of
all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any
real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock
transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees
and any similar taxes that become payable in connection with the Merger and
the Contemplated Transactions (together with any related interests, penalties
or additions to Tax, "Transfer Taxes"), and shall cooperate in attempting to
minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall pay or cause to be paid, without deduction or
withholding from any consideration or amounts payable to holders of the
Company Common Shares and holders of Existing Units, all Transfer Taxes.  
Section 7.09 Public Announcements. The parties hereto agree that no public
release or announcement concerning the Merger or the Contemplated
Transactions shall be issued by a party without the prior consent of the
other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or
the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon the
form of a joint press release announcing the Merger and the execution of this
Agreement.   Section 7.10 Financing.   (a) Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange and consummate the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter (provided that the Parent
Parties may replace or amend the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities which had not
executed the Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, or otherwise so long as
the terms would not reasonably be expected to adversely impact the ability of
the Parent Parties to consummate the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions
or the likelihood of consummation of the Merger and the Contemplated
Transactions or delay the Closing), including (i) satisfying on a timely
basis all terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter;
(ii) entering into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms
and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter; (iii) enforcing its
rights under the Commitment Letter; and (iv) consummating the Financing at or
prior to Closing. Parent will furnish correct and complete copies of all such
definitive agreements to the Company promptly upon their execution.   (b)
Parent shall keep the Company informed with respect to all material activity
concerning the status of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter
and shall give the Company prompt notice of any material change with respect
to such Financing. Without     53    limiting the foregoing, Parent
agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within two (2)
Business Days, if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) the Commitment
Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason, or (ii) any financing
source that is a party to the Commitment Letter notifies Parent that such
source no longer intends to provide financing to Parent on the terms set
forth therein. Parent shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter,
the Commitment Letter in any manner that would materially impair, delay or
prevent the Merger or the Contemplated Transactions without the prior written
consent of the Company, and shall provide the Company promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) with any amendments or alterations to the Commitment
Letter.   (c) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter or the Commitment
Letter shall be terminated for any reason, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange to obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger and the
Contemplated Transactions and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain, and will provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing
commitment that provides for at least the same amount of financing as such
Commitment Letter as originally issued and on terms and conditions (including
termination rights and funding conditions) no less favorable to Parent or
Merger Sub than those included in such Commitment Letter.   Section 7.11
Stockholder and Limited Partner Litigation. In case of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors or limited partner
litigation against the Operating Partnership and/or the Company, as its
general partner, in each case, relating to the Merger or the Contemplated
Transactions, the Company Parties and/or counsel(s) selected by such
directors or the Company will control the defense of any such
litigation; provided that the Company Parties shall (a) promptly notify (and
thereafter keep apprised of any material development relating thereto) the
Parent Parties of any such stockholder or limited partner litigation, (b)
provide the Parent Parties and their outside counsel with the opportunity to
participate in the defense of any such stockholder or limited partner
litigation, including by providing copies of any pleadings or motions to be
filed by the Company Parties and/or the directors of the Company reasonably
in advance of any planned filing thereof, and considering in good faith any
comments or recommendations with respect thereto by the Parent Parties and
their outside counsel and by otherwise consulting with and considering in
good faith any comments or recommendations of the Parent Parties and their
outside counsel in connection therewith; provided, however, that counsel to
the Company or such directors shall make any ultimate decision based on the
best interests of the Company or such directors as applicable, and (c) not
settle, compromise or otherwise resolve any such stockholder or limited
partner litigation brought prior to Closing without the consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided, that it shall not be unreasonable for Parent to withhold such
consent if such settlement, compromise or resolution does not include a
release of the Company Parties and the Parent Parties and their respective
Representatives and Affiliates, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
in the event the Company must contribute to such settlement, separate and
apart from any amounts contributed by the Company\'s insurers, an amount
greater than the amount set forth in Section 7.11 of the Disclosure Schedule;
provided, however, that no Person shall be required to provide access to or
to disclose information where such access or disclosure would reasonably be
expected to jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of any such
Person.     54     Section 7.12 Fees and Expenses. The Surviving
Entity shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying
Agent, in connection with the transactions contemplated in Article III, and

the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. The filing fees for
the premerger notification and report forms under the HSR Act, if any, shall
be shared 50% by the Parent Parties and 50% by the Company Parties.  
Section 7.13 State Takeover Laws. If any "fair price," "moratorium" or
"control share acquisition" statute or other similar anti-takeover statute or
regulation enacted under state Laws in the United States is or shall become
applicable to the Merger or the Contemplated Transactions, the Parent Parties
and the Company and their respective boards of directors shall, subject to
Section 7.04, use commercially reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the Merger and the Contemplated
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such
statute or regulation on the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions.  
Section 7.14 Notification of Certain Matters. Subject to applicable Laws and
the instructions of any Governmental Entity, each of the Company Parties and
the Parent Parties shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters

communications received by the Parent Parties or the Company, as the case may
be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third Person and/or any Governmental

Governmental Entity, neither the Company nor any Parent Party shall permit
any of its officers or any other Representatives to participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings, investigation
or other inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat.   Section 7.15 Resignations.

entering into of an Acquisition Agreement for a Superior Proposal but only if
(i) after providing a written Superior Proposal Notice to Parent, (ii) in
light of such Superior Proposal a majority of the disinterested directors of
the Company Board and the Special Committee shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to withdraw,
qualify or modify the Company Board Recommendation would be inconsistent with
the duties of the members of the Company Board to the Company\'s shareholders
under applicable Legal Requirements, (iii) the Company shall have promptly
notified Parent in writing of the determinations described in clause (ii)
above, (iv) at least three (3) Business Days following receipt by Parent of
the Superior Proposal Notice, and taking into account any revised proposal
made by Parent following receipt of the Superior Proposal Notice, a majority
of the disinterested directors of the Company Board and the Special Committee
has concluded such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and has
again made the determinations referred to in clause (ii) above (the steps in
clauses (i) through (iv) above, the "Superior Proposal Termination
Procedures"), and (v) the Company has paid the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 9.03(a)(i) simultaneously with such termination (any
purported termination pursuant to this Section 9.01(h) shall be void and of
no force or effect unless the Company shall have made such payment).  
Section 9.02 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Article IX, this Agreement shall forthwith become
void and be of no further force or effect and the Merger and the Contemplated
Transactions shall be abandoned without further action by any of the parties
hereto without any further liability or obligation on the part of any party
hereto or its respective Affiliates; provided, however, that (i) this Section
9.02, Section 9.03 and Article X shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect, and (ii) the termination
of this Agreement shall not relieve any party from any liability for any
willful breach of any of its representations or warranties or any willful
breach of any of its covenants or other provision agreements contained in
this Agreement prior to such termination.   Section 9.03 Fees and
Expenses.   (a) Except as set forth in Section 7.12 and in this Section
9.03, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger and any of the Contemplated Transactions (including fees and expenses
payable to Representatives) shall be paid by the party hereto incurring such
fees and expenses, whether or not the Contemplated Transactions are
consummated; provided, however, that:   (i) if this Agreement is terminated
by (A) Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(i), Section 9.01(d)(iii) or Section
9.01(g) or (B) the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(h), then the Company
shall pay to Parent in accordance with Section 9.03(b), in the    
59    case of a termination pursuant to clause (A) above, as promptly as
practicable following such termination (and, in any event, within two (2)
Business Days following such termination), and in the case of a termination
pursuant to clause (B) above, at or prior to the time of, and as a condition
to the effectiveness of, such termination, in each case, an amount equal to
the Company Termination Fee;   (ii) if this Agreement is terminated by (A)
Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(f) or (B) the Company pursuant to Section
9.01(f), then the Company shall pay to Parent in accordance with Section
9.03(b) the Parent Expenses promptly following receipt of an invoice
therefor, together with a documented itemization setting forth in reasonable
detail all of the Parent Expenses for which the Buyer Parties are seeking
reimbursement, provided that if (A) prior to such termination, an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made to the Company Parties or publicly announced
prior to such termination date, and for purposes of this Section 9.03(a)(ii),
"50%" shall be substituted for "20%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal, and (B) concurrently with the termination of this Agreement or
within twelve (12) months thereafter, the Company enters into an Acquisition
Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal
is consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent in accordance with
Section 9.03(b), on the earlier of the date that the Company enters into the
Acquisition Agreement or such Acquisition Proposal is consummated, an amount
equal to the Company Termination Fee less all Parent Expenses previously
paid;   (iii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 9.01(b), and (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made to the Company Parties or publicly announced prior to such termination
date, and for purposes of this Section 9.03(a)(iii), "50%" shall be
substituted for "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal, and
(B) concurrently with the termination of this Agreement or within twelve
(12) months thereafter, the Company enters into an Acquisition Agreement
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal is
consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent in accordance with Section
9.03(b), on the earlier of the date that the Company enters into the
Acquisition Agreement or such Acquisition Proposal is consummated, an amount
equal to the Company Termination Fee; and   (iv) if this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(ii), then (A) Parent and
Merger Sub shall collectively pay the Company the Company Expenses promptly
following receipt of an invoice therefor, together with a documented
itemization setting forth in reasonable detail all of the Company Expenses
for which the Company Parties are seeking reimbursement and (B) the Company
shall pay to Parent in accordance with Section 9.03(b) the Parent Expenses
promptly following receipt of an invoice therefor, together with a documented
itemization setting forth in reasonable detail all of the Parent Expenses for
which the Buyer Parties are seeking reimbursement, provided that if (A) prior
to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the
Company Parties or publicly announced prior to such termination date, and for
purposes of this Section 9.03(a)(iv), "50%" shall be substituted for "20%" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal, and (B) concurrently with the
termination of this Agreement or within twelve (12) months thereafter, the
Company enters into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall
pay to Parent in accordance with Section 9.03(b), on the earlier of the date
that the Company enters into the Acquisition     60    Agreement or
such Acquisition Proposal is consummated, an amount equal to the Company
Termination Fee less the Net Parent Expenses; provided however that if this
Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(ii) and
the Company has taken any action, or failed to take any commercially
reasonable action, that has caused any representations or warranties of
either of the Company Parties to become inaccurate such that the condition
set forth in Section 8.02(a) is incapable of being satisfied, then Parent
shall not be required to pay the Company Expenses to the Company and the
Company shall pay to Parent in accordance with Section 9.03(b), as promptly
as practicable following the termination of this Agreement (and, in any
event, within two (2) Business Days following such termination), the Company
Termination Fee.   (v) if this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 9.01(e), including as a result of a breach by
either Parent or Merger Sub of its respective obligations to effect the
Closing pursuant to Section 2.04 and satisfy its obligations under Article
III, including depositing (or causing to be deposited) with the Paying
Agent sufficient funds to make all payments necessary pursuant to Section
3.03, then Parent and Merger Sub shall collectively pay to the Company or as
directed by the Company (A) the Company Expenses promptly following receipt
of an invoice therefor, together with a documented itemization setting forth
in reasonable detail all of the Company Expenses for which the Company
Parties are seeking reimbursement and (B) the Reverse Termination Fee as
promptly as possible (but in any event within three Business Days) following
termination of this Agreement.   (b) In the event that the Company is
required to pay the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses, in each
case, such amount shall be paid by the Company by wire transfer of cash in
immediately available funds to a bank account of Parent or its designee(s) as
directed at least one (1) Business Day prior to the relevant date of such
payment by Parent in writing to the Company.   (c) The parties hereto agree
and understand that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses on more than one occasion and
that the Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to pay the Reverse
Termination Fee and the Company Expenses on more than one occasion. The
parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.03
are an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions, and that, without
these agreements, the parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement. In
the event any party hereto is required to file suit to seek all or portion of
the amounts payable under this Section 9.03, and such party hereto prevails
in such litigation, such party hereto shall be awarded to all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses, that it has
incurred in enforcing its rights under this Section 9.03.   (d) For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Parent Expenses" shall mean the
aggregate amount of the fees and expenses (including all reasonable
attorneys\' fees, accountants\' fees, financial advisory fees, investment
banking fees, commitment fees, costs and expenses related to interest rate
hedges, filing fees and printing and mailing expenses, filing fees under the
HSR Act, expenses incurred by Parent Parties in connection with any
application, filing, consents relating directly or indirectly to the closing
of the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions, including consents, waivers
and approvals relating to franchisors, defeasance     61    or
assumption of indebtedness or approvals of any Governmental Authority)
that have been paid or that become payable by or on behalf of the Parent
Parties in connection with the preparation, negotiation and enforcement of
this Agreement and otherwise in connection with the Merger and the
Contemplated Transactions, provided that the amount of Parent Expenses
payable by the Company shall not exceed $10,000,000 in the aggregate. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Company Expenses" shall mean the
aggregate amount of money expended by the Company at the direction of Parent
(i) in connection with the Company\'s obligations under Section 7.16 and (ii)
pursuant to Section 7.07(d). For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Net
Parent Expenses" shall mean the Parent Expenses less the Company Expenses;
provided that to the extent such calculation results in a negative amount,
Net Parent Expenses shall be zero.   (e) The Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to Parent, or its assignee hereunder, such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by the Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Parent, or its assignee
hereunder, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Company.   Section 9.04 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the Company (by action of the Special Committee or, if the Special
Committee no longer exists, the Company Board) on the one hand, and Parent,
on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any
obligation or other act of the Parent Parties or the Company Parties, as the
case may be, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties
of the Parent Parties or the Company Parties, as the case may be, contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any agreement of the Parent Parties or the Company Parties, as the case
may be, or any condition to its own obligations contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed by the Company or Parent. The failure of any party to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights.   Section 9.05 Payment by Parent. In the event that Parent
and Merger Sub are obligated to pay any payments to the Company pursuant to
this Agreement (the "Parent Payment"), Parent and Merger Sub shall pay to
the Company, from the Parent Payment deposited into escrow in accordance with
the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Parent Payment
and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Company
without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did
not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(H) or 856(c)(3)(I) of
the Code ("Qualifying Income"), as determined by the Company\'s independent
public accountants, plus (B) in the event the Company receives either (x) a
letter from the Company\'s counsel indicating that the Company has received a
ruling from the IRS described below in this Section 9.05 (but in any case not
to increase the amount of the Parent Payment) or (y) an opinion from
the Company\'s outside counsel as described below in this Section 9.05, an
amount equal to the Parent Payment less the amount payable under clause (A)
above. To secure Parent\'s and Merger Sub\'s obligation to pay these amounts,
Parent and Merger Sub shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to
the Parent Payment with an     62    escrow agent selected by Parent
and on such terms (subject to this Section 9.05) as shall be mutually agreed
upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into
escrow of the Parent Payment pursuant to this Section 9.05 shall be made at
the time Parent and Merger Sub are obligated to pay the Company such amount
by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide that the Parent Payment
in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Company unless
the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a
letter from the Company\'s independent public accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Company without
causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from the Company\'s
accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall
release such amount to the Company, or (ii) a letter from the Company\'s
counsel indicating that the Company received a ruling from the IRS holding
that the receipt by the Company of the Parent Payment would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, the Company\'s
outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt
by the Company of the Parent Payment would either constitute Qualifying
Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which case the escrow agent shall release
the remainder of the Parent Payment to the Company. Parent agrees to amend
this Section 9.05 at the reasonable request of the Company in order to (i)
maximize the portion of the Parent Payment that may be distributed to the
Company hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii) improve the
Company\'s chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this
Section 9.05 or (iii) assist the Company in obtaining a favorable legal
opinion from its outside counsel as described in this Section 9.05. The
escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Parent Payment
held in escrow for five (5) years shall be released by the escrow agent to
Parent. Parent and Merger Sub shall not be a party to such escrow agreement
and shall not bear any cost of or have liability resulting from the escrow
agreement. In the event that Parent or Merger Sub is required to pay the
Parent Payment pursuant to a termination of this Agreement, such amount shall
be paid into escrow as provided in this Section 9.05 as promptly as
practicable following such termination, but in no event more than two (2)
Business Days following such termination.    ARTICLE X   GENERAL
PROVISIONS   Section 10.01 Non-Survival of Representations and
Warranties. The representations and warranties in this Agreement and in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall terminate at the Effective
Time.   Section 10.02 Non-Survival of Certain Covenants. The covenants to

George H. Vincent, Esq.    Section 10.04 Severability. If any term or other
provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Merger or the
Contemplated Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to
any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.   Section 10.05
Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action
taken by their respective board of directors (or similar governing body or
entity) or, as to the Company, by the Special Committee, or, if the Special
Committee no longer exists, by the Company Board at any time prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that, after Company Stockholder Approval,
no amendment may be made without further stockholder approval which, by Law
or in accordance with the rules of the NYSE, requires further approval by
such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed by the parties hereto.   Section 10.06 Entire Agreement;
Assignment. This Agreement, the Guaranty and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant
to a merger, by operation of Law or     66    otherwise), except that
each of the Parent Parties may assign all or any of its rights and
obligations hereunder to any of their respective Affiliates; provided, that
no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations
hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations or delay the
Closing and provided, further, that such assignment would not reasonably be
expected to adversely impact the ability of the Parent Parties to consummate
the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions or the likelihood of
consummation of the Merger and the Contemplated Transactions or delay
the Closing.   Section 10.07 Enforcement of Agreement.   (a)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company\'s right
to terminate and receive payment of the Reverse Termination Fee and the
Company Expenses pursuant to Section 9.03(a)(v) and the amounts payable
pursuant to Section 9.03(c), Section 9.03(a)(iv), Section 7.03(a) and Section
7.07(d) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy against Parent, Merger Sub and
any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, partners, members,
directors, officer or agents. The parties acknowledge that the Company shall
not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and that the Company\'s sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any such breach shall be the remedy set forth in Section 10.07(a); provided,
however, that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to
prevent any breach by the Parent Parties of or enforce their compliance with
Section 7.03(b) and Section 7.09. The Company agrees that, to the extent it
or its Subsidiaries have incurred losses or damages in connection with this
Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, (i) the maximum aggregate liability
of the Parent Parties and the Guarantor for such losses or damages shall be
limited to the amount set forth in the Guaranty and (ii) the maximum
liability of the Guarantor, directly or indirectly, shall be limited to the
obligations of such Guarantor under the Guaranty. Upon payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee and the Company Expense pursuant to Section 9.03(a)(v) and
the amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.03(c), Section 9.03(a)(iv), Section
7.03(a) and Section 7.07(d), none of Parent and Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, stockholders, partners, members, directors, officer or
agents shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent\'s and
Merger Sub\'s right to terminate this Agreement and receive, as applicable,
the payment of the Company Termination Fee, Parent Expense and/or Net Parent
Expenses pursuant to Section 9.01(h), Section 9.03(a)(i),
Section 9.03(a)(ii), Section 9.03(a)(iii) and Section 9.03(a)(iv) and the
amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.03(c), shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and
any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders, partners, members,
directors, officer or agents; provided, that the parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
were not performed by the Company or in accordance with the terms hereof or
were otherwise breached and that, prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01, the Parent Parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or an
injunction to prevent any breach of this Agreement, in addition to any other
remedy at law or equity. Whether or not Parent or Merger Sub seeks specific
performance pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, in no event
shall Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to damages     67    in excess
of the Company Termination Fee. Upon payment, as applicable, of the Company
Termination. Parent Expenses and/or Net Parent Expenses pursuant to Section
9.01(h), Section 9.03(a)(i), Section 9.03(a)(ii), Section 9.03(a)(iii) and
Section 9.03(a)(iv) and the amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.03(c), none
of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates,
stockholders, partners, members, directors, officer or agents shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties acknowledge
that the Company shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and that the Company\'s sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to any such breach shall be the remedy set forth in
Section 10.07(a); provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled
to seek specific performance to prevent any breach by the Parent Parties of
or enforce their compliance with Section 7.03(b) and Section 7.09.  
Section 10.08 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Agreement, other than the provisions of Section 7.06 (which
are intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby or the
persons entitled to payment thereunder and may be enforced by such
persons).   Section 10.09 Governing Law; Forum. This Agreement shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Maryland applicable to contracts between residents of that State and executed

waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in

that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the
Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is
improper, or that this Agreement or the Merger or the Contemplated
Transactions may not be enforced in or by any federal or state court within
Baltimore County, Maryland.   Section 10.10 Headings. The descriptive
headings contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.   Section 10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be

each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
