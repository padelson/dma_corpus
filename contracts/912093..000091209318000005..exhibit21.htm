Working Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness or Conveyed
Entity Transaction Expenses as set forth on the Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement, the Sellers shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement,
specifying the nature and amount of any dispute as to Closing Date Net Working
Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness or Conveyed Entity
Transaction Expenses within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Purchase
Price Adjustment Statement to the Sellers (the "Objection Disputes"). The
Sellers shall conclusively be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts
of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness and Conveyed Entity Transaction Expenses to
which the Sellers have not specifically objected in the written notice of
Objection Dispute, and such items and amounts shall not be subject to review
under Section 2.3(e). Any Objection Dispute may only reference objections
based on mathematical errors or based on amounts of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Indebtedness or Conveyed
Entity Transaction Expenses not being calculated on a basis consistent with
the methods, policies, practices, procedures, assumptions conventions and
adjustments set forth on Annex B. The failure of the Sellers to deliver a
written notice of an Objection Dispute to Buyer within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement to the Sellers shall
conclusively be deemed acceptance of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement
and agreement to the Purchase Price Adjustment amount by the Sellers.

(e) Subject to Section 2.3(d), Buyer and the Sellers shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve any Objection Dispute and any resolution agreed to in writing
by Buyer and the Sellers shall be final and binding upon the Parties. If Buyer
and the Sellers are unable to resolve all Objection Disputes within twenty
(20) days of delivery of a valid written notice of such Objection Disputes by
the Sellers to Buyer, then the disputed matters shall be submitted to the
Accounting Expert for final determination, and any discussions between Buyer
and the Sellers during the previously referenced twenty (20) day period shall
(unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and the Sellers) be governed by Rule 408 of
the Federal Rule of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule. Buyer and
the Sellers shall jointly select an accounting firm to serve as the Accounting
Expert; provided that such accounting firm shall be of national standing and
shall not be an independent auditor of (and shall not otherwise serve as a
consultant to) either Buyer or the Sellers (or their respective Affiliates).
If Buyer and the Sellers are unable to agree upon an accounting firm within
fifteen (15) days, then an accounting firm of international standing shall be
designated by the American Arbitration Association in New York, New York;
provided, that such firm shall not be the independent auditor of (or otherwise
serve as a consultant to) either Buyer or the Sellers (or their respective
Affiliates) (such accounting firm as determined in accordance with this
Section 2.3(e), the "Accounting Expert"). The Accounting Expert shall only
consider those items and amounts set forth on the Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement as to which Buyer and the Sellers have disagreed within the time
periods and amounts and on the terms specified in Section 2.3(d) and must
resolve all unresolved Objection Disputes in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. The Accounting Expert shall deliver to Buyer and
the Sellers, as promptly as practicable and in any event within sixty (60)
days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of
any unresolved Objection Disputes determined in accordance with the terms
herein. The Accounting Expert shall select as a resolution for each Objection
Dispute a value no greater than the greatest value assigned to such item by
Buyer, on the one hand, or the Sellers, on the other hand, or less than the
smallest value assigned to such item by Buyer, on the one hand, or the
Sellers, on the other hand (based solely on presentations and supporting
material provided by the Parties and not pursuant to any independent review),
and may not impose an alternative resolution. Such report shall be final and
binding upon all of the Parties to this Agreement, absent manifest error or
fraud. Upon the agreement of Buyer and the Sellers or the decision of the
Accounting Expert, or if the Sellers fail to deliver written notice of
disagreement to Buyer within the thirty (30) day period provided in Section
2.3(d), the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as adjusted if necessary pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be the
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement for purposes of calculating the Purchase
Price Adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.3.

(f) The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Expert shall be borne by
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the disputed amount not awarded to each Party
bears to the amount actually disputed by such Party. For example, if Buyer
claims the Closing Consideration Amount is $1,000 less than the amount
determined by the Sellers, and the Sellers contest only $500 of the amount
claimed by Buyer, and if the Accounting Expert ultimately resolves the dispute
by awarding Buyer $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of
the Accounting Expert will be allocated 60 percent (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the
Sellers and 40 percent (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to Buyer.

(g) Any Purchase Price Adjustment shall be paid by Buyer or the Sellers, as
applicable, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Party, or its designee, receiving such payment within five
(5) Business Days after the final determination of the Purchase Price
Adjustment, with interest thereon from and including the Closing Date to but
not including the date of payment at an annual rate equal to the prime lending
rate prevailing at such time, as published in the Wall Street Journal,
provided, however, that any portion of the Purchase Price Adjustment as to
which there is no dispute or as to which agreement has been reached shall be
paid within five (5) Business Days after its determination or after reaching
such agreement.

(h) The Sellers and Buyer agree to treat any payment made pursuant to this
Section 2.3 as an adjustment to the Closing Consideration Amount for all Tax
purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, any such adjustment shall be taken into
account in the determination of liability for Taxes under Section 5.13(a).

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no item shall
be counted more than once in the determination of Closing Date Indebtedness,
Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Net Working Capital or Conveyed Entity
Transaction Expenses. Any item used in determining Estimated Closing Date
Indebtedness, Estimated Closing Date Cash, Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital or Estimated Conveyed Entity Transaction Expenses shall retain that
classification in the preparation of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement.
To the extent an adjustment is made to the Closing Consideration Amount under
this Section 2.3, Buyer may not bring a claim under any other provision of
this Agreement seeking recovery for Losses in respect of such adjustment.

(j) The Parties agree that in determining the amount of inventory for purposes
of determining the Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Sellers and Buyer
shall jointly conduct a physical count of all the inventory of the Conveyed
Entities three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, or on such other
date as mutually agreed, which physical count shall be conducted in accordance
with policies and procedures to be agreed by the Parties, based upon the
applicable policies and procedures used by the Conveyed Entities in conducting
physical counts of all Inventory during the 2017 calendar year as previously
provided to Buyer. The physical counting process shall be observed by
representatives of one accounting firm chosen by Buyer and one accounting firm chosen by the Sellers. For purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Inventory Amount" shall mean the physical count of inventory of the
Conveyed Entities, as rolled forward or backward from the date of the account,
so as to be the amount of inventory of the Conveyed Entities existing as of
11:59 P.M. on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date, as agreed to by
the Sellers and Buyer in accordance with this Section 2.3(j). If the Sellers
and Buyer agree on such count, the Inventory Amount, as so agreed, shall be
used by the Sellers for purposes of determining the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital and by the Parties for purposes of determining Closing Date
Net Working Capital for purposes of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement.
If the Sellers and Buyer cannot agree on the results of such count, the
Sellers shall use their calculation of the Inventory Amount for purposes of
determining the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital and Buyer shall use
its calculation of the Inventory Amount for purposes of determining Closing
Date Net Working Capital for purposes of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement, and any disputes shall then be settled by the Accounting Expert in
accordance with Section 2.3(e).

Section 2.4 Allocation of Consideration. Within ninety (90) days following the
Closing, Buyer shall provide to the Sellers, for the Sellers' review and
comment, a draft schedule allocating the Closing Consideration Amount and
other relevant items among the Direct Transferred Equity Interests, and the
further allocation of the amount allocated to the U.S. Conveyed Entity among
the assets of the U.S. Conveyed Entity in accordance with Sections 338 and
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. Buyer
and the Sellers shall work together in good faith to agree on the final
allocation of the Closing Consideration Amount and other relevant items among
the Direct Transferred Equity Interests and among the assets of the U.S.
Conveyed Entity. If Buyer and the Sellers are unable to agree upon a final
allocation schedule within thirty (30) days of Buyer providing the draft
allocation schedule, any dispute shall be resolved in a manner substantially
similar to that described in Section 2.3(e) above. In the event an adjustment
to the Closing Consideration Amount is made pursuant to Section 2.2 or Section
2.3 or otherwise under this Agreement (including under Article VIII) (and any
refunds and/or other payments are made in connection therewith), the
allocation of the Closing Consideration Amount shall be revised to allocate
such adjustment to the Direct Transferred Equity Interests based upon the item
to which such adjustment is attributable. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law or a relevant Taxing Authority (a) this final allocation shall
be binding on the Parties for federal, state, local, non-U.S. and other Tax
reporting purposes, (b) no Party will assert or maintain a position
inconsistent with this final allocation and (c) the applicable Tax Returns to
be filed by any of the Parties or their Subsidiaries shall reflect this final
allocation.

Section 2.5 Closing.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the purchase and
sale of the Conveyed Entity Equity Interests contemplated hereby shall take
place at a closing (the "Closing") to be held at 9:00 a.m. (New York time) no
later than three Business Days after the last of the conditions to Closing set

Buffalo, NY 14202, or at such other time or on such other date or at such other place as the Sellers

takes place being the "Closing Date"). Except to the extent expressly set
forth in this Agreement to the contrary, and notwithstanding the actual

and the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be

Section 3.3 Conveyed Entities; Capital Structure; Subsidiaries; German
Revenue.

jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of each Conveyed Entity. Each of
the Conveyed Entities is duly incorporated or formed and validly existing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, with the
corporate power or similar power (if applicable), capacity and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as currently conducted. Each of the Conveyed Entities is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing (to the extent the applicable jurisdiction
recognizes such concept) under the Laws of each jurisdiction in which the
conduct of its business, or the character of the properties owned or leased by
it, makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Section 3.3(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and

(ii) securities or rights (including appreciation rights, phantom stock and

outstanding shares, capital stock or other equity or ownership interests of
any such Subsidiaries are owned beneficially, legally and of record by a
Conveyed Entity. No Conveyed Entity owns, whether directly or indirectly, any
Equity Securities or other equity or ownership interests in any Person that is

hereof.

Entity (collectively, "Governmental Filings") are required in connection with

the HSR Act; (b) Governmental Filings under anti-trust or other competition
Laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States ("Foreign Antitrust
Laws"); (c) Governmental Filings under or in accordance with Export Control

would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a

the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents contemplated hereby and the

Affiliates (or any of the Conveyed Entities) (with or without lapse of time,
notice or both); or (c) violate the certificate of incorporation, by-laws,
constitution or other equivalent governing or constitutional documents of any
Seller or any of its Affiliates (or any of the Conveyed Entities) except, with
respect to the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Schedule contains (i) internally prepared balance sheets of the U.S. Conveyed
Entity as of December 31, 2015, December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017,

presented.

Section 3.7 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as and to the extent reflected,
accrued or reserved for on the balance sheets as of the Balance Sheet Date
included in the Financial Statements, the Conveyed Entities do not have, and
are not subject to, any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) or obligations of any nature, required to be reflected, accrued or
reserved for on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with IFRS, or in the
notes thereto, other than any liabilities or obligations incurred since the
Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
practice that are not, individually or in the aggregate, material to the
Conveyed Entities.

the periods involved, all transactions of the Conveyed Entities. All of the

or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) result in material
injunctive relief against any of the Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates relating to any of the Conveyed Entities or against any Conveyed
Entity, (iii) result in any civil or criminal sanction or fine by any

administered in accordance with its terms (including the terms of external
pension funds) and all applicable Laws; (ii) there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers,

than routine claims for benefits; (iii) none of the Conveyed Entities or any
of the Sellers or any of their other Affiliates has received any notice that
any such Transferred Plan is under audit or investigation by any Governmental
Entity, and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, no such audit or investigation is
threatened, other than, in the case of clauses (i), (ii), and/or (iii),
failures or circumstances that would not be reasonably expected to result in
any material liability to Buyer or its Affiliates. Each International Benefit
Plan that is a Transferred Plan, if intended to qualify for special Tax
treatment or intended to be registered or qualified under applicable Law, to

respects to qualify for such intended favorable Tax treatment, and, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, is so registered or qualified, as applicable, in all
material respects, and if required to be funded, book-reserved or secured by
an insurance policy, is so funded, book-reserved or secured, based on

the International Benefit Plans for new entrants has been duly made and
validly effected in accordance with applicable Law.

(f) Except as described in Section 5.2(j) or Section 5.2(k) or as set forth in
Section 3.17(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the
Transactions shall not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional
or subsequent events or the passage of time) (i) entitle any Entity Employee
of any Conveyed Entity to any severance pay or any other payment, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such Entity Employee for which Buyer or a Conveyed Entity
may be responsible, (iii) result in forgiveness of indebtedness with respect
to any Entity Employee, or trigger any funding obligation under any Employee
Plan, or (iv) result in any limitation or restriction on the right of any
Seller or any Conveyed Entity to amend, merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Employee Plan or related trust.

defined in Section 280G of the Code.

the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.2(a) shall require Buyer or
the Conveyed Entities to maintain the employment of any specific Continued
Employee for any period of time after the Closing.

(b) Service Credit. Periods of employment with the Conveyed Entities or any of
their current or former Affiliates prior to the Closing, to the extent

Affiliate of Buyer to the Continued Employees, including vacation or personal
leave plans or arrangements, 401(k) or similar defined contribution retirement
plans, and any severance or welfare plans; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall require taking into account service for the purposes of any plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA, any frozen or grandfathered Employee Plan, or
any plan, program or policy providing retiree health or life benefits, or to
the extent that such credit would result in the duplication of any benefits
for the same period of service.

Continued Employees and their eligible dependents with all payments credited
against any out-of-pocket maximum, and with any expenses incurred and credited
against any deductible, under any group health plan of the Sellers or their
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date during the plan year in which the Closing
occurs, for purposes of determining the extent to which any such person has
satisfied his or her deductible or reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any
group health plan of Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer for such year; and; and (iii) if Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer sponsors a flexible
spending arrangement ("FSA") for the benefit of Continued Employees, credit
each participating Continued Employee's account under such FSA of Buyer or an
Affiliate with contributions made to such employee's FSA under any Seller's
Plan (less reimbursement payments) during the plan year in which the Closing
occurs in a manner that complies with applicable Law; provided that if Buyer
provides credit to participating Continued Employee under such FSA, the
Sellers shall reconcile underspent and overspent flexible spending accounts of
Continued Employees in its flexible spending arrangement(s) immediately prior
to Closing and transfer to Buyer the net amount, along with a breakdown by
Continued Employee of the reconciliation.

enable Buyer and the Conveyed Entities to assume or retain and honor the
Transferred Plans. Buyer and the Conveyed Entities shall be solely responsible
for all liabilities relating to the amendment or termination of any

Transferred Plan in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and

its Affiliates in which the Continued Employees are eligible to participate
following the Closing to accept rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) from the
Sellers' 401(k) plans excluding any loans.

(g) Consultation with Employee Representative Bodies. Sellers shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to undertake all legally required provision of
information to, or consultations, discussions or negotiations with, employee
representative bodies (including any unions or works councils) which represent
Continued Employees.

(h) Personnel.

(i) Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall effect the transfer of
employment of the Non-Business Entity Employees (collectively, the "Retained
Personnel") to any Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Conveyed
Entities); provided, however, that to the extent that any Retained Personnel
cannot be transferred from a Conveyed Entity to any Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Conveyed Entities) prior to the Closing Date for
any reason, Seller shall fully reimburse the Conveyed Entities on demand, and
shall fully indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and the Conveyed Entities, for
and against any and all costs (including without limitation, compensation,
salary, wages, health and welfare benefits, severance, penalties, legal fees
and any other costs) associated with (x) continuing to employ such Retained
Personnel following the Closing, including, to the extent applicable, any notice period
for such Retained Personnel, and (y) terminating the employment of the
Retained Personnel. For the avoidance of doubt, none of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates shall have any liability relating to the Retained Personnel.

(ii) Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall effect the transfer of
employment of each Business Entity Employee from any Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Conveyed Entities) to a Conveyed Entity.

(i) Payment of Transaction Bonus Obligations. Prior to the Closing, the
Sellers shall pay, or shall cause their Affiliates (other than the Conveyed
Entities) to pay, the amount of any transaction related bonuses owed to any
Continuing Employees in connection with the consummation of the Transactions,
together with the employer portion of any payroll, employment, social security
or other Taxes payable in connection therewith.

(j) Other than in relation to Save-As-You-Earn Plans and Share Incentive Plans
under Schedules 2 and 3 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 in
relation to which no Tax liability or reporting obligation arises to a
Conveyed Entity, respectively, the Sellers undertake to:

(i) inform Buyer of the vesting, exercise, or other event relevant for Tax
purposes (as applicable) of any Share Awards and to provide, in a timely
manner, details of the Share Awards and relevant event so that Buyer or
Conveyed Entity can make any applicable withholdings for any Tax and pay any
Tax to the relevant Taxing Authority within the applicable timescale;

(ii) procure that Buyer or the Conveyed Entities receive (before the due date
for payment of such amounts to the relevant Taxing Authority) an amount equal
to the amount of Tax that the Conveyed Entities are required to withhold and
pay to any relevant Taxing Authority (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
any employer's social security liabilities) in connection with the relevant
event (as appropriate), provided that Buyer agrees to provide to the Sellers
details of any withholding rates that are applicable to the holders of such
Awards in advance and (in the absence of such a notification) the Sellers can
assume that the withholding rates applicable at the time of Closing may apply;
and

(iii) provide to Buyer such other information as Buyer shall reasonably
request for the purposes of filing or complying with any reporting obligation
related to the Share Awards.

(k) Other than in relation to Save-As-You-Earns Plans and Share Incentive
Plans under Schedules 2 and 3 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act
2003 respectively, and without prejudice to the obligations of the Sellers
under Section 5.13(a)(i), Buyer shall have all the withholding and reporting
obligations (including annual reporting obligations) and liability to pay or
account for any Tax in relation to any vesting or exercise of Share Awards. Without limitation, Buyer shall, and shall cause any Affiliate which employs
or employed the relevant employee of the Conveyed Entity, to:

(i) pay over to the appropriate Taxing Authority the amount of any Tax that is
required to be accounted to such Taxing Authority and remit back to the
employee any excess amounts that are not required to be withheld;

(ii) pay to the appropriate Taxing Authority an amount equal to the employer
social security contributions before the date on which the employer social
security contributions must be accounted for to such Taxing Authority; and

(iii) unless specifically agreed otherwise with the Sellers in writing, be
responsible for reporting to the appropriate Taxing Authority the taxable
event that has occurred in connection with the Share Awards.

Section 5.3 Publicity. The Sellers and Buyer agree to communicate and
cooperate with each other prior to any public disclosure of the Transactions.
The Sellers and Buyer agree that no public release, filing, notification,
announcement or other communication (including Governmental Filings)
concerning or describing the Transactions or the financial or other effects of
such transactions shall be issued, released, filed, disseminated or published
by any Party or its Affiliates without the prior consent of the other Party,
except (a) as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules
and regulations of any stock exchange (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the London Stock Exchange and NASDAQ) upon which the securities of the Sellers
or Buyer, as applicable, or any of their respective Affiliates, are listed,
and in the event such disclosure is required, a Party may include such
information as it customarily discloses with respect to similar transactions;
and (b) as may be necessary or desirable in connection with any Governmental
Filings. Each Party shall, to the extent practicable and legally permissible,
allow the other Party reasonable time to review and comment on all public
releases, filings, notifications, announcements or other communications
(including Governmental Filings) concerning the Transactions in advance of
their issuance, release, filing, dissemination or publication.

Section 5.4 Confidentiality, Access.

(a) The Parties hereby agree to treat the contents of this Agreement, all
nonpublic information obtained in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions as confidential in accordance with the terms of that certain
Confidentiality Agreement between Cobham and Buyer, dated as of September 20,
2017 (the "Confidentiality Agreement") which shall continue in full force and
effect until the Closing Date, at which time the Confidentiality Agreement,
and the obligations of the Parties under this Section 5.4, shall terminate and
be of no further force or effect. If this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. The foregoing and the
Confidentiality Agreement shall not prevent a Party from making any disclosure
(x) as may be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock
exchange (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the London Stock Exchange and
NASDAQ) upon which the securities of the Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, or
any of their respective Affiliates, are listed, and in the event such disclosure is required, a Party may include such
information as it customarily discloses with respect to similar transactions;
and (y) as may be necessary or desirable in connection with any Governmental
Filings. For the avoidance of doubt, the non-solicitation provision set forth
in the Confidentiality Agreement shall not prevent Buyer from having
discussions prior to Closing with respect to the Entity Employees solely
regarding their roles with Buyer and the Conveyed Entities after the Closing.

(b) Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 5.4(a), from the date
hereof until the Closing, or such earlier date on which this Agreement may be
terminated in accordance with its terms, upon reasonable notice, the Sellers
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (including the Conveyed
Entities) and each of its and their respective representatives to: (i) afford
Buyer and its authorized representatives reasonable access to the officers,
personnel, properties, Contracts, and Business Records of the Conveyed
Entities and (ii) furnish to the authorized representatives of Buyer such
additional financial and operating data and other information regarding the
Conveyed Entities and their respective businesses and operations as Buyer and
its authorized representatives may from time to time reasonably request;
provided, however, that and such access shall be during normal business hours
and in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal
operations of Conveyed Entities. All requests by Buyer for access pursuant to
this Section 5.4(b) shall be submitted or directed to the individuals
specified in Section 5.4(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or, in each
case, such other individuals as the Sellers may designate in writing from time
to time. For the avoidance of doubt, prior to the Closing, Buyer shall have no
right to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the Real Property.

Section 5.5 Information.

(a) The Sellers and their respective Affiliates (other than the Conveyed
Entities) shall transfer to the Conveyed Entities the original copies of all
books, records, documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings,
evidence of title and other papers relating to the Conveyed Entities.

(b) Subject to Section 5.13, each Party shall retain the books, records,
documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings, evidence of title
and other papers relating to the Conveyed Entities with respect to the period
prior to the Closing in its possession for at least seven (7) years following
the Closing Date or such longer period as may be required by Law or applicable
court order. After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Buyer shall
furnish or cause to be furnished to the Sellers, and the Sellers shall furnish
or cause to be furnished to Buyer, access, during normal business hours, to
such information and assistance relating to the Conveyed Entities as is
reasonably necessary for insurance matters, financial reporting and accounting
matters, the preparation and filing of any Tax Return, the defense of any Tax
claim or assessment, in connection with any disclosure obligation or the
defense of any Action. The Sellers shall reimburse Buyer and Buyer shall
reimburse the Sellers for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
in assisting the Sellers or Buyer, as applicable, pursuant to this Section
5.5(b). (c) From the date hereof until the Closing, the Sellers shall, and shall cause
the Conveyed Entities to, cooperate with Buyer such that, immediately
following the Closing, the Conveyed Entities shall be able to timely satisfy
the following deliveries to Buyer.

(i) within fifteen (15) days after each calendar month, the U.S. Conveyed
Entity and the other Conveyed Entities shall provide Buyer the management
financial information customarily prepared by the Conveyed Entities on a
monthly basis, in each case prepared in accordance with the accounting
policies, procedures and estimates as set forth in Annex B, consistent with
their respective past practice; and

(ii) within thirty five (35) days after each quarter (other than the quarter
ended December 31, 2017), the U.S. Conveyed Entity and the other Conveyed
Entities shall provide Buyer the management financial information customarily
prepared by the Conveyed Entities on a quarterly basis, in each case prepared
in accordance with the accounting policies, procedures and estimates as set
forth in Annex B, consistent with their respective past practice.

(d) Cobham and the Sellers firmly commit to cause to be prepared, in
consultation with Buyer, and delivered to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (London)
("PwC UK") and Buyer prior to the Closing draft unaudited 2017 "carve-out"
financial statements with respect to the Conveyed Entities described below
(the "2017 Financials") sufficient to permit PwC UK to initiate the audit
field work for an audit of the 2017 Financials conducted in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted auditing standards ("U.S. GAAS"). The 2017 Financials
shall consist of a balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 and related
statements of income, cash flows and changes in equity equivalent for the
twelve (12) month period then ended (and related notes thereto) shall be
prepared with respect to the Conveyed Entities on a combined basis in
accordance with International Financial Reporting as adopted by the
International Accounting Standards Board ("IFRS as adopted by IASB"). Buyer,
Sellers and Cobham shall each use reasonable best efforts to cause PwC UK to
conduct, and shall assist such auditors in conducting, an audit of the 2017
Financials in accordance with U.S. GAAS. To the extent requested by Buyer,
Cobham and Sellers shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) support Buyer in
connection with the preparation of pro forma financial statements required to
be filed by Buyer pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation S-X, (ii) to cause PwC
UK to provide any required consents to include and/or incorporate the audited
2017 Financials in future registration statements filed by Buyer or its
Affiliates and (iii) provide necessary "comfort letters" in connection with
future issuances or sales of securities of the Buyer or its Affiliates.

(e) In addition, if the Closing will occur after May 10, 2018, Sellers and
Cobham shall use reasonable best efforts to cause to be prepared in accordance
with IFRS as adopted by IASB, in consultation with Buyer, and delivered to
Buyer, within 40 days after Closing unaudited financial statements with
respect to the Conveyed Entities on a combined basis consisting of balance
sheets as of March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, and related statements of
income, cash flows and changes in equity for the three (3) month periods ended
March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 (and related notes thereto). (f) Buyer shall reimburse Cobham and the Sellers for reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by Cobham, Sellers and their Affiliates in
complying with Section 5.5(d) and Section 5.5(e). Buyer will, and will cause
its Affiliates, advisors, agents and representatives to, treat and hold as
confidential any information (financial or otherwise) regarding Sellers and
their Affiliates that is disclosed to, or developed or learned by, Buyer and
its Affiliates in connection herewith and will refrain from disclosing and
will not use any such information for any purpose other than in connection
with any filings with a Governmental Entity contemplated by Section 5.5(d) and
Section 5.5(e) or as necessary to comply with applicable Law or a requirement
of a Governmental Entity; provided, however, that the preceding sentence shall
not apply to Buyer's use or disclosure of any confidential information of the
Conveyed Entities after Closing.

Section 5.6 Filings and Authorizations.

(a) The Sellers and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
each other to determine whether any filings are required to be made with, or
consents, permits, authorizations, clearances (including any national security
clearances), waivers or approvals are required to be obtained from, any third
parties or Governmental Entities under any applicable Regulatory Law or any
Contract in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Transactions, and, wherever appropriate, request early
termination of any waiting periods under such Regulatory Laws. The Sellers, on
the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, promptly file or cause to be filed and obtain or
cause to be obtained all necessary Governmental Filings including, as
applicable, (i) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions within fifteen (15)
Business Days of the date of this Agreement, (ii) as promptly as practicable
any Governmental Filings required under Foreign Antitrust Laws and all
required Governmental Filings under Export Control Laws, and (iii) submissions
of additional information requested by any Governmental Entity. The costs of
all Governmental Filings shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers and
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Buyer's undertaking pursuant to this
Section 5.6, Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts and to take any
and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any Regulatory Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or any
other party so as to enable the Parties hereto to receive any approval under
any Regulatory Law at the earliest possible point in time and to close the
Transactions as promptly as possible, including proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any of its assets,
properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be
acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement as are required to be divested in
order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which
would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the Transactions. In addition, Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in
court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or
terminated, any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, stipulation, determination or award entered by or with any Governmental Entity
(whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the
consummation of the Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not be required to take any action, or agree
to any hold separate order, sale, divestiture or disposition or other
condition or limitation, in each case, that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, have, individually or in the aggregate, a Regulatory Material
Adverse Effect. A "Regulatory Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect to
actions, hold separate orders, sales, divestitures or dispositions or other
condition or limitation, whether relating to the businesses, assets or
operations of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or the Conveyed Entities, a
material adverse effect on a business, results, operations, EBITDA, or
financial condition of the size and scale of the Conveyed Entities, taken as a
whole.

(d) The Sellers shall give reasonably prompt notice to Buyer of receipt by any
Seller or any of its Affiliates of any written notice from any Person alleging
that any material consent, permit, authorization, clearance, waiver or
approval is or may be required in connection with the Transactions.

(e) The Sellers and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
each other to determine whether any enterprise income tax is payable to the
State Administration of Taxation in the People's Republic of China as a result
of the Transactions. Buyer agrees that it will not report the Transactions to
the State Administration of Taxation in the People's Republic of China without
prior written authorization from the Sellers (such authorization not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), specifying what information
Buyer is entitled to disclose.

Section 5.7 Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall and shall cause each Conveyed
Entity to take any necessary actions to ensure all rights to exculpation and
indemnification and all limitations on liability existing in favor of any
current or former officers or directors of the Conveyed Entities
(collectively, the "Business Indemnitees"), as provided in (i) the applicable
organizational documents of the Conveyed Entities in effect on the date hereof
or (ii) any agreement between a Business Indemnitee and any Conveyed Entity
providing for exculpation or indemnification by such Business Indemnitee in
effect on the Closing Date and made available to Buyer prior to the date
hereof, in each case, shall survive the consummation of the Transactions and
shall continue in full force and effect and be honored by the Conveyed
Entities after the Closing, except to the extent required by applicable Law,
for a period of six (6) years thereafter. Following the Closing for a period
of six (6) years thereafter, except to the extent required by applicable Law,
Buyer shall not permit any of the Conveyed Entities to take any action so as
to amend, modify, limit or repeal the provisions for indemnification of the
Business Indemnitees contained in the applicable organizational documents of
the Conveyed Entities in effect on the date hereof of any Conveyed Entity in
such a manner as would adversely affect the rights of any Business Indemnitee
to be exculpated or indemnified by such Persons in respect of their serving in
such capacities prior to the Closing. If any Action (whether arising before,
at or after the Closing) subject to the exculpation or indemnification rights
referred to above is made against any Business Indemnitees on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing,
the provisions of the prior sentences of this Section 5.7(a) shall continue in
effect until the final disposition of such Action.

(b) At or prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall, in consultation with Buyer,
cause the Conveyed Entities to purchase, a non-terminable extension of (or
equivalent insurance with respect to coverage, retentions, amounts and other
material terms to) the current directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy of the Conveyed Entities (the "DandO Insurance"). The DandO Insurance shall
(i) have an effective term of six years from the Closing, (ii) cover each
current director or officer currently covered by the applicable directors' and
officers' insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement for actions
and omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing, and (iii) contain terms
that are no less favorable than those of the applicable directors' and
officers' insurance policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided
that in any event the aggregate premium and policy limit for such DandO
Insurance shall be no higher than what is set forth in Section 5.7(b) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules. The costs of the DandO Insurance shall be borne
fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, this
Section 5.7 shall survive the consummation of the Transactions and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer. In the event that a Conveyed
Entity after the Closing or Buyer or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns or transferees of the properties or
assets of the Conveyed Entity or Buyer, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.

Section 5.8 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions herein provided, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
and without limiting the obligations of the Parties under Section 5.6, each of
the Parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause
to be taken all action, to do or cause to be done and to assist and cooperate
with the other Party in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions.

Section 5.9 No Modification of RandW Policy. The Parties acknowledge that, as of
the date hereof, Buyer has obtained a conditional binder to the RandW Policy,
and a true and complete copy of such conditional binder has been provided to
the Sellers. Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to, amend,
modify or otherwise change, terminate or waive any provision of the RandW
Policy, including the waiver of subrogation set forth therein, in any manner
that is adverse to the Sellers, without the prior written consent of Sellers,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 5.10 Termination of Agreements. (a) On and as of the Closing, except for those Contracts, if any, set forth in
Section 5.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and as otherwise requested
by Buyer, the Sellers shall terminate (or shall cause to be terminated) all
Related Party Arrangements (other than the Transition Services Agreement).

(b) Notwithstanding any limitations set forth in Section 5.1, the Sellers
shall eliminate as of the Closing (by way of capital contribution, cash
settlement or otherwise, in each case as mutually determined by each Seller
and Buyer) all inter-company accounts, whether payables or receivables,
between each Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Conveyed
Entities), on the one hand, and any Conveyed Entity, on the other hand, and,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, such payables and
receivables, and other receivables (including, without limitation, non-trade
receivables) in respect of that certain End License User Agreement and that
certain 2014 Business Model Addendum to End-User License Agreement Rev.
140201, dated April 30, 2014, between Mentor Graphics Corporation and Aeroflex
Incorporated, shall not be taken into account in calculating the Closing Date
Net Working Capital.

Section 5.11 Termination of Certain Support Services. Buyer acknowledges that
the Conveyed Entities currently receive from the Sellers and their Affiliates
certain administrative and corporate services and benefits of a type generally
provided to other businesses and Subsidiaries of the Sellers (the "Support
Services"). The Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that, except for Support
Services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, Support Services shall
cease at the Closing, and all agreements and arrangements (whether or not in
writing) in respect thereof shall terminate as of the Closing Date, with no
further obligation of any party thereto. The Parties agree that the
acknowledgments contained in this Section 5.11 shall not be interpreted as
limiting any of the representations and warranties made by the Sellers in this
Agreement, including without limitation the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.11.

Section 5.12 Intellectual Property Matters.

(a) Buyer acknowledges that, as between the Sellers and Buyer, the Sellers own
all Retained Marks, and Buyer has no rights, and is not acquiring any rights
to use the Retained Marks after the Closing Date, except as set forth in
Section 5.12(b). For purposes of this Section 5.12, "Aeroflex Marks" means
Trademarks consisting of or incorporating the terms "Aeroflex", and any names
(including internet Domain Names) or Trademarks related thereto or containing
or comprising the foregoing, including all contractions, abbreviations,
derivations, translations or transliterations of these names and Trademarks or
any names or Trademarks confusingly similar thereto, or likely to be
confusingly similar thereto, or dilutive thereof; and "Retained Marks" means,
collectively, the Aeroflex Marks, any Trademark consisting of or incorporating
the terms "Cobham," and any other Trademark (other than Trademarks owned by
the Conveyed Entities) used by the Sellers or any of their Affiliates or
former Affiliates (other than the Conveyed Entities), and any names (including
internet Domain Names) or Trademarks related thereto or containing or
comprising the foregoing, including all contractions, abbreviations,
derivations, translations or transliterations of these names and Trademarks or
any names or Trademarks confusingly similar thereto, or likely to be confusingly
similar thereto, or dilutive thereof.

(b) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Sellers hereby grant to Buyer and
its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Entities) (the "Licensees") for two (2)
years after the Closing Date (the "Trademark Term"), a worldwide, royalty-
free, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to use the Aeroflex Marks in
connection with the continued operation of the business of the Conveyed
Entities, including in connection with the manufacturing, promotion,
advertisement, sale, and distribution of products of the Conveyed Entities,
including any products of the Conveyed Entities existing as of the Closing
Date, as well as any new products developed by the Conveyed Entities after the
Closing Date. During the Trademark Term, the Licensees may also (i) utilize
the stock of sales, marketing, promotional, and other materials (including
stationary and invoices) and any products and packaging bearing the Retained
Marks and in existence or in production as of the Closing Date, and (ii)
develop new advertising and promotional materials bearing the Aeroflex Marks
in any medium in connection with the sale, distribution, promotion and
advertising of products of the Conveyed Entities, including brochures, media
commercials, copy materials, packaging materials, stationary, invoices, and
social media. Each Licensee may sublicense the rights granted in this Section
5.12(b) to its authorized distributors, vendors, subcontractors, and resellers
acting on behalf of that Licensee in connection with the operation of the
business of the Conveyed Entities. The foregoing license may be transferred in
whole or in part in connection with any sale or reorganization of the business
of the Conveyed Entities. Buyer shall ensure the Licensees use the Retained
Marks in a manner consistent with which, and in connection with goods and
services of a level of quality equal to or greater than the quality of goods
and services in connection with which, the Conveyed Entities used the Retained
Marks immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(c) At the conclusion of the Trademark Term, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Licensees, to remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all Retained Marks
from all assets and other materials under the control of the Conveyed
Entities, including any vehicles, business cards, schedules, stationery,
packaging materials, promotional materials, manuals, forms, websites, email,
computer software and other materials and systems, except that any inventory
in existence or in production as of the end of the Trademark Term that
contains any Retained Mark may be sold and otherwise distributed by the
Conveyed Entities or any of their Affiliates after the Trademark Term (without
removing, striking over or otherwise obliterating such Trademarks) until the
earlier of (i) the date such inventory is fully sold and distributed and (ii)
ninety (90) days after the expiration of the Trademark Term, and Buyer has no
obligation to remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate any Retained Mark
from any asset or material that has been distributed to the public.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.12, from and after
the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, make
clear in all correspondence, communications or other dissemination of
information containing Retained Marks and made by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates that the Conveyed Entities are no longer affiliated with the
Sellers or any of the Sellers' Affiliates.

(d) To the extent there exists any Intellectual Property (other than
Trademarks or Domain Names) owned by the Sellers or their Affiliates after the
Closing that was used or held for use by the Conveyed Entities as of or prior to the Closing, the Sellers
hereby grant, on behalf of themselves and their Affiliates, an irrevocable,
perpetual, non-exclusive, sublicensable license in, to and under such
Intellectual Property to the Conveyed Entities to continue using such
Intellectual Property in the manner it was used thereby prior to the Closing
and in natural evolutions of such use (which license may be transferred in
whole or in part in connection with any sale or reorganization of the business
of the Conveyed Entities).

(e) To the extent any of the Transferred Intellectual Property was used by the
Sellers and/or their Affiliates (other than the Conveyed Entities) ("Licensed
Parties") as of or prior to the Closing, Buyer hereby grants an irrevocable,
perpetual, non-exclusive, sublicensable license in, to and under the
Transferred Intellectual Property to the Sellers to continue using such
Intellectual Property in the manner it was used prior to the Closing by the
Licensed Parties and in natural evolutions of such use (which license may be
transferred in whole or in part in connection with any sale or reorganization
of the business of any of the Licensed Parties).

(f) The Sellers shall continue to own (and shall not otherwise assign,
transfer or dispose of) the Aeroflex Marks for the Trademark Term.

Section 5.13 Tax Matters.

(a) Liabilities for Taxes.

(i) The Sellers shall be liable for, pay (or cause to be paid) and indemnify
and hold harmless Buyer from and against (A) all Taxes imposed on the Conveyed
Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any contractual payment due

received in respect of Group Relief for such Pre-Closing Tax Periods) and the
Pre-Closing Share of any such Taxes for any Straddle Period, (B) all Taxes of
the Sellers, (C) Taxes for which any of the Conveyed Entities is or becomes
liable under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or under any similar

group for income Tax purposes before the Closing, (D) any VAT payable by any
Conveyed Entity, or recharge of any VAT payable by any other member of a
Sellers' VAT Group, attributable to any supplies, self-supplies, or
importations or acquisitions made or deemed to have been made for VAT purposes
by or to the Conveyed Entity concerned on or before the Closing Date or by or
to the members of the Sellers' VAT Group (other than, after the Closing Date,
any Conveyed Entity) on or prior to the date on which the Conveyed Entities
cease to be members of the Sellers' VAT Group and the deeming provisions of
Section 15 VATCA (or their equivalent under any other jurisdiction) shall be
disregarded in determining what supplies, self-supplies, or importations or
acquisitions have been made by or to any person for the purposes of this
Section 5.13(a)(i), (E) Transfer Taxes for which any Seller is responsible
pursuant to Section 5.13(h), (F) any liability of Buyer or any Conveyed
Entities to account for any income Tax or social security contributions,

exercise, surrender, exchange or other disposal of an option or other right to
acquire securities, or in respect of any acquisition, holding, variation or
disposal of securities where the acquisition of the security or the grant of the option, or other
right to acquire the relevant security occurred on or before the Closing,
excluding any liability to the extent that the Sellers have made a payment in
respect of that liability pursuant to Section 5.2(j)(ii), (G) any post-Closing
obligation of any Conveyed Entity to repay any amount in respect of any
payable research and development credit available or accruing prior to the
Closing, and (H) Taxes of Buyer arising by reason of Buyer having failed to
make a deduction pursuant to the provisions of Section 980 TCA (collectively,
"Seller Taxes").

(ii) Buyer shall be liable for, pay and indemnify and hold the Seller
Indemnitees harmless from and against (A) all Taxes imposed on the Conveyed
Entities for any Post-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Share of any
such Taxes for any Straddle Period and (B) Transfer Taxes for which Buyer is
responsible pursuant to Section 5.13(h) (collectively, "Buyer Taxes").

(b) Tax Returns.

(i) The Sellers shall (x) prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and
timely filed) any combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes
any Seller, on the one hand, and any Conveyed Entity, on the other hand (a
"Combined Tax Return") and (y) prepare (or caused to be prepared) any income
Tax Return (other than any Combined Tax Return) that is required to be filed
by or with respect to the U.S. Conveyed Entity for any taxable period that
ends on or before the Closing Date. The Sellers shall be responsible for all
Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns except to the extent such Taxes were
included in the Closing Date Current Tax Amount, as finally determined.

(ii) Buyer shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely
filed) when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Conveyed
Entities after the Closing Date (including Tax Returns relating to a Straddle
Period) other than the Tax returns described in Section 5.13(b)(i), and Buyer
shall remit or cause to be remitted to the applicable Taxing Authorities by
the applicable due date (giving effect to valid extensions) any Taxes shown to
be due in respect of such Tax Returns. The Sellers shall be responsible for
and shall, no later than three (3) days prior to the due date of each such Tax
Return, pay to Buyer the amount of Seller Taxes shown as due on such Tax
Return.

(iii) With respect to Tax Returns to be filed by the Sellers pursuant to
Section 5.13(b)(i), or Buyer pursuant to Section 5.13(b)(i) that relate to a
Straddle Period, (x) such Tax Returns shall be filed in a manner consistent
with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law and except
in respect of Group Relief and (y) the party responsible for preparing such
Tax Returns (the "Preparing Party") shall submit each such Tax Return (other
than a Combined Tax Return) to the party not responsible for preparing such
Tax Return (the "Reviewing Party") not later than thirty (30) days prior to
the due date for filing such Tax Return (giving effect to valid extensions)
(or, if such due date is within 30 days following the Closing Date, as
promptly as practicable following the Closing Date) for review and comment by
the Reviewing Party. If the Reviewing Party objects to such Tax Return presented by the Preparing Party,
the Reviewing Party shall notify the Preparing Party of such disputed items
and the basis for its objection within ten (10) days of the day of receipt of
such Tax Return, and Buyer and the Sellers shall act in good faith to resolve
any such dispute. If within ten (10) days of the Reviewing Party's delivery of
a notice of objection the Parties have not reached an agreement regarding such
Tax Return, the dispute shall be presented to a mutually acceptable nationally
recognized firm of independent chartered accountants that has not provided
material services to any Seller or Buyer or their respective Affiliates in the
preceding three years, who shall resolve any dispute for the Tax Return and
whose determination shall be final and binding on both Parties and may be
entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction, provided, that nothing
herein shall prevent Buyer from timely filing such Tax Returns. Buyer shall
promptly amend (or cause to be amended) the relevant Tax Return to reflect the
determination of the independent chartered accountants and shall file (or
cause to be filed) such Tax Return. The fees and expenses of the independent
charted accountants shall be borne equally by Buyer and the Sellers.

(iv) Except as required by applicable Law, neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall amend, re-file or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of
any statute of limitations with respect to) any Tax Return relating, in whole
or in part, to a Conveyed Entity with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
or Post-Closing Tax Period which has the effect of moving losses from Pre-
Closing Tax Periods to Post-Closing Tax periods, without the prior written
consent of such Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(v) Notwithstanding Section 5.13(b)(i), the Sellers shall prepare and timely
file (whether as part of a group filing or otherwise) any certificate due in
accordance with Schedule 46 of the United Kingdom's Finance Act 2009 in
respect of any financial year of the UK Conveyed Entity ending prior to
Closing (to the extent not filed prior to Closing). The Sellers shall provide
a copy of any such certificate to Buyer on or before the due date for filing.

(c) Refunds and Credits.

(i) Any Tax refund or credit in lieu of a refund (including interest received
from the applicable Taxing Authority thereon) received by or credited to Buyer
or any of its Affiliates of Taxes paid by the Sellers (including Taxes taken
into account as a reduction to the purchase price hereunder) shall be paid to
the Sellers within ten (10) days after the receipt of such Tax refund or
filing of the Tax Return claiming such credit, provided, however, that the
amount of any such refund that Buyer is required to pay to the Sellers shall
be net of any Taxes imposed on the receipt of, and any reasonable expenses
incurred to obtain, such refund. To the extent that Buyer or its Affiliates
are required to repay to the applicable Taxing Authority any refund described
in this Section 5.13(c) for which Buyer or its Affiliates made a payment to
the Sellers pursuant to this Section 5.13(c), the Sellers and their Affiliates
shall promptly repay to Buyer an amount equal to any such payment. (ii) For purposes of this Section 5.13(c), where it is necessary to apportion
a refund or credit between the Sellers and Buyer for a Straddle Period, the
Sellers shall be entitled to the Pre-Closing Share of such refund or credit
and Buyer shall be entitled to the Post-Closing Share of such refund or
credit.

(iii) (iii) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Sellers in obtaining as soon as possible
any refund or credit in lieu of a refund to which Sellers are entitled under
this Section 5.13(c).

(d) Contests.

(i) Buyer and the Sellers shall promptly notify the other Party in writing
upon receipt of written notice of any pending or threatened audit, notice of
deficiency, examination, assessment or any other administrative proceeding or
court proceedings ("Audit") which may affect any Tax liability for which the
other Party is liable pursuant to this Section 5.13.

(ii) The Sellers shall have the right to (A) represent the interests of the
applicable Conveyed Entity in any Audit relating to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period; (B) employ counsel of its choice in connection therewith; and (C)
settle any Audit relating to Taxes of the Conveyed Entity for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period, provided, however, that (x) Buyer shall have the right to
participate in any such Audit and (y) the Sellers shall not settle or
compromise any such Audit without the prior written consent of Buyer, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Sellers
and Buyer shall jointly control and conduct any Audit in respect of a Conveyed
Entity with respect to a Straddle Period, and any settlement or compromise
with respect to a Straddle Period shall require the prior written consent of
the Sellers and the Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
conditioned.

Affiliate of any Seller under a group payment arrangement made pursuant to section 59F of the United Kingdom Taxes
Management Act 1970 ("G.P.A.");

(2) procure that there shall be (subject to sub-clause (3) below) promptly
apportioned to the relevant Conveyed Entity an amount equal to each U.K. Tax
Payment, such apportionment to be made by reference to the payment of United
Kingdom corporation tax in respect of which the U.K. Tax Payment was paid;

(3) not without Buyer's written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), reapportion any amount previously apportioned to a Conveyed Entity
pursuant to the G.P.A.;

(4) promptly (and in any case within five (5) Business Days of receipt thereof
from a Taxing Authority) pay, or procure that there is paid, to Conveyed
Entity an amount equal to any excess by which the amount or the aggregate
amount of any U.K. Tax Payments exceeds the amount of Tax for which the
relevant Conveyed Entity is actually liable for the taxable period in respect
of which the U.K. Tax Payments are made, together with interest on the excess
at the rate applicable from time to time to Tax overpaid for the period from
the date of the relevant U.K. Tax Payments to the date of payment pursuant to
this paragraph (4), and whether or not any payment has actually been made to
H.M.R.C. in respect of such U.K. Tax Payment.

(iii) The Sellers' VAT Group.

(1) The Sellers will, on or before Closing, give notice to H.M.R.C. (copying
the notice to Buyer) that the UK Conveyed Entity will come under the control
of Buyer with effect from Closing and will use commercially reasonable efforts
to procure that the date on which the UK Conveyed Entity ceases to be a member
of the Sellers' VAT Group, falls on the Closing Date.

(2) Buyer will use reasonable efforts to procure that the UK Conveyed Entity
provides to the representative member of the Sellers' VAT Group all
information relating to the UK Conveyed Entity required to prepare the VAT
return of the Sellers' VAT Group for any period that the UK Conveyed Entity
has been a member of that VAT Group at least ten Business Days before the last
date for submission of that return.

(3) Notwithstanding Section 5.13(e)(i), Buyer will procure that the UK
Conveyed Entity contribute to the representative member of the Sellers' VAT
Group that proportion of any VAT for which the representative member of the
Sellers' VAT Group is accountable that is properly attributable to supplies,
acquisitions and importations ("Supplies") made before Closing by the Sellers' VAT Group through the UK Conveyed Entity (after
deduction of any amounts previously paid in respect thereof, and less any
amount of deductible input tax incurred by the UK Conveyed Entity) provided
that the computation of Closing Date Net Working Capital makes provision for
that VAT.

(4) Any contribution made under Section 5.13(e)(iii)(3) shall be made in
cleared funds the later of ten Business Days after demand is made for it and
ten Business Days before the day on which the representative member must
account for that VAT to H.M.R.C.

(5) The Sellers shall pay, or shall procure to be paid, to the UK Conveyed
Entity an amount equivalent to the proportion of any repayment of VAT received
by the representative member from H.M.R.C. or of any credit obtained by
reference to an excess of deductible input tax over output tax (and any
applicable repayment supplement or interest) that is attributable to Supplies
made or received, or deemed to be made or received, by the Sellers' VAT Group
though the UK Conveyed Entity while a member of the Sellers' VAT Group within
ten Business Days of receipt by, or offset against a liability of, the
representative member.

(6) The UK Conveyed Entity shall make no contribution, under this Section
5.13(e)(iii), to the extent that it relates to an amount for which the Sellers
are liable to Buyer under this Agreement (disregarding any limitations on
claims imposed by Section 8.5).

(7) The Sellers shall procure that an amount equal to any payment made by
Buyer under this Section 5.13(e)(iii) shall be promptly and duly accounted for
to H.M.R.C.

(iv) The Sellers shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, deliver or cause to
be delivered to Buyer evidence, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, of
the matters set out in sub-clause (i) above.

cause its respective Affiliates) to cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns of any Conveyed Entity and any Audit with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Party's request)
the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to any such Audit
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder at
the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party. The Sellers and Buyer shall
(i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Conveyed Entities relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any Straddle
Period until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority; and (ii)
give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so requests, shall allow the requesting Party,
at its sole expense, to take possession of such books and records.

(g) 338 Elections. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer
shall be permitted to make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code (a
"338(g) Election") with respect to the acquisition of any Conveyed Entity that

corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, without obtaining the
Sellers' prior written consent; provided, however, that Buyer will indemnify
and hold harmless Sellers for any Taxes to the extent set forth on Section

being understood that Buyer shall not be liable for any Taxes incurred by
Seller as a result of making the 338(h)(10) election.

(h) Transfer Taxes. Any Transfer Taxes shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by
the Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer. The Party required by Law to do
so will file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable Law, the other Parties
will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such
Tax Returns and other documentation. If the Law does not provide which Party
is required to file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to the Transfer Taxes, then Buyer will be required to file those Tax
Returns and other documentation, and the Sellers shall provide reasonable
cooperation to Buyer with respect to such filing.

(i) Exclusivity. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.13, after the
Closing, all issues relating to Tax matters shall be governed solely by the
provisions of this Section 5.13 except for the applicable provisions of
Article VIII hereof.

Section 5.14 Insurance Matters. Buyer acknowledges that except for those
policies set forth in Section 5.14 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the
policies and insurance coverage maintained on behalf of the Conveyed Entities
are part of the corporate insurance program maintained by the Sellers and
certain of their Affiliates (such policies, the "Insurance Policies"), and
such coverage will not be transferred to Buyer or to a Conveyed Entity. It is
understood that each Seller and its Affiliates shall be free at its discretion
at any time following the Closing to cancel or not renew any of the Insurance
Policies. Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, promptly notify the relevant insurance carriers of any material
claims relating to the Conveyed Entities arising under any of the Insurance
Policies and shall ensure that the net proceeds realized or recovered from any
of the Insurance Policies with respect to such claims are contributed to the
Conveyed Entities. At and following the Closing, the Sellers shall, or shall
cause their Affiliates to, pay to Buyer any proceeds of the Insurance Policies
to the extent in respect of claims relating to the Conveyed Entities. Any
proceeds received by the Conveyed Entities or Buyer pursuant to this Section
5.14 shall be disregarded for purposes of calculating the Closing
Consideration Amount and any adjustment thereto.

Section 5.15 Transfer of Assets; Wrong Pockets; Consents. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers
shall be permitted to transfer from the Conveyed Entities, at any time and at
their own cost, those assets or Intellectual Property rights, and only those
assets or rights which are described in Section 5.15(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to assign, transfer, convey and deliver to a Conveyed
Entity (as designated by Buyer) free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances) and pursuant to conveyance documentation reasonably
acceptable to Buyer, all of their respective right, title and interest in and
to any Transferred Intellectual Property or any other assets, Contracts or
rights of any of the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates (other than
any Conveyed Entity) that are used or held for use primarily in the business
of any of the Conveyed Entities (each, an "Omitted Asset"), For the avoidance
of doubt, "Omitted Assets" shall not include any assets, Contracts or rights
(i) which are described in Section 5.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
(ii) used in connection with the provision of services pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement or (iii) to be licensed pursuant to Section
5.12. In the event that any consent to assignment in respect of any
Transferred Intellectual Property or other Omitted Asset is not obtained prior
to the Closing, then, pending such consent and subsequent assignment, the
Sellers shall cause the applicable Seller (or its Affiliate) to provide to
Buyer all of the rights and interests in and to any such Transferred
Intellectual Property or other Omitted Asset to the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law until such time that such consent is obtained and such
Transferred Intellectual Property or other Omitted Asset is assigned to a
Conveyed Entity.

Date, Buyer or any of the Sellers discover that the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates holds any Transferred Intellectual Property or other
Omitted Assets the Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
promptly assign, transfer, convey and deliver all right, title and interest in
such Transferred Intellectual Property or other Omitted Asset to Buyer or a
Conveyed Entity or another Affiliate of Buyer, as designated by Buyer.

and provide updates in respect of the status of consents, waivers or approvals
required in connection with the assignment or transfer of, or any change of
control matters relating to, any Transferred Intellectual Property, any
Omitted Assets and any Contracts to which a Seller or its Affiliates
(including the Conveyed Entities) is a party; provided, that no Seller shall,
or shall permit any of its Affiliates (including the Conveyed Entities) to,
pay, agree to pay or offer any consideration or similar payment or grant or
offer to grant other accommodation to any Person, by or on behalf of any
Conveyed Entity, in connection with obtaining any such consents, waivers or
approvals, without the prior written consent of Buyer. Buyer shall pay all
amounts payable in accordance with this Section 5.15(d) in connection with
obtaining any consents, waivers or approvals pursuant to this Section 5.15(d)
(the "Buyer Consent Expenses").

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fourth
(4th) anniversary of the Closing Date, the Sellers and Cobham shall not, and
shall cause Cobham plc and its and their respective Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, engage in the Restricted Business anywhere in the
world or have any interest (financial or otherwise) in, or serve in any
capacity of control with, any Person (other than Buyer or the Conveyed
Entities) engaged in the Restricted Business anywhere in the world.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in
Section 5.17(a) will:

(i) Prohibit or restrict the ownership by Cobham, any Seller, Cobham plc or
any of their respective Affiliates, solely for investment purposes, of less
than five percent (5%) of the equity securities of a publicly traded entity
that engages in the Restricted Business as long as none of Cobham, any Seller
nor any of their respective Affiliates is a controlling Person or a member of
a group that controls such Person; or

(ii) Prohibit or restrict Cobham, any Seller, Cobham plc or any of their
respective Affiliates from acquiring Equity Securities in or assets of a
Person (an "Acquired Person") engaged in the Restricted Business if the gross
revenues of such Acquired Person from the Restricted Business in the 12 months
prior to the consummation of such acquisition do not exceed fifteen percent
(15%) of the total net revenues of the Acquired Person during such period.

(c) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fourth
(4th) anniversary of the Closing Date, Cobham and the Sellers shall not, and
shall cause Cobham plc and its and their respective Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, solicit, recruit or hire any person who is a
Restricted Employee; provided, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) a
general solicitation to the public by general advertising or similar methods
of solicitation by search firms not specifically directed at Restricted
Employees or (ii) Cobham, any Seller, Cobham plc or any of their respective
Affiliates from soliciting, recruiting or hiring any Restricted Employee who

their respective Affiliates for at least 12 months. For purposes of this
Section 5.17(c), "Restricted Employees" means, collectively, any of the
officers or employees of a Conveyed Entity as of the date hereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, Restricted Employees shall include any individual listed
on Annex A of the Transition Services Agreement but shall exclude any
individual listed on Annex B of the Transition Services Agreement. (d) From and after the Closing, each of Cobham and each Seller shall not and
shall cause Cobham plc and its and their Affiliates, and its and their
Affiliates' respective representatives not to, use for its or their own
benefit or divulge or convey to any third party, any Confidential Information;
provided, however, that, Cobham, a Seller, Cobham plc or any of their
respective Affiliates may furnish such portion (and only such portion) of the
Confidential Information as Cobham, such Seller, Cobham plc or such Affiliate
reasonably determines it is legally obligated to disclose if (i) it receives a
request to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information under the
terms of a subpoena, civil investigative demand or order issued by a
Governmental Entity, (ii) to the extent not inconsistent with such request, it
notifies Buyer of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such
request and consults with Buyer on the advisability of taking steps available
under applicable Law to resist or narrow such request, (iii) it exercises its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an order or other reliable assurance

purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" consists of all
information and data relating to the business or operations of the Conveyed
Entities (other than data or information that is or becomes available to the
public other than as a result of a breach of this Section 5.17(d)).

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the covenants in this Section 5.17 will not

or such Seller immediately prior to the consummation of such merger,
consolidation or other transaction or series of related transactions cease to
hold more than 50% of the combined voting power of the surviving or resulting
entity outstanding immediately after such merger, consolidation or other
transaction or series of related transactions; or (ii) acquires by sale,
lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of
transactions) of all or substantially all of the assets of Cobham plc, Cobham
or any Seller.

(f) Cobham and the Sellers agree that the terms and provisions of this Section
5.17 (the "Restrictive Covenants") are an essential element of this Agreement
and any breach or threatened breach of any term or provision of the Restricted
Covenants shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer and its Affiliates and that
money damages shall not provide an adequate remedy to Buyer or its Affiliates.
Buyer shall have the right to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
the Restrictive Covenants in any court of competent jurisdiction, and in each
case without posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of Cobham
and the Sellers agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to enforce the terms and
provisions of Restricted Covenant on the basis that the other Buyer or any of
its Affiliates have an adequate remedy at law. Cobham and each Seller has
independently consulted with its counsel and after such consultation agrees
that the covenants set forth in this Section 5.17 are reasonable and proper to
protect the legitimate interest of Buyer and its Affiliates. (g) If any court determines that any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any part
thereof, is invalid or unenforceable, then the remainder of the Restrictive
Covenants shall not thereby be affected and shall be given full effect without
regard to the invalid portions. If any court determines that any of the
Restrictive Covenants, or any part thereof, are unenforceable because of the
duration or geographic scope of such provision, such court shall have the
power to reduce the duration or scope of such provision to the maximum
duration or scope permitted by applicable Law, as the case may be, and, in its
reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable.

Section 5.18 Further Assurances. Each Party shall cooperate with the other,
and promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all
such other instruments, including, without limitation, instruments of
conveyance, assignment and transfer, and take all such other actions as may
reasonably be requested by the other Party hereto from time to time,
consistent with the terms of this Agreement, in order to effectuate the
provisions and purposes of this Agreement.

Section 5.19 Retained Litigation. Buyer and the Sellers acknowledge and agree
that the U.S. Conveyed Entity shall retain from and after Closing all rights
to pursue in the name of the U.S. Conveyed Entity that certain litigation
pending in Case No. 2009-CV-1141 in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court,
Sedgwick County, Kansas, Civil Department (the "Retained Litigation"),
including the sole and exclusive right to control the prosecution of the
Retained Litigation. Sellers shall cause the U.S. Conveyed Entity to prosecute
the Retained Litigation prior to Closing in good faith and shall not take any
material action or any material position with respect thereto without the
prior written consent of Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

Section 5.20 Payoff Indebtedness; Transaction Expenses Payoff Instructions.
The Sellers shall negotiate Debt Payoff Letters for all Payoff Indebtedness.
The Sellers shall, and shall cause the Conveyed Entities to, deliver all
notices and take all other actions reasonably requested by Buyer to facilitate
the termination of all Contracts relating to Payoff Indebtedness, the

Person; and

(e) Any Buyer Consent Expenses to the extent such Buyer Consent Expenses are
required to be, and are not, paid by Buyer pursuant to Section 5.15(d).

Section 8.4 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) If a Party hereto seeks to make a claim for indemnification hereunder (an
"Indemnified Claim"), other than in respect of a Third-Party Claim, the Party
entitled to indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall notify the Party
required to provide indemnity hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing
of such Indemnified Claim (a "Direct Claim Notice"), prior to the expiration
of the survival period for the provision or obligation forming the basis
thereof, specifying in reasonable detail the factual basis of such claim,
stating the amount of Losses (or if not known, a good faith estimate of the
amount of Losses), containing a reference to the provision of this Agreement
in respect of which such Indemnified Claim arises and demanding
indemnification therefor. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the
Indemnified Party in writing within ten (10) days following receipt of a
Direct Claim Notice that it disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party
hereunder, such Indemnified Claim specified by the Indemnified Party in the
Direct Claim Notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party hereunder and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount
of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article VIII. If the Indemnifying Party agrees
that it has an indemnification obligation, but asserts that it is obligated to
pay a lesser amount than that claimed by the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall pay such lesser amount promptly to the Indemnified
Party, without prejudice to or waiver of the Indemnified Party's claim for the difference, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article VIII.

(b) In the event that any claim is asserted in writing or any Action is
commenced or threatened in writing by a third party involving a claim for
which an Indemnifying Party may be liable to an Indemnified Party (a "Third-
Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall give written notice to the
Indemnifying Party promptly (and in any event within 30 days) after the
Indemnified Party receives written notification of such Third-Party Claim,
specifying in reasonable detail the factual basis of such Third-Party Claim
(together with a copy of all material pleadings to date in respect thereof),
stating the amount of Losses (if known), containing a reference to the
provision of this Agreement in respect of which such Indemnified Claim arises
and demanding indemnification therefor. The failure of an Indemnified Party to
provide notice in accordance with the prior sentence shall not constitute a
waiver of that Party's rights to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement,
except to the extent that any such failure or delay materially prejudices the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have fifteen (15) days from
its receipt of notice in respect of a Third-Party Claim to notify the
Indemnified Party whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires, by counsel of
its own choosing and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to
defend against such Third-Party Claim, but only if the Indemnifying Party
undertakes to indemnify the Indemnified Party for such matter, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article VIII. If the Indemnifying Party
undertakes to defend against such Third-Party Claim (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall diligently defend and protect the interests of the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Third-Party Claim and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to
any settlement, compromise or judgment, unless the settlement, compromise or
judgment (A) relates solely to monetary damages for which the Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 for the
full amount of such monetary damages and (B) includes, as an unconditional
term thereof, the full release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in
respect of such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any
event, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to engage separate counsel
and to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim which the
Indemnifying Party shall have undertaken to defend, but the fees and expenses
of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, unless (1)
the engagement of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in
writing by the Indemnifying Party, (2) the named parties to the Third-Party
Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that
representation by counsel to the Indemnifying Party of both the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party may present such counsel with a conflict of
interest or (3) the Indemnifying Party fails to diligently defend such Third-
Party Claim within ten (10) days after receiving notice of such failure from
the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to defend against any
Third-Party Claim, but rather the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
assume and control such defense, if the Indemnified Party is entitled to be
indemnified against such Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section
8.3 and (i) such Third-Party Claim seeks non-monetary, equitable, or
injunctive relief, or would otherwise impose criminal liability or damages or
(ii), in the case where the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnitee, (A) the
amount sought with respect to such Third-Party Claim is subject to and exceeds
the Indemnification Limit, the Liability Limit or the Aggregate Liability Limit, as applicable, (B) such
Third-Party Claim involves a material customer or a material supplier of Buyer
(or any of its Affiliates), (C) Buyer reasonably determines that the Third-
Party Claim poses a significant legal, regulatory or reputational risk to
Buyer or to any of its Affiliates, (D) such Third-Party Claim involves an
Action in which the third party is a Governmental Entity or (E) such Third-
Party Claim is covered by the RandW Policy and the Losses arising from or
related to such Third-Party Claim are (or are reasonably likely to be) in
excess of retention under the RandW Policy.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not undertake to defend against such Third-
Party Claim within the fifteen (15) day period referenced in Section 8.4(b)
above, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in any
such defense at its sole cost and expense, but, in such case, the Indemnified
Party shall control the investigation and defense thereof and shall have the
sole right to settle, compromise or discharge such Third-Party Claim.

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party agree to keep each other
reasonably informed of the status of developments with respect to any Third-
Party Claim and to make available to each other, their counsel, all non-
privileged information and documents available to them which relate to such
claim or demand at no cost to the Indemnifying Party (other than for
reasonable costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party). The Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party and their respective employees also agree to render
to each other such assistance and cooperation on a mutually convenient basis
as may reasonably be required to ensure the proper and adequate defense of
such claim or demand.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if and to the
extent any indemnification payments may become due and owing to the UK
Conveyed Entity pursuant to this Agreement, such payments shall instead be due
and owing to Buyer.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent
the procedures in this Section 8.4 are in conflict with the procedures in the
RandW Policy with regard to matters such as notice, control, settlement or
defense of claims, the procedures in the RandW Policy shall control, but this
Section 8.4(f) shall not relieve the Indemnified Party from its obligations
hereunder to give notice to the Indemnifying Party. For the avoidance of
doubt, each party and its agents and advisors shall reasonably cooperate with
the insurer under the RandW Policy in connection with the defense of any matter
which might reasonably constitute a Loss. The insurer under the RandW Policy
shall have the right to participate in the defense and settlement of any
Third-Party Claim other matter reasonably likely to be covered by the RandW
Policy.

Section 8.5 Certain Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification in respect of
any claim for indemnification unless and until (i) the amount of Losses
incurred in connection with any individual claim or series of related claims
based on a similar set of operative facts is greater than the De Minimis
Threshold and once the De Minimis Threshold has been exceeded, the Indemnified
Party may be indemnified for all Losses related thereto (the "Non De Minimis
Damages") and not just the amount in excess of the De Minimis Threshold (but
subject to any remaining amount of the Deductible), and (ii) the aggregate amount of Non De
Minimis Damages that have finally been determined to be indemnifiable pursuant
to this Article VIII exceeds one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the Unadjusted
Base Consideration Amount (the "Deductible"), and once the Deductible has been
exceeded, the Indemnified Party may be indemnified for all Non De Minimis
Damages in excess of the Deductible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
limitations set forth in this Section 8.5(a) shall not apply to Losses based
upon, arising out of, with respect to, or by reason of, any (i) inaccuracy in
or breach of any Fundamental Representation, (ii) fraud on the part of any
Seller or Buyer or (iii) any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
8.2(c), Section 8.2(d), Section 8.2(e), Section 8.2(f), Section 8.2(g),
Section 8.3(b) or Section 8.3(c).

(b) The aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Indemnifying Party shall
be liable pursuant to Article VIII shall not exceed one half of one percent
(0.5%) of the Unadjusted Base Consideration Amount (the "Indemnification
Limit"); provided, however, that the Indemnification Limit shall not apply to
Losses based upon, arising out of, with respect to, or by reason of, any (i)
inaccuracy in or breach of any Fundamental Representation, (ii) fraud on the
part of any Seller or Buyer or (iii) any claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.2(c), Section 8.2(d), Section 8.2(e), Section 8.2(f), Section
8.2(g), Section 8.3(b) or Section 8.3(c). With respect to the matters set
forth in sub-clause (iii) of the preceding sentence (other than covenants that
are required to be performed after the Closing), the aggregate liability of
the applicable Indemnifying Party shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
Unadjusted Base Consideration Amount (the "Liability Limit"). With respect to
any claim for indemnification for any inaccuracy in or breach of any
Fundamental Representation, the aggregate liability of the Indemnifying Party
shall not exceed the Unadjusted Base Consideration Amount (the "Aggregate
Liability Limit"). For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Liability Limit nor
the Aggregate Liability Limit shall apply to sub-clause (ii) in the third
preceding sentence.

(c) With respect to Buyer Losses claimed pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (except in
the case of fraud with respect thereto), and subject to Section 8.5(a), a
Buyer Indemnitee shall recover Buyer Losses (i) first, from the Sellers until
all Buyer Losses recovered from the Sellers pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (taken
together with Buyer Losses recovered from the Sellers pursuant to Section
8.2(b), if any) equal the Indemnification Limit and (ii) second, under the RandW
Policy in accordance with its terms.

(d) Solely with respect to Buyer Losses claimed pursuant to Section 8.2(b),
the Buyer Indemnitees shall recover such Buyer Losses (i) first, from the
Sellers until all Buyer Losses recovered from Sellers pursuant to Section
8.2(b) (taken together with Buyer Losses recovered from the Sellers pursuant
to Section 8.2(a), if any) equal the Indemnification Limit, (ii) second, under
the RandW Policy in accordance with its terms and subject to Section 8.5(e) and
(iii) third, directly from the Sellers.

(e) The Buyer Indemnitees shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover
Buyer Losses under the RandW Policy; provided that the Buyer Indemnitees may
concurrently seek recovery from the Sellers (subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article VIII) and the RandW Policy and any recoveries from the Sellers shall be subject
to the Buyer Indemnitees' reimbursement obligations set forth in the second
sentence of Section 8.5(f).

(f) The amount of any and all Buyer Losses indemnifiable under this Agreement
shall be determined net of any amounts recovered by a Buyer Indemnitee with
respect to such Buyer Losses from any third party or under or pursuant to any
insurance policy pursuant to which or under which a Buyer Indemnitee has
rights other than recoveries under the RandW Policy (unless and to the extent
such proceeds are recovered in respect of breaches of or inaccuracies in the
Sellers' Fundamental Representations in excess of the retention under the RandW
Policy), it being understood that any amounts recovered under or pursuant to
any insurance policy shall be calculated net of any reasonable costs
associated with pursuing such insurance proceeds, including any deductible,
co-pay, premium increase and other out-of-pocket costs and expenses. If any
Buyer Indemnitee receives such recovery from any third party or under or
pursuant to any insurance policy after receipt of payment from the Sellers
(other than the RandW Policy, unless and to the extent such proceeds are
recovered in respect of Sellers' Fundamental Representations in excess of the
retention under the RandW Policy), then such Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly pay
over to the Sellers the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the
amount of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in procuring such
recovery), but not in excess of any amount previously paid by the Sellers to
such Buyer Indemnitee in respect of such matter. The Sellers shall not be
required to indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section 8.2 against any Losses to the
extent that such liability was discharged (whether by payment or by the use or
set-off of any relief) on or before Closing.

(g) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party, the De Minimis
Threshold, the Deductible and the Indemnification Limit, the amount of any
loss shall be determined without duplication of any Loss for which an
indemnification claim has been made or could be made under any other
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement and shall be computed net of
any Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party with respect to
such Loss in the year such Loss is incurred, with the Loss treated as the last
item of expense or deduction realized for such year.

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
any Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2
hereof (other than Section 8.2(d)) (i) as to any fact, matter, circumstance or
event for which a specific reserve or accrual is included as a current
liability in the final Closing Date Net Working Capital or as a liability
(other than a current liability) in balance sheets as of the Balance Sheet
Date included in Financial Statements to the extent of such reserve or accrual
or (ii) to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is able to prove that any
Losses were attributable to such Indemnified Party's willful misconduct.

(i) In respect of any Loss for which indemnification may be sought pursuant to
Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
take commercially reasonable steps, at the Indemnifying Party's request and
expense, to mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event which gives
rise thereto. (j) For all Tax purposes, the Parties agree to treat indemnity payments made
pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the Closing Consideration
Amount except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

(k) For the avoidance of doubt, amounts in respect of which Buyer may be
entitled to indemnification under Section 8.2(c) through Section 8.2(g) shall
not be calculated as a multiple of earnings, profits, revenues or sales.

Section 8.6 Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy for any and all claims arising out of, in connection with or
relating to this Agreement and the Transactions shall be indemnification in
accordance with Section 5.2(h), Section 5.13, Section 5.26, Section 5.27 and
this Article VIII, and no other remedy shall be had pursuant to any contract,
misrepresentation, strict liability or tort theory or otherwise by any Party
and its officers, directors, employees, agents, Affiliates, attorneys,
consultants, insurers, successors and assigns, all such remedies being hereby
expressly waived to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In
furtherance of the foregoing, from and after the Closing, each of the Parties
hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all
other rights, claims, remedies and causes of action (including rights of
contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist
or may arise in the future, that such Party (or any Buyer Indemnitees or
Seller Indemnitees) may have against any of the Parties arising under, based
upon or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (including under any
federal, state or local Law). Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 8.6
shall not (i) apply to claims for specific performance or injunctive relief,
(ii) apply to claims for fraud, or (iii) operate to interfere with or impede
the operation of the provisions of Section 2.3 (providing for the resolution
of certain disputes relating to the Purchase Price Adjustments).

Section 8.7 Environmental Claims. In addition to any other limitations that
may apply, with respect to any claim for indemnification that Buyer may assert
for a misrepresentation or breach of warranty with respect to Section 3.19 (an
"Environmental Claim"), Buyer shall not be entitled to recover from the
Sellers for any Loss to the extent such Loss: (i) is discovered as a result of
Buyer conducting or arranging for sampling on or after the Closing Date of
soil, sediment, or groundwater except to the extent such sampling is (A)
required of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any of the Conveyed
Entities) by applicable Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits or
requested by any Governmental Entity, (B) required to be conducted in response
to a Third-Party Claim or (C) reasonably necessary to respond to or evaluate
the potential for a threat to human health or the environment; (ii) remediates
conditions of soil, groundwater, or any other environmental medium or vapor
intrusion to a standard more stringent than the least stringent standard under
applicable Environmental Laws or as requested by any Governmental Entity
(including site specific standards using risk-based methodologies and
institutional controls, where available) for the continued use of such
property in the manner in which it is used as of the date of this Agreement;
(iii) is not incurred in a reasonably cost-effective manner permitted by
applicable Environmental Law and which does not unreasonably interfere with
the use of the Real Property by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any
of the Conveyed Entities) or the ability to conduct the Conveyed Entities'
operations in the manner conducted as of the Closing and during the 12- month period prior to the Closing; (iv) arises out of a change in the nature
of the operations conducted at the relevant property as of the Closing Date
from an industrial or a commercial use to a residential use; or (v) is caused
by the negligent acts of Buyer or its Affiliates.

Article IX. 
MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.1 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except as expressly set
forth in Article III of this Agreement, no Seller nor any of their respective
agents, employees or representatives have made, nor are any of them making any
representation or warranty, express or implied, in respect of the Conveyed
Entities, nor are any of them making any representation or warranty regarding
the accuracy or completeness of any information provided to Buyer or Buyer's
agents, employees or representatives in connection with the negotiation of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, and any such other
representations or warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed. Without waiving
or limiting its rights set forth in this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges that
Buyer is relying on its own investigation and analysis in entering into this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and Buyer has undertaken
such investigation, and has been provided with and has evaluated such
documents and information as it has deemed necessary in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. Without waiving or
limiting its rights set forth in this Agreement, with respect to any
projection or forecast delivered by or on behalf of the Sellers to Buyer,
Buyer acknowledges that (v) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to
make such projections and forecasts, (w) the accuracy and correctness of such
projections and forecasts may be affected by information that may become
available through discovery or otherwise after the date of such projections
and forecasts, (x) such projections and forecasts have not been independently
verified, reflect various assumptions and may not prove to be correct, (y) it
is familiar with each of the foregoing and (z) such projections and forecasts
shall not form the basis of any claim (including in contract or tort, at law
or in equity under federal or state securities laws or otherwise) against
Sellers or their agents, employees or representatives with respect thereto or
with respect to any related matter. Buyer and Sellers acknowledge that each is
an informed and sophisticated participant in the Transactions and this
Agreement and related documents are the product of arms' length negotiations.

Section 9.2 Choice of Law. This Agreement, and all claims, disputes,
controversies or causes of action (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of, or relate to this Agreement,
or the breach, termination or validity hereof, or the negotiation, execution
or performance hereof or the Transactions, in each case whether now existing
or hereafter arising, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the internal Laws of the State of New York except for Laws governing conflicts
of law (other than Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General
Obligations Law).

Section 9.3 Dispute Resolution.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.13, any Action between the
Parties and or Cobham based upon, arising out of, or relating to this
Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity hereof, or the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof or the Transactions, in each case whether now existing or hereafter arising, and
whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise (a "Dispute") shall be resolved
as set forth in this Section 9.3.

(b) Any Action in respect of any Dispute, including for any Action for a
preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo or prevent irreparable harm,
shall be brought exclusively in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, or if such court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, in any New York court situated in the County of New York (the
"New York Courts"). By executing and delivering this Agreement, each of the
Parties and Cobham hereto irrevocably (i) accepts generally and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Courts
for any Action arising from any Dispute; (ii) waives any objections which such
Party or Cobham may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such
Action contemplated by this Section 9.3(b) and hereby further irrevocably
waives and agrees not to plead or claim that any such Action has been brought
in an inconvenient forum; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat the personal jurisdiction of the New York Courts by motion or other
request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that it will not bring any
Action contemplated by this Section 9.3(b) in any court other than the New
York Courts; (v) agrees that service of all process, including the summons and
complaint, in any Action may be made by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, to such Party or Cobham at their respective addresses
provided in accordance with Section 9.4 or in any other manner permitted by
Law; and (vi) agrees that service as provided in the preceding clause (v) is
sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over such Party or Cobham in the
Action, and otherwise constitutes effective and binding service in every
respect.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree and understand that any
Dispute with respect to an Indemnified Party's entitlement to indemnification
under Article VIII shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 9.3.

any of the provisions contained in this Agreement. Section 9.6 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise specified in this
Agreement, each Party hereto and Cobham shall bear its own costs and expenses
(including investment advisory and legal fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

Section 9.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Transaction Documents and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the
Parties hereto and Cobham with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the Parties with
respect to such subject matter.

Section 9.8 Interpretation.

(a) When a reference is made to an Article, Section, Schedule or Annex, such
reference shall be to an Article, Section, Schedule or Annex of or to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

(b) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

(c) Unless the context requires otherwise, words using the singular or plural
number also include the plural or singular number, respectively, and the use
of any gender herein shall be deemed to include the other genders. Terms
defined in Section 1.1, or otherwise, using the singular may also be set forth
using the plural (and when so used denote the plural of the defined term), and
vice-versa.

(d) The word "or" shall be disjunctive but not exclusive.

(e) All monetary figures shall be in United States dollars unless otherwise
specified. Any payments to be made under this Agreement or any other agreement
to be entered into pursuant to this Agreement by or to the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates shall be in United States dollars. Except as otherwise set
forth in this Agreement, where any such payments are to be made and the
underlying liability has been calculated in a currency other than United
States dollars, the underlying liability shall be converted into United States
dollars at the noon buying rate as quoted by the Wall Street Journal on the
Business Day prior to the date of payment. For the purposes of determining
whether the monetary limits referred to in Section 8.5 apply, liabilities in a
currency other than United States dollars shall be converted into United

the Business Day prior to payment or discharge of such Losses by the
Indemnifying Party.

(f) The terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereto" and derivative or similar
words refer to this entire Agreement.

(g) Any reference to the Laws of one jurisdiction shall, when expressed to
apply in relation to a Conveyed Entity incorporated in another jurisdiction,
be interpreted (to the extent possible) as a reference to the equivalent Laws
of the relevant jurisdiction of the Conveyed Entity in question. (h) This Agreement was prepared jointly by the Parties hereto and no rule that
it be construed against the drafter will have any application in its
construction or interpretation.

Section 9.9 Precedence. To the extent there is any conflict between this
Agreement and any other Transaction Document, this Agreement shall govern
unless this Agreement or the applicable Transaction Document expressly states
otherwise.

Section 9.10 Disclosure. The Seller Disclosure Schedule is incorporated into
and forms an integral part of this Agreement. Any matter disclosed in any
Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be considered disclosed with
respect to each other Section of such Schedule to the extent such disclosure
is reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure, but only to the
extent of such disclosure. The inclusion of information in any Section of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed as an admission that such
information is material or that such matter actually constitutes noncompliance
with, or a violation of, any Law, Permit or Contract or other topic to which
such disclosure is applicable.

Section 9.11 Waiver and Amendment. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented only by a written mutual agreement executed and delivered by the
Sellers and Buyer. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure
of any Party or Cobham to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition herein may be waived by the Party entitled to the benefits thereof
only by a written instrument signed by the Party granting such waiver, but
such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligations,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

Section 9.12 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties hereto and their permitted assigns and, except for
Section 5.7 and Article VIII, nothing herein express or implied shall give or
be construed to give to any Person, other than the Parties hereto and such
permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder. This Agreement may
only be enforced against the named Parties hereto and Cobham. All claims or
causes of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty
made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into
this Agreement), may be made only against the entities that are expressly
identified as Parties hereto or Cobham, and no officer, director or employee
of any Party hereto (including any Person negotiating or executing this
Agreement on behalf of a Party hereto) shall have any liability or obligation
with respect to this Agreement or with respect to any claim or cause of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may arise out of or relate to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including a representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement).

Section 9.13 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES AND COBHAM HEREBY
UNCONDITIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
JUDICIAL PROCEEDING IN ANY COURT RELATING TO ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM
ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, THE BREACH,
TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF SUCH AGREEMENTS OR DOCUMENTS OR THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF SUCH AGREEMENTS OR DOCUMENTS.

Section 9.14 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision hereof.

Section 9.15 Counterparts; Facsimile or PDF Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed, shall be
deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one
and the same instrument binding upon all of the Parties hereto and Cobham
notwithstanding the fact that all Parties and Cobham are not signatory to the
original or the same counterpart. For purposes of this Agreement, facsimile or
PDF signatures shall be deemed originals.

Section 9.16 Remedies. The Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

Section 9.17 No Right of Setoff. No Party hereto nor any Affiliate thereof may
deduct from, set off, holdback or otherwise reduce in any manner whatsoever
any amount owed to it hereunder against any amounts owed by the other Party
hereto or any Affiliate of such Party.

Section 9.18 Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Non-Assertion of
Attorney Client Privilege. Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to
cause the Conveyed Entities to waive and to not assert, any conflict of
interest arising out of or relating to any representation, after the Closing,
of the Sellers or any Affiliate of any Seller, or any of their respective
officers, employees, directors or managers, in any matter exclusively
involving this Agreement or the Transactions, by any legal counsel that has
represented any such Party prior to the Closing. Buyer waives and will not
assert, and agrees to cause the Conveyed Entities and each of its other
Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any attorney-client privilege with
respect to any communication occurring on or prior to the Closing between any
legal counsel and the Sellers, the Conveyed Entities, any other Affiliate of
the Sellers, or any of their respective officers, employees, directors and
managers exclusively relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, it being
the intention of the Parties that all such rights to such attorney-client
privilege and to control such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by
each Seller, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, employees,
directors or managers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, in the event that dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer, any
Conveyed Entity (or any of their Affiliates) and a third Person other than a
party to this Agreement, Buyer, the applicable Conveyed Entity (or their
applicable Affiliates) may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure to such Person of confidential communications between legal counsel
and such Conveyed Entity. Section 9.19 Assignment; Binding Effect. This Agreement and the rights
hereunder are not assignable unless such assignment is consented to in writing
by both Buyer and the Sellers and, subject to the preceding clause, this
Agreement and all the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns; provided, that Buyer may assign all or any portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement without such consent to any of its
Affiliates, which assignment shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations
hereunder.

Section 9.20 Performance. Cobham agrees to take all action necessary to cause
the Sellers to perform all of their respective agreements, covenants and
obligations under this Agreement. Cobham unconditionally guarantees to Buyer
the full and complete performance by the Sellers of their respective
obligations under this Agreement and shall be liable for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Sellers under this
Agreement. This is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of
collectability. Cobham hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of
performance, filing of any claim, any right to require any proceeding first
against the Sellers, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever in connection
with the performance of its obligations set forth in this Section 9.20.
