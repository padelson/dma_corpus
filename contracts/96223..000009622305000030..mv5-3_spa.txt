adjustment as follows:   (a) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Seller Representative shall estimate the Net Working
Capital of the Companies (taken as a whole) as of the close of business on
March 25, 2005 (the "ESTIMATED NET WORKING CAPITAL"); provided that, in the
event Purchaser disagrees, in good faith, with the Seller Representative\'s
estimate, the Parties shall mutually determine such estimate. The Estimated
Net Working Capital shall be prepared consistent with Exhibit C and shall use
the methodologies and treatment for certain items as set forth on Schedule
2.3 and shall in any event be calculated in accordance with the principles
and adjustments used in the determination of Net Working Capital as set forth
in the definition thereof. The cash consideration payable at Closing by
Purchaser to the Seller Representative Account pursuant to Section 2.2 shall
be (i) increased by the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working
Capital exceeds the Normalized Working Capital Amount or (ii) decreased by
the amount, if any, by which the Normalized Working Capital Amount exceeds
the Estimated Net Working Capital.   (b) Within forty-five (45) days
following the Closing, the Purchaser shall have prepared and delivered to the

the Companies reported on a consolidated basis with each other (an "AS IF
CONSOLIDATED BASIS") as of the Closing Date (the "NET WORKING CAPITAL BALANCE
SHEET"), using the methodologies and treatment for certain items as set forth
on Schedule 2.3, and (ii) a calculation of the Net Working Capital of the
Companies as of the Closing Date, prepared on the basis of the Net Working
Capital Balance Sheet, which shall (A) be prepared consistent with Exhibit C,
(B) use the methodologies and treatment for certain items as set forth on
Schedule 2.3, (C) be calculated in accordance with the principles and
adjustments used in the determination of Net Working Capital as set forth in
the definition thereof, and (D) notwithstanding anything else in the
definition of Net Working Capital to the contrary, include as
"current liabilities" of the Companies any costs incurred by, or attributable
to, the Sellers that are obligations of any of the Companies, including,
without limitation, any amounts reflected in the Net Working Capital Balance
Sheet in respect of the items set forth on Schedule 2.2 hereto that are in
excess of such amounts set forth on Schedule 2.2 hereto (the "NET WORKING
CAPITAL CALCULATION"). The Net Working Capital Balance Sheet and Net Working
Capital Calculation shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
application of the accounting principles applied in preparing the Estimated
Net Working Capital. In connection with the preparation of the Net Working
Capital Balance Sheet, the Seller Representative and Purchaser shall jointly
cause to be performed a physical inventory of all raw materials, work-in-
process and finished goods normally reflected as "inventory" on the financial
statements of the Companies, except with respect to consigned goods (for
which actual March 25, 2005 figures will be adjusted to the Closing Date
based on the Companies\' records) and rolling stock.   (c) Within forty-
five (45) days after the Net Working Capital Balance Sheet and the Net
Working Capital Calculation are delivered to the Seller Representative
pursuant to Section 2.3(b) hereof, the Seller Representative shall complete
its examination thereof and shall deliver to the Purchaser either   
11  (i) a written acknowledgment accepting the Net Working Capital Balance
Sheet and the Net Working Capital Calculation; or (ii) a written report
setting forth in reasonable detail any proposed adjustments to the Net
Working Capital Balance Sheet and the Net Working Capital Calculation (the
"ADJUSTMENT REPORT"). If the Seller Representative fails to respond to the
Purchaser within such forty-five (45) day period, the Seller Representative
shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Net Working Capital
Balance Sheet and the Net Working Capital Calculation as delivered pursuant
to Section 2.3(b) hereof. In the event of the delivery of an Adjustment
Report, the Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall attempt to resolve
the adjustments proposed therein within thirty (30) days after delivery of
the Adjustment Report, and the Seller Representative shall be deemed to have
accepted and agreed to the Net Working Capital Balance Sheet and the Net
Working Capital Calculation except as to the proposed adjustments set forth
in the Adjustment Report.   (d) In the event the Seller Representative and
the Purchaser fail to agree on any of the Seller Representative\'s proposed
adjustments contained in the Adjustment Report within thirty (30) days after
the Purchaser receives the Adjustment Report, then the Seller Representative
and the Purchaser mutually agree to jointly engage KPMG LLP, certified public
accountants (the "INDEPENDENT AUDITORS"), to resolve such dispute(s). As
promptly as practicable thereafter, the Seller Representative and the
Purchaser shall each prepare and submit a presentation to the Independent
Auditors and shall cause the Independent Auditors to make a determination as
to each disputed item based upon the presentations by the Seller
Representative and the Purchaser and in light of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement; provided that the Independent Auditors shall not make a final
determination as to any particular item which is higher than the highest
position set forth by either of the Parties or lower than the lowest position
set forth by either of the Parties. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Auditors shall be apportioned between the Seller Representative and the
Purchaser in inverse proportion to the aggregate amounts reflected in
the determinations made by the Independent Auditors on all disputes in
relation to the respective positions of the Seller Representative and the
Purchaser. All determinations made by the Independent Auditors will be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties.   (e) The Net Working Capital
Calculation shall be determined based on the Net Working Capital Balance
Sheet delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(b), as adjusted, if at all, pursuant
to this Section 2.3. The date on which the Net Working Capital Calculation is
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall hereinafter be referred
to as the "SETTLEMENT DATE."   (f) In the event the Net Working Capital
Calculation is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Seller
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) shall (i) deliver written
instructions signed by the Seller Representative to the Escrow Agent
directing the Escrow Agent to release to the Purchaser from the Working
Capital Escrow Account an amount equal to such deficiency (with the remainder
of such Working Capital Escrow Amount, if any, being concurrently delivered
to the Seller Representative), and (ii) to the extent that the Working
Capital Escrow Amount is less than such deficiency, pay to the Purchaser
within three (3) Business Days after the Settlement Date an amount equal to
the difference between (A) such deficiency and (B) the Working   
12  Capital Escrow Amount. In the event the Net Working Capital Calculation
is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Purchaser shall,
within three (3) Business Days after the Settlement Date (i) deliver
written instructions signed by the Purchaser to the Escrow Agent directing
the Escrow Agent to release the entire Working Capital Escrow Amount to the
Seller Representative and (ii) pay to the Seller Representative an amount
equal to the difference between (A) the Net Working Capital Calculation and
(B) the Estimated Net Working Capital. Any payment required pursuant to this
Section 2.3(f) shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the Purchase Price, and
shall be made by the wire transfer of immediately available federal funds for
credit to the recipient, at a bank account designated by such recipient in
writing (or, if amounts are owed to the Sellers, to the Seller Representative
Account).  Section 2.4 Escrow.   In order to partially secure the
indemnity obligations of the Sellers as set forth herein (including the
indemnities set forth in Article X and the obligation to pay any deficiency
owed pursuant to Section 2.3(f)), Purchaser and the Seller Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) shall execute at the Closing an escrow agreement in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit E (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT") with the
Escrow Agent whereby each of the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the
Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be held in separate interest-bearing
escrow accounts (such accounts, the "INDEMNIFICATION ESCROW ACCOUNT" and the
"WORKING CAPITAL ESCROW ACCOUNT", respectively). The Indemnification Escrow
Amount shall be used to satisfy amounts payable by the Sellers to the
Purchaser pursuant to Article X hereof; provided that any remaining amounts
in the Indemnification Escrow Account shall be paid to the Seller
Representative on December 31, 2006, less the amount equal to any unresolved
claim or claims for indemnification against the Sellers pursuant to Article X
hereof, all as more fully described in the Escrow Agreement. The Working
Capital Escrow Amount shall be used to satisfy the Sellers\' obligation to
pay any deficiency owed pursuant to Section 2.3(f) hereof and shall be
paid to the Purchaser and/or the Seller Representative, as the case may be,
within three (3) Business Days after the Settlement Date in accordance with
Section 2.3(f) hereof and as more fully described in the Escrow Agreement.
The Purchaser and the Sellers agree that the Escrow Amount shall be treated
as owned for all Tax purposes by the Sellers and all income earned with
respect to the Escrow Amount shall be owned by Sellers and allocated to the
Sellers for all Tax purposes.  Section 2.5 Sales and Transfer Taxes.  
The Sellers shall pay the cost of any and all stamp, transfer, goods and
services, sales, purchase, use, filing, value added, excise and similar Taxes
and fees which arise out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation, any stamp or transfer Tax or filing fee
relating to the transfer of the Shares, whether now in effect or
hereafter adopted and regardless of upon whom said Tax or fee is imposed. The
Purchaser and the Sellers shall take all commercially reasonable steps to
eliminate, to the extent possible, all such Taxes arising out of the
transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement.   13  Section 2.6
Further Assurances.   At any time and from time to time after the Closing,

Purchaser, and to confirm the Purchaser\'s rights to, title in and ownership
of, the Shares and to place the Purchaser in actual possession and operating
control of the Business to the extent purchased hereunder. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Sellers shall be entitled to reimbursement from the

extraordinary actions requested by the Purchaser.   ARTICLE III  CLOSING;

Sellers shall file, or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns which relate
exclusively to taxable periods that end on or before the Closing Date,
whether or not such Tax Returns are due before or after the Closing Date. It

of any Company or of Administrators, Inc. as of the end of the day prior to
the Closing Date, and any Taxes for a taxable period beginning on or before

ending on the day prior to the Closing Date, which portion shall equal (i) in
the case of Taxes that (x) are based upon or related to income or receipts or
(y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of
property, the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended on the
day prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of other Taxes imposed on
a periodic basis (including property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number

and such refunds, plus any interest earned in connection with such refunds,

ELECTIONS") with respect to each of the Companies other than ITC and ITC
Mountain. Any such request shall be made by the Purchaser in writing no later
than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date. For the purpose of making the
Section 338(h)(10) Elections for federal income tax purposes, on or prior to
the Closing Date, each Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser an executed
original IRS Form 8023 (or successor form) for each such Company. At any time
prior to the actual filing of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections, the Purchaser
may choose not to make such elections, in which case no Section 338(h)(10)
Elections will be made. If no Section 338(h)(10) Election is to be made, the
Form 8023 will be returned to the Seller Representative within 120 days of
the Closing Date. If a Section 338(h)(10) Election is to be made, the
Purchaser will file the Form 8023 with the IRS prior to the due date of such
form, and the Purchaser will provide the Seller Representative a copy of such
filing.   (ii) The Purchaser shall be responsible for the  preparation and
filing of all forms and documents required to  effectuate the Section
338(h)(10) Elections and the Sellers shall  cooperate with the Purchaser in
connection therewith. In addition to  the Form 8023, each Seller shall
execute (or cause to be executed)  and deliver to the Purchaser such
additional documents or forms as  are reasonably requested to complete
properly the Section 338(h)(10)  Elections, which delivery shall be timely,
in any event no later than  ten (10) days after the Purchaser provides such
additional documents  or forms to the Seller Representative. The Purchaser
and each Seller  shall file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
Section  338(h)(10) Elections and shall take no position contrary thereto 
unless required to do so by applicable tax laws.   (iii) Within sixty (60)
days of notifying the Seller  Representative of its intent to make any
Section 338(h)(10) Election,  the Purchaser shall provide the Seller
Representative a statement  (the "ALLOCATION STATEMENT") allocating the
portion of the Purchase  Price allocable to each such Company (which shall be
consistent with  and based on the final Relative Values, as reflected in
Exhibit D)  and any other items that are treated as additional Purchase Price
for  tax purposes among the different items of assets of each such  Company.
The Purchaser and each Seller shall allocate the Purchase  Price in
accordance with the Allocation Statement and all Tax Returns  and reports
filed by the Purchaser and each Seller shall be prepared  consistently with
such allocation.   (iv) The Purchaser shall pay to each Seller, in cash,
the  amount of additional consideration necessary to cause such Seller\'s 
after-Tax net proceeds from the sale of the Shares with the Section 
338(h)(10) Election to be equal to the after-Tax net proceeds that  such
Seller would have received had the Section 338(h)(10) Election  not been
made, taking into account all appropriate federal, state and  local Tax
implications, and taking into account any incremental  accountant or other
fees and expenses, including without limitation  the fees and expenses of the
Seller Tax Representatives (as defined  below), incurred as a result of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election (the  "Tax Adjustment"). The Sellers or the
Seller Representative shall  designate one or more accounting firms or other
independent third    41   parties (the "Seller Tax Representatives") that
shall provide the  Purchaser with a schedule tentatively computing the amount
of the Tax  Adjustment for each Seller after the Purchaser delivers the 
Allocation Statement (the "Initial Tax Adjustment"). In making such 
calculations, the highest individual federal, state and local Tax  rates to
which the Sellers are subject shall be used and all other  items of income,
deduction, gain, loss or credits of the Sellers  shall be taken into account.
The amount of the Initial Tax Adjustment  shall be promptly paid to the
appropriate Seller after the Parties  agree on the calculation of the Initial
Tax Adjustment. Promptly  following the preparation of the final 2005 tax
returns of each  Seller reflecting the Section 338(h)(10) elections, the
Seller Tax  Representatives shall provide the Purchaser with a final
schedule  reflecting the final Tax Adjustment (the "Final Tax Adjustment")..
To  the extent of any discrepancy between the Final Tax Adjustment and  the
Initial Tax Adjustment, payment shall be made to the appropriate  Party
promptly after the Parties agree on the calculation of the  Final Tax
Adjustment. The determination and resolution of the Initial  Tax Adjustment
and the Final Tax Adjustment shall be made by the  Purchaser and the Seller
Tax Representatives. In the event that there  is a dispute between one or
more of the Seller Tax Representatives  and the Purchaser regarding the
proper amount of a Tax Adjustment,  the dispute shall be resolved by the
Independent Auditors using  principles similar to those provided for in
Section 2.3(d).   (f) Any claim by any Party relating to a breach by another
Party of its obligations under this Section 9.1 shall be pursued in
accordance with the procedures for indemnification claims, and shall
otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions, set forth in Article X;
provided, however, that any Third Party Claim for Taxes that relates to a
taxable period that begins on or before the day prior to the Closing Date and
ends after the day prior to the Closing Date shall be controlled by both the
Purchaser and the Seller Representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other term or condition of Article X, (i) claims for a breach of an
obligation under this Section 9.1 may be made by a Party at any time prior to
the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable to the Tax matter to
which the claim relates and (ii) to the extent there is any inconsistency
between the terms of Article X and this Section 9.1 with respect to the
allocation of responsibility between the Seller and the Purchaser for Taxes
relating to the Companies or Administrators, Inc., the provisions of this
Section 9.1 shall govern. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, any claim for indemnity under
Article X in respect of an obligation under Section 9.1(e)(iv) shall not be
subject to and shall be paid without regard to the $500,000 "floor" and the
25% of Purchase Price "cap" provided in Section 10.2(a)(i) and (ii) and in
Section 10.3(a)(x) and (y).  Section 9.2 Proprietary Information.   From
and after the Closing, the Sellers shall not disclose or make use of (except
to pursue their rights under this Agreement), and the Sellers shall cause
their Affiliates not to disclose or make use of, any knowledge, information
or documents of a confidential nature or not generally known to the public
with respect to the Companies, the Business or the Purchaser or its business
(including the financial information, technical information or data relating
to the services and names of customers of the Companies, as well as filings
and testimony (if any) presented in the course of any indemnification   
42  claim under this Agreement, except to the extent that such
knowledge, information or documents shall have become public knowledge other
than through improper disclosure by the Sellers or any Affiliate of the
Sellers.  Section 9.3 Sharing of Information.   The Purchaser will, and
will cause the Companies to, cooperate with the Sellers and their Affiliates
and provide to the Sellers and their Affiliates, at the Sellers\' expense,
reasonable access and all information relating to the Companies which may be
required for the purpose of preparing financial statements for periods that
include a period prior to the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall maintain all
books and records related to operation of the Business prior to the Closing,
whether in paper, digital or other format, for a period of the greater of (i)
three (3) years after the Closing Date or (ii) such greater period as may be
required by applicable Law. Upon request by the Seller Representative, the
Purchaser shall make such books and records available to the Seller
Representative for review and copying; provided, that the Seller
Representative shall reimburse the Purchaser for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection therewith.  Section 9.4 Cooperation in
Litigation.   In connection with any legal action, claim, arbitration,
audit, hearing, investigation, dispute, inquiry, litigation, suit (whether
civil, criminal, administrative, investigative, or informal), formal review
or other proceeding (any of the foregoing, a "PROCEEDING") relating to the
Business or any of the Companies involving third parties including, without
limitation, any Third Party Claims subject to Section 10.4, and any
Proceeding relating to or arising out of the conduct of the Business or any
of the Companies prior to the Closing (other than litigation among the
Parties and/or their Affiliates arising out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) which could result in indemnifiable Adverse Consequences for
the Sellers, upon request by the Party responsible for such matter, the other
Party hereto shall make available its employees and other personnel and
cooperate with other requests of the responsible Party for assistance in
connection with resolution of such Proceeding (including, without limitation,
depositions and preparation for any formal proceedings related to such
Proceeding).   ARTICLE X  INDEMNIFICATION  Section 10.1 Survival of
Representations and Warranties.   All of the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue in full
force and effect until December 31, 2006, provided that (a) the
representations of the Sellers in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 shall survive the
Closing without limitation and (b) the representations of the Sellers in
Sections 4.10 and 4.14(b) shall survive the Closing until the expiration of
all applicable statutory periods of limitation applicable to the matters
referred to therein. If an Indemnified Party delivers to an
Indemnifying Party, before expiration of a representation or warranty, either
a Claim Notice or an Expected Claim Notice based upon a breach of such
representation or    43  warranty, then the applicable representation or
warranty shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of the
matter covered by such notice. If the legal Proceeding or written claim with
respect to which an Expected Claim Notice has been given is definitively
withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly so notify the Indemnifying Party.  Section 10.2
Indemnification Provisions for the Benefit of the  Purchaser.   (a) In the
(a) event of a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, obligation
or agreement of the Sellers contained in this Agreement (other than the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.19 hereof, for which
Seller\'s indemnification obligations are set forth in Section 10.7 hereof)
or any agreement or instrument furnished by (or on behalf of) the Sellers to
the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or (b) case of Taxes for taxable
periods (or portions thereof, determined in accordance with Section 9.1(b))
ending on or before the day prior to the Closing Date (except to the extent
such amount was actually taken into account, and decreased, the
final calculation of Net Working Capital), the Sellers jointly and severally
(except for the representations and warranties made by each Seller in
Sections 4.2 and 4.4(b), which are made on a several and not a joint basis)
agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates from
and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences the Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall incur or suffer resulting from or relating to any such
breach or Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Seller shall have any
obligation to indemnify the Purchaser or any Affiliate from and against any
Adverse Consequences caused by any breach of a representation or warranty (i)
until the Purchaser has suffered Adverse Consequences by reason of all such
breaches in excess of an aggregate threshold amount equal to $500,000, at
which point the Sellers will be liable for the aggregate amount of all
Adverse Consequences suffered under this Section 10.2 or (ii) for any amount
by which the aggregate Adverse Consequences the Purchaser has suffered by
reason of all such breaches of representations and warranties exceeds 25% of
the Purchase Price (the "CAP"); provided, that the limitations set forth in
clauses (i) and (ii) shall not apply to a claim relating to (and the Sellers
shall be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser or any Affiliate from and
against all Adverse Consequences resulting from or relating to) a breach
of (A) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.2, 4.4 and
4..10 or (B) any covenant, obligation or agreement of the Sellers contained
in this Agreement or any agreement or instrument furnished by (or on behalf
of) the Sellers to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. Any claim by
Purchaser for Adverse Consequences under this Section 10.2, if the Sellers
have an obligation to indemnify Purchaser for such Adverse Consequences
hereunder, shall first be made against the Indemnification Escrow Amount
under the terms of the Escrow Agreement except to the extent that the
existing Indemnification Escrow Amount is not sufficient to cover such
claim.    44  Section 10.3 Indemnification Provisions for the Benefit of
the Sellers.   (a) In the event of (i) a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, obligation or agreement of the Purchaser contained in
this Agreement or any agreement or instrument furnished by the Purchaser to
the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, or (ii) any Adverse Consequences
incurred by the Sellers on account of any matter, action or fact arising
after the Closing (other than to the extent such Adverse Consequences relate
to a breach by the Sellers of their representations under Article IV above),
then the Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and
their Affiliates from and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences
the Sellers and their Affiliates shall incur or suffer resulting from or
relating to any such breach, matter, action or fact. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchaser shall not have any obligation to indemnify the
Sellers from and against any Adverse Consequences caused by any breach of a
representation or warranty under clause (i) above (x) until the Sellers have
suffered Adverse Consequences by reason of all such breaches in excess of
$500,000, at which point the Purchaser will be liable for the aggregate
amount of all Adverse Consequences suffered under this Section 10.3 or (y)
for any amount by which the aggregate Adverse Consequences the Sellers have
suffered by reason of all such breaches of representations and warranties
exceeds the Cap.  Section 10.4 Indemnification Claims.   (a) Subject to
Section 9.1 hereof, if any third party shall commence any Proceeding for
which indemnification may be sought by a Party under this Article X (a "THIRD
PARTY CLAIM"), then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event
within fifteen (15) Business Days after receiving notice of the Third Party
Claim) notify the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing; provided, however,
that no delay or failure on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying
the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability
or obligation hereunder except to the extent of any damage or liability
caused by or arising out of such failure. Within fifteen (15) Business Days
after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written
notice thereof to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of
such Third Party Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party; provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party may only
assume control of such defense if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the
Indemnified Party that any damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that
may be assessed against the Indemnified Party in connection with such Third
Party Claim constitute Adverse Consequences for which the Indemnified Party
shall be indemnified pursuant to this Article X and (B) the ad damnum is less
than or equal to the amount of Adverse Consequences for which the
Indemnifying Party is liable under this Article X and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party may not assume control of the defense of Third Party Claim involving
criminal liability or in which equitable relief is sought against the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not permitted
under the terms hereof to, so assume control of the defense of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Non-controlling
Party may participate in such defense at its own expense. The Controlling
Party shall keep the Non-controlling Party advised of the status of such
Third Party Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The
Non-controlling Party shall furnish the    45  Controlling Party with
such information as it may have with respect to such Third Party Claim
(including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have
been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or
other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall
otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of
such Third Party Claim. The reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the
Indemnified Party with respect to a Third Party Claim shall be considered
Adverse Consequences for purposes of this Agreement if (i) the Indemnified
Party controls the defense of such Third Party Claim pursuant to the terms of
this Section 10.4(a) or (ii) the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such
defense and the Indemnified Party could not effectively be represented by the
same counsel due to conflicting interests with respect to such Third Party
Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that the consent of the
Indemnified Party shall not be required if the Indemnifying Party agrees in
writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment
and such settlement or judgment includes a complete release of the
Indemnified Party from further liability and has no other material adverse
effect on the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.   (b) In
order to seek indemnification under this Article X, an Indemnified Party
shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party. Within thirty (30)
days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver
to the Indemnified Party a Response, in which the Indemnifying
Party shall:   (i) if the claim has been made under Sections 10.2 or 
10.7, either (A) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to  receive all
of the Claimed Amount (in which case the Response shall  be accompanied by
either (1) instructions signed by the Seller  Representative to the Escrow
Agent directing the Escrow Agent to  release the Claimed Amount to the
Purchaser or (2) to the extent that  the existing Escrow Amount is not
sufficient to cover the Claimed  Amount, a payment by the Indemnifying Party
to the Indemnified Party  of the difference between the Claimed Amount and
the Escrow Amount,  by check or by wire transfer), (B) agree that the
Indemnified Party  is entitled to receive the Agreed Amount (in which case
the Response  shall be accompanied by either (1) instructions signed by the
Seller  Representative to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to 
release the Agreed Amount to the Purchaser or (2) to the extent that  the
existing Escrow Amount is not sufficient to cover the Agreed  Amount, a
payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party  of the difference
between the Agreed Amount and the Escrow Amount, by  check or by wire
transfer and the Claimed Amount which is in excess  of the Agreed Amount
shall be deemed disputed) or (C) dispute that  the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive any of the Claimed  Amount.   (ii) if the claim has
been made under Section 10.3, either  (A) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive all of  the Claimed Amount (in which case the Response
shall be accompanied  by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party of  the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire transfer), (B)
agree that the    46   Indemnified Party is entitled to receive the
Agreed Amount (in which  case the Response shall be accompanied by a payment
by the  Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount,
by  check or by wire transfer and the Claimed Amount which is in excess  of
the Agreed Amount shall be deemed disputed) or (C) dispute that  the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed 
Amount.  During the thirty (30) day period following the delivery of a
Response that reflects a dispute, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall use good faith efforts to resolve the dispute. If the dispute is
not resolved within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnified Party will
be free to pursue all remedies available to it under this Agreement or
otherwise in law or in equity.  Section 10.5 Determination of Adverse
Consequences.   (a) The amount of Adverse Consequences recoverable by an
Indemnified Party under this Article X with respect to an indemnity claim
shall be reduced by (i) any proceeds received by such Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates, with respect to the Adverse Consequences to which such
indemnity claim relates, from an insurance carrier, (ii) the amount of any
tax savings actually realized by such Indemnified Party or an Affiliate for
the tax year in which such Adverse Consequences are incurred, which are
attributable to the Adverse Consequences to which such indemnity claim
relates, and shall be increased by any increased tax liability which may
result from the receipt of the indemnity payment or any insurance proceeds
relating to such Adverse Consequences, and (iii) any amounts taken into
account as a downward adjustment in the Net Working Capital Calculation. All
indemnification payments made to an Indemnified Party under this Article X
shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase Price.   (b) For purposes of
Article X, any Adverse Consequences suffered or incurred by any of the
Companies arising from a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation by a Seller shall be deemed suffered or incurred by
the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall be entitled to seek indemnification
under this Article X against the Sellers for any such Adverse Consequences
without any liability of the Companies. Each Seller waives any and all rights
of contribution, cost recovery or other payment from the Companies, whether
arising by agreement or operation of Law, to the extent of any liability of
the Companies owed to any of the Sellers under this Agreement.  Section 10.6
Exclusive Remedy.   Except in the case of fraud, the Purchaser and the
Sellers acknowledge and agree that, after the Closing, the foregoing
indemnification provisions in this Article X shall be the exclusive remedy of
the Purchaser and the Sellers with respect to claims resulting from or
relating to any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to perform
or fulfill any covenant, obligation or agreement contained in this
Agreement.    47  Section 10.7 Special Environmental Indemnification for
the Benefit of  the Purchaser.   (a) In addition to the Sellers\'
obligations pursuant to Section 10.2 hereof, subject to the limitations set
forth in Sections 10.7(c) through (e) hereof, Sellers jointly and severally
shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates, including any
of the Companies, from and against the entirety of (i) Excluded Liabilities,
(ii) Environmental Matters, including, without limitation, Remedial
Liabilities, arising out of or related to any condition identified on
Schedule 10.7 hereto ("Environmental Conditions"), and (iii) breaches of the
representations and warranties of the Sellers set forth in Section 4.19
hereof (and breaches of other representations and warranties of the Sellers
to the extent such breaches specifically and solely relate to Environmental
Matters). Any claim by Purchaser for any amounts in respect of the items set
forth in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 10.7(a), if the Sellers
have an obligation to indemnify Purchaser for such amounts hereunder, shall
first be made against the Indemnification Escrow Amount under the terms
of the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent that the existing
Indemnification Escrow Amount is not sufficient to cover such claim.   (b)
Purchaser shall have the right to undertake any investigation it determines,
in its sole discretion, is necessary into any or all
Environmental Conditions, including the right to undertake soil and
groundwater investigations ("Purchaser\'s Investigations"). If Purchaser\'s
Investigations reveal violations of Environmental Laws or the presence of
Hazardous Materials in concentrations in excess of those allowed by
Environmental Laws, Purchaser shall have the right to undertake necessary
Remedial Action. Purchaser shall control any Remedial Actions of
Environmental Matters; provided that such Remedial Actions shall be conducted
in a reasonable and cost effective manner. The cost of any such Remedial
Actions shall constitute Remedial Liabilities.   (c) The Purchaser\'s right
to indemnification pursuant to clauses (a)(ii) and (a)(iii) of this Section
10.7 shall survive until December 31, 2006, and the Sellers shall have no
obligations for claims by the Purchaser for indemnification arising out of or
related to Environmental Conditions if the Purchaser does not deliver a Claim
Notice with respect to such claims on or before December 31, 2006. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that all Environmental Conditions shall be
deemed disclosed under and scheduled as exceptions to Section 4.19 hereof.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Purchaser\'s right to indemnification pursuant to clause (a)(i) of this
Section 10.7, with respect to indemnification for Excluded Liabilities, shall
not expire.   (d) The Sellers shall have no obligation under clauses (a)(ii)
or (a)(iii) of this Section 10.7 to indemnify the Purchaser until the
aggregate of all (i) Remedial Liabilities associated with the Environmental
Conditions and (ii) Adverse Consequences resulting from breaches of the
representations and warranties of the Sellers set forth in Section 4.19
hereof, exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "Environmental
Deductible"). The Environmental Deductible shall not apply to any claim by
Purchaser for indemnification for Excluded Liabilities under clause (a)(i) of
this Section 10.7. For the    48  elimination of doubt, the Deductible in
Section 10.2 hereof shall not apply to indemnification pursuant to this
Section 10.7.   (e) Claims for indemnification pursuant to this Section 10.7
shall not be subject to the Cap in Section 10.2 hereof; provided that Sellers
shall have no liability pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of this Section 10.7 for
any Remedial Liabilities associated with Environmental Conditions or pursuant
to clause (a)(iii) of this Section 10.7, in the aggregate, in excess of
Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) over and above the Environmental Deductible
paid by the Purchaser (the "Environmental Cap"). Claims for indemnification
pursuant to clauses (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) of this Section 10.7 shall apply
towards the Cap set forth in Section 10.2. Claims made with respect to
Excluded Liabilities shall not be subject to, and shall not apply towards,
the Cap or the Environmental Cap.   (f) For purposes of this Agreement, the
following terms have the following definitions: (i) "Excluded Liabilities"
means Remedial Liabilities arising from or associated with any real property
formerly owned, leased, operated or occupied by any of the Companies or any
of their respective predecessors and not included in the Real Property. Real
property formerly owned, leased, operated or occupied includes, without
limitation, real property formerly owned or operated in Montrose, Colorado;
Mountain Home, Idaho; and Missoula, Montana; (ii) "Remedial Action" includes
any and all actions to respond to a Release or threatened Release of
Hazardous Materials into the environment, to prevent or minimize the Release
of Hazardous Materials so that they do not migrate to cause substantial
danger to present or future public health or welfare or the environment, and
to remedy a violation of Environmental Laws. The term includes, but is not
limited to, actions and costs listed in the definition of "Remedial Action"
in CERCLA; and (iii) "Remedial Liabilities" means all Adverse Consequences
arising from Remedial Action, including, but not limited to, fees and
expenses of experts and the costs of investigation, including, without
limitation, Purchaser\'s Investigations, assessment, testing, remedial
design, implementation of a remedy, and monitoring.   ARTICLE XI

and the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) may terminate this
Agreement by mutual written consent at any time prior to the Closing;   (b)
the Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the

of the breach, and the breach has continued without cure for a period of
thirty (30) days after the notice of breach was delivered by the   
49  Purchaser to the Seller Representative or (ii) if the Closing shall not
have occurred on or before June 1, 2005 by reason of the failure of any
condition precedent under Article VIII hereof (unless such failure results
from the Purchaser breaching any representation, warranty, or covenant
contained in this Agreement); and   (c) the Seller Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice
to the Purchaser at any time prior to the Closing (i) in the event the

this Agreement, such breach would cause the conditions set forth in Section
7.1 not to be satisfied, the Seller Representative has notified the Purchaser
of the breach, and the breach has continued without cure for a period of
thirty (30) days after the notice of breach was delivered by the Seller
Representative to the Purchaser or (ii) if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before June 1, 2005 by reason of the failure of any condition
precedent under Article VII hereof (unless such failure results from the
Sellers breaching any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this
Agreement).  Section 11.2 Effect of Termination.   If any Party terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1, all obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall terminate without any liability of any Party to the other

contained in Section 6.4 and the provisions of Article XIII shall survive
termination.   ARTICLE XII  EMPLOYEES  Section 12.1 Employment by the
Purchaser.   The Purchaser shall cause the Companies to continue the
employment of all of the Company Employees (other than those employees that
the Purchaser designates on Schedule 12.1 not later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to Closing); it being understood that any such employment that is
"at will" employment prior to Closing may continue to be so after the
Closing. The initial terms of employment of such employees shall be the same,
including with respect to benefits, as such employees enjoy prior to Closing.
The Sellers shall be responsible for any and all (i) bonuses and profit
sharing accrued by any of the Companies during the fiscal year ended March
25, 2005 under any Company Plans in accordance with their terms (and any such
accruals shall be disregarded for purposes of the adjustment to the Purchase
Price set forth in Section 2.3 hereof) and (ii) any other payments to Company
Employees set forth on Schedule 4.14(c).   50   ARTICLE XIII 
GENERAL  Section 13.1 The Seller Representative.   (a) Each Seller
irrevocably constitutes and appoints Larry D. Williams (the "SELLER
REPRESENTATIVE") as such Seller\'s true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent
and authorizes him acting for such Seller and in such Seller\'s name, place
and stead, in any and all capacities to do and perform every act and thing
required or permitted to be done in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents contemplated hereby, as fully to all intents and purposes as such
Seller might or could do in person, including without limitation resolution
of any adjustment or proposed adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.3 and resolution of any claim made by the Purchaser under Article
X. Each Seller grants unto said attorney-in-fact and agent full power and
authority to do and perform each and every act and thing necessary or
desirable to be done in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, as fully to all intents and purposes as the
undersigned might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all
that the Seller Representative may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue
hereof. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that upon execution of this
Agreement, upon any delivery by the Seller Representative of any waiver,
amendment, agreement, opinion, certificate or other document executed by the
Seller Representative, such Seller shall be bound by such documents as fully
as if such Seller had executed and delivered such documents. The Seller
Representative acknowledges that he shall cause all receipts obtained and/or
disbursements required to be paid on a pro rata basis (determined according
to Relative Value) among the Sellers, except, as applicable, with regard to
any amounts owed to the Purchaser due to the breach of a representation made
under Sections 4.2 or 4.4(b) on a several basis, in which case any amounts
payable shall be solely attributed to the breaching Seller.   (b) Upon the
death, disability or incapacity of the initial Seller Representative
appointed pursuant to Section 13.1(a) above, each Seller acknowledges and
agrees that the Seller Representative\'s executor, guardian or legal
representative, as the case may be, shall appoint a replacement
reasonably believed by such Person as capable of carrying out the duties and
performing the obligations of the Seller Representative hereunder within
thirty (30) days of such death, disability or incapacity. Each Seller agrees
to pay, in proportion to such Seller\'s Relative Value, such Seller\'s share
of any and all costs incurred or payable by Seller Representative in its
capacity as such under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Agreements,
including with regard to any costs covered under Section 13.12.   (c) Each
Seller agrees that Purchaser shall be entitled to rely on any action taken by
the Seller Representative on behalf of the Sellers pursuant to Section
13.1(a) above (each, an "AUTHORIZED ACTION"), and that each Authorized Action
shall be binding on each Seller as fully as if such Seller had taken such
Authorized Action. The Sellers agree to pay, and to indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser, its Affiliates (including the Companies after
the Closing), and their respective officers, directors and representatives
from and against any Adverse Consequences which they may suffer, sustain, or
become    51  subject to, as the result of any claim by any Seller that
an Authorized Action is not binding on, or enforceable against, any of the
Sellers.  Section 13.2 Press Releases and Public Announcements.   No Party
shall issue any press release or make any other public announcement relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement prior to the Closing without the
prior written approval of the other Party, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the sole judgment of Purchaser
or the Seller Representative, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable
Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which the Purchaser
lists securities.  Section 13.3 No Third-Party Beneficiaries.   This
Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.  Section
13.4 Entire Agreement.   This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Transaction Documents and the other documents referred to
herein, constitute the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes
any prior understandings, agreements, or representations by or between the
Parties, written or oral, to the extent they related in any way to the
subject matter hereof.  Section 13.5 Succession and Assignment.   This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties named
herein and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No Party may
assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations
hereunder without the prior written approval of the other Party; provided,
however, that Purchaser may assign this Agreement and any or all of its
rights or obligations hereunder (including, without limitation,
Purchaser\'s rights to purchase the Shares and Purchaser\'s rights to seek
indemnification hereunder) to any Affiliate of Purchaser; provided, further,
however, that no assignment of any obligations hereunder shall relieve the
Parties hereto of any such obligations. Upon any such permitted assignment,
the references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall also apply to any such
assignee unless the context otherwise requires.  Section 13.6
Counterparts.   This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together will
constitute one and the same instrument.   52  Section 13.7 Headings.

or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the

invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the
determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to limit
the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
