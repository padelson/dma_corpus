Section 4.01 _Effect of Merger on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company or their respective
stockholders, (i) each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares and any Dissenting Shares)
shall be cancelled and automatically converted into and shall thereafter
represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price
(such amount of cash hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_
"), payable to the holder thereof, without interest, in accordance with
_Section 4.02_, (ii) all Shares that are owned directly by Parent or its
wholly-owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time or held in
treasury of the Company or by any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries (in each
case, other than any such Shares held in a fiduciary capacity or otherwise on
behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled
without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist and no payment shall
be made in respect thereof and (iii) each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, without par value, of Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par value, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and without
duplication of any adjustment made pursuant to _Section 2.01(f)_, if at any
time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted to reflect such reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or stock
dividend thereon.

 



 

Section 4.02 _Exchange Procedures; Surrender and Payment_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, all of the Shares converted into the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _ARTICLE IV_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate evidencing Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ") and
each holder of book-entry, non-certificated Shares (each, a " _Book-Entry
Share_ "), in each case outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and previously representing any such Shares, shall thereafter cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Shares except as specifically provided in this
Agreement or by Applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _ARTICLE IV_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust
company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as Paying Agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of (i) the Merger Consideration in
respect of each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented by a Certificate and each Book-Entry Share outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, in each case, other than any Cancelled Shares,
any Dissenting Shares, any Employee Restricted Shares and any Employee Company
RSUs, and (ii) without duplication, the aggregate Restricted Share
Consideration and aggregate RSU Consideration payable by the Paying Agent

Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash in an
amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, aggregate
Restricted Share Consideration and aggregate RSU Consideration required to be
paid by the Paying Agent in accordance with this Agreement (such cash shall be
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the
Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments in connection with
the aggregate Merger Consideration contemplated by _Section 4.01_ or the
aggregate Restricted Share Consideration or aggregate RSU Consideration
contemplated by _Section 4.05_ and payable by the Paying Agent, Parent shall
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying
Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency. The Paying Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 4.01_ and the Restricted Share
Consideration and RSU Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to
_Section 4.05_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose.

 



 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the third Business Day following the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Paying Agent to send to each holder of record of Shares
(other than any Cancelled Shares, any Dissenting Shares, any Employee
Restricted Shares and any Employee Company RSUs) represented by Certificate(s)
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) to the Paying Agent) in such form as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree, for use in effecting delivery of Shares to the Paying Agent,
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. No holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a
Certificate or a letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent in order to receive
the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 4.01_ in respect of such Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(d) Upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or an affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof), together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions, or (ii) compliance with the reasonable procedures established by
the Paying Agent for delivery of Book-Entry Shares, the holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive promptly in
exchange therefor, in cash, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, and the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE
IV_.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer Taxes required by reason of the making of such cash payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by Stockholders or
holders of Cashed Out Company Restricted Shares or Cashed Out Company RSUs
after the date which is one year following the Effective Time shall, upon
Parents demand, be returned to Parent. Any Stockholder who has not exchanged
such Stockholders cancelled Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this _Section 4.02_ and any holder of Cashed Out Company Restricted
Shares or Cashed Out Company RSUs who has not received the Restricted Share
Consideration or RSU Consideration, as applicable, in accordance with _Section
4.05_, in each case prior to the time the remaining portion of the Exchange
Fund is returned to Parent, shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery
of the Merger Consideration in respect of such Stockholders cancelled Shares,
the Restricted Share Consideration in respect of such holders Cashed Out
Company Restricted Shares, or the RSU Consideration in respect of such
holders Cashed Out Company RSUs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
to any Person for any Merger Consideration, Restricted Share Consideration or
RSU Consideration, as applicable, delivered to a Governmental Authority
pursuant to Applicable Law, including applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar laws.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent
pursuant to this _Section 4.02_ to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights
shall have been perfected pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be
returned to Parent upon Parents demand.

 



 

(h) All Merger Consideration paid in respect of Shares, Restricted Share
Consideration paid in respect of Cashed Out Company Restricted Shares or RSU
Consideration paid in respect of Cashed Out Company RSUs in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares, Cashed Out Company
Restricted Shares or Cashed Out Company RSUs, as applicable.

 



 

Section 4.03 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this
_ARTICLE IV_.

 



 

Section 4.04 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable
to any Person pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment pursuant to the Code or under any provision of
Applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, Acquisition
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 4.05 _Treatment of Company Restricted Shares and Company RSUs_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each Company Restricted Share that is
outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Cashed Out Company Restricted Share_ ") shall, as of the Effective Time,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, vest
and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse (with performance-based
awards vesting at maximum levels), and the maximum number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such grant of Company Restricted Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration payable to the holders thereof without interest (the "
_Restricted Share Consideration_ ").

 



 

(b) Any Person entitled to Restricted Share Consideration in respect of Cashed
Out Company Restricted Shares (i) who is a current or former employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (the Cashed Out Company Restricted Shares held by
such Persons, the " _Employee Restricted Shares_ ") shall be paid such
Restricted Share Consideration through the payroll system of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries in not less than three Business Days
following the Closing Date and (ii) who is not a current or former employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be paid such Restricted Share
Consideration through the Paying Agent in accordance with Section 4.02.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each Company RSU that is outstanding and
unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Cashed Out Company
RSU_ ") shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (with performance-based
awards receiving cash at maximum levels) equal to the Merger Consideration
payable to the holders thereof without interest (the " _RSU Consideration_ ").

 



 

(d) Any Person entitled to RSU Consideration in respect of Cashed Out Company
RSUs (i) who is a current or former employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the Cashed Out Company RSUs held by such Persons, the "
_Employee Company RSUs_ ") shall be paid such RSU Consideration through the
payroll system of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries in not less
than three Business Days following the Closing Date and (ii) who is not a
current or former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be paid
such RSU Consideration through the Paying Agent in accordance with Section
4.02.

 



 

(e) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, following the Effective
Time, no holder of a Company Compensatory Award or any participant in the
Company Stock Plan, or other Company Employee Plan or employee benefit
arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement, shall have any
right hereunder to acquire any capital stock or

 



      
 

 



 

other equity interests (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation
rights) in the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 4.06 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to each Share, if any, as to which the holder thereof shall have (i) properly
complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights
and (ii) not effectively withdrawn or lost such holders rights to appraisal
(each, a " _Dissenting Share_ "), such holder shall be entitled to payment,
solely from the Surviving Corporation, of the fair value of the Dissenting
Shares to the extent permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL and Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any holder of
Dissenting Shares (x) under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance
with the DGCL, affirmatively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) its appraisal rights in respect of such Dissenting Shares, (y)
fails to establish such holders entitlement to appraisal rights as provided
in the DGCL or (z) takes or fails to take any action the consequence of which
is that such holder is not entitled to payment for such holders Dissenting
Shares under the DGCL, then in each such case, such holder or holders (as the
case may be) shall forfeit appraisal rights in respect of such Dissenting
Shares and such Shares shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares,
and each such Share shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law,
thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Shares and the opportunity to direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands for appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, (i) voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal for Dissenting Shares, (ii) offer to settle any such
demands, (iii) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal in accordance with the DGCL or (iv) agree to do any of the

corporation and, where such concept is recognized, is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties makes such
qualification or good standing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) _Section 5.01(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of the Companys Subsidiaries, as of the date of

use and operate its properties, rights and other assets and to carry on its
business as currently conducted.

 



 

(c) The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of

authorize or adopt this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions.

described in the immediately preceding sentence has been amended, rescinded or
modified in any respect.

 



 

Section 5.03 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and

Act, the Securities Act and any other applicable U.S. state or federal
securities, takeover or "blue sky" laws, (iv) compliance with any applicable

consummate the Transactions or have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.04 _Non-Contravention_. Except as set forth on Section 5.04 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the execution, delivery and performance by the

Section 5.06 _Company SEC Documents; Company Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
registration statements, proxy statements and other statements, reports,
schedules, forms and other documents required to be filed or furnished by it
with the SEC (the " _Company SEC Documents_ ") during the period since August
1, 2013. Other than the obligation of Athlon Holdings LP and Athlon Finance
Corp. to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act arising in respect of a registration statement on Form S-4 (File
No. 333-XXXXXX), none of the Companys Subsidiaries is required to file
periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. As of their
respective effective dates (in the case of the Company SEC Documents that are
registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities
Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other
Company SEC Documents), or in each case, if amended prior to the date hereof,
as of the date of the last such amendment: (i) each of the Company SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company
SEC Documents (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") (as the case may be) and (ii)
none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) The financial statements (including any related notes) contained in the
Company SEC Documents, excluding pro forma financial statements (collectively,
the " _Company Financial Statements_ "): (i) were prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except as
may be indicated in the notes to such Company Financial Statements or, in the
case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC, and except
that the unaudited Company Financial Statements may not contain footnotes and
are subject to normal year-end adjustments, none of which individually or in
the

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate will be material in nature or amount) and (ii) fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby (except as may be
indicated in the notes to such Company Financial Statements or, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC, and except that
the unaudited Company Financial Statements may not contain footnotes and are
subject to normal year-end adjustments, none of which individually or in the
aggregate will be material in nature or amount).

 



 

(c) The pro forma financial statements (including any related notes) contained
in the Company SEC Documents include assumptions that provide a reasonable
basis for presenting the significant effects directly attributable to the
transactions and events described therein, the related pro forma adjustments
give appropriate effect to those assumptions, and the pro forma adjustments
reflect the proper application of those adjustments to the historical
financial statement amounts in the pro forma financial statements (including
any related notes) contained in the Company SEC Documents. The pro forma
financial statements (including any related notes) contained in the Company
SEC Documents comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act and the pro
forma adjustments have been properly applied to the historical amounts in the
compilation of those statements.

 



 

(d) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f), as
applicable, under the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting, including policies and
procedures that (i) mandate the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the material transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in
accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the Company Board
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company, as at June 30,
2014, there were no material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in such
internal controls and as of the date of this Agreement, nothing has come to
the attention of the Company that has caused the Company to believe that there
are any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in such internal
controls. To the Knowledge of the Company, since August 1, 2013, no complaints
from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing
matters have been received by the Company. Since August 1, 2013, the Company
has not received any complaints through the Companys whistleblower hotline or
equivalent system for receipt of employee concerns regarding possible
violations of Applicable Law. Since August 1, 2013 , no attorney representing
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of Applicable
Law that are securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the
Companys chief legal officer, audit committee of the Company Board or to the
Company Board pursuant to the rules adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act or any Company policy contemplating such reporting. Since
August 1, 2013, the Company has

 



       
 

 



 

complied in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate
governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

 



 

(e) With respect to each annual report on Form 10-K and each quarterly report
on Form 10-Q included in the Company SEC Documents, the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of the Company have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC and the NYSE as of their respective dates,
and the statements contained in any such certifications are complete and
correct as of their respective dates.

 



 

(f) The "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or
15d-15(e), as applicable, of the Exchange Act) of the Company are designed to
ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by the Company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the management of the Company as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The management of the Company
has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures as of June 30, 2014, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective.

 



 

(g) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among one or more of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand), or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in
Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiarys published financial
statements or other Company SEC Documents.

 



 

(h) The Company SEC Documents accurately summarize, in all material respects,
the outstanding Derivative positions of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including Hydrocarbon and financial Derivative positions attributable to the
production and marketing of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as of the dates
reflected therein.

to all of the Oil and Gas Interests reflected in the Company Reserve Reports
or disclosed in the Company SEC Documents and attributable to interests owned
by the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case free and clear of all Liens
other than Permitted Liens and Production Burdens. Each Oil and Gas Lease to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party is valid and in full
force and effect, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated in any material respect any
provision of, or taken or failed to take any act which, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a material default under the
provisions of any Oil and Gas Lease. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice from the other party to any Oil and
Gas Lease that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, has
breached, violated or defaulted in each case, in any material respect, under
any Oil and Gas Lease.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has good and valid title, in all
material respects, to each real property (and each real property at which its

_Company Owned Real Property_ "). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
a good and valid leasehold interest in each lease, sublease and other
agreement under which it uses or occupies or has the right to use or occupy
any real property (or real property at which its operations are conducted)
(but excluding Oil and Gas Interests) (such property subject to a lease,
sublease or other agreement, the " _Company Leased Real Property_ " and such
leases, subleases and other agreements are, collectively, the " _Company Real
Property Leases_ "), in each case, free and clear of all Liens other than any
Permitted Liens, and other than any conditions, encroachments, easements,
rights-of-way, restrictions and other encumbrances that do not adversely
affect the existing use of the real property subject thereto by the owner (or
lessee to the extent a leased property) thereof in the operation of its
business. Each Company Real Property Lease is valid, binding and in full force
and effect, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. No uncured default of a
material nature on the part of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, the landlord thereunder, exists under any
Company Real Property Lease, and no event has occurred or circumstance exists
which, with or without the giving of notice, the passage of time, or both,
would constitute a material breach or default under a Company Real Property
Lease. _Section 5.12(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
correct and complete list of the Company Owned Real Property and the Company
Leased Real Property (collectively, the " _Company Real Property_ ").

affecting any portion of the Company Real Property that would reasonably be

respective businesses thereon. Except for such arrangements solely between or
among the Company and its Subsidiaries, there are no outstanding options or
rights of first refusal in favor of any other party to purchase any Company
Owned Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein that would
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the existing use of the
Company Owned Real Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
operation of their respective businesses thereon. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is currently subleasing, licensing or otherwise granting
any person the right to use or occupy a material portion of a Company Real
Property that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the
existing use of such Company Real Property by the Company and its Subsidiaries
in the operation of their respective businesses thereon. The Company Real
Property constitutes all of the material real estate used in the operation of
the respective businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
appropriation, condemnation or like Proceeding or Order materially affecting
the Company Owned Real Property or any part thereof or of any sale or other
disposition of the Company Owned Real Property or any part thereof in lieu of
condemnation or other matters materially affecting and impairing the current
use, occupancy or value thereof.

income Tax Return to be filed under Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of
the Code.

 



 

(j) Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the Company or one of its Subsidiaries has good and

personal property reflected on the Company Balance Sheet or acquired after the
Company Balance Sheet Date, except for tangible personal property sold since
the Company Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business. None of

and correct copies of all written reports delivered to or received by the
Company or its Subsidiaries on or before the date of this Agreement estimating

by any unaffiliated person (each, a " _Company Report Preparer_ ") concerning
the Oil and Gas Interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and which
reports are set forth in _Section 5.13_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Company Reserve Reports_ "). The factual, non-interpretive data

in connection with the preparation of the Company Reserve Reports that was
material to such Company Report Preparers estimates of the oil and gas
reserves set forth in the Company Reserve Reports was, as of the time provided

Reports), accurate in all material respects. To the Knowledge of the Company,
there are no material errors in the assumptions and estimates provided by the
Company to any Company Report Preparer in connection with their preparation of
any Company Reserve Reports prepared by such Company Report Preparer. The oil
and gas reserve estimates of the Company set forth in the Company Reserve
Reports are derived from reports that have been prepared by the Company Report
Preparer as set forth therein, and such reserve estimates fairly reflect, in
all material respects, the oil and gas reserves of the Company at the dates
indicated therein and are in accordance with the rules promulgated by the SEC
and applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods reflected therein.
Except for changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration,
development and production industry (including changes in commodity prices)
and normal depletion by production, there has been no material change in
respect of the matters addressed in the Company Reserve Reports.

Proposal or any request for discussions or negotiations regarding an
Acquisition Proposal that is received from any Person (other than Parent,
Acquisition Sub or their Representatives) after the date hereof by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their Representatives and thereafter shall (x)
keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any event within 48
hours), of any material development regarding the status or terms of any such
expressions of interest, proposals or offers (including any amendments
thereto) or requests and shall reasonably promptly (and in any event within 48
hours) apprise Parent of the status of any such discussions or negotiations
and (y) provide to Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or
delivery thereof (and in any event within 24 hours) copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent by or provided to the Company,
its Subsidiaries or Representatives from any Person that describes any of the
terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal. In connection with such
notice, the Company shall indicate the identity of such Person and shall
provide a copy of any such expression of interest, proposal or offer that was
received. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall notify Parent
orally and in writing (which may be by email) if the Company determines to
begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section 7.03(d)_, prior to
providing any such information or engaging in any such discussions or
negotiations.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.03_, if at
any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time: (i) the Company has received an
unsolicited, bona fide

 



      
 

 



 

and written Acquisition Proposal providing for the acquisition of 100% of the
outstanding Shares or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case, whether by merger,
consolidation, acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise, from a third
party; (ii) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this
_Section 7.03_ (excluding a breach that is unintentional and does not
adversely affect the parties ability to consummate the Transactions); (iii)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Company Financial Advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal;
and (iv) after consultation with its outside counsel, the Company Board
determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the Stockholders under
Applicable Law, then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal and such Persons Representatives and (B) participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and such
Persons Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that
the Company (x) shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to
such Person without first entering into a confidentiality agreement containing
limitations on the use and disclosure of all non-public information furnished
to such Person by or on behalf of any of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
"standstill" provisions, in each case no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement"_ ), and (y) shall promptly provide to Parent any
non-public information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries provided to
such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if

 



 

(i) (A) the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide and written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.03_ (excluding
a breach that is unintentional and does not adversely affect the parties
ability to consummate the Transactions), which the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and the Company Financial
Advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after giving effect to all of the
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by Parent
pursuant to _clause (2)_ below, _and_ (B) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the
Company Board to the Stockholders under Applicable Law, _or_

 



 

(ii) the Company Board determines (other than with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal) in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take the actions specified in clauses (y) and (z) below would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the
Stockholders under Applicable Law,

 



 

 _then_ , the Company Board may at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time
(y) effect a Change of Board Recommendation _and/or_ (z) in the case of
_clause (i)_ above, terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
provisions of _Section 10.01(e)_ and _Section 10.03(b)_ to enter into
definitive agreements with respect to such Superior Proposal (the "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreements_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing _clause
(z)_ (and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing

 



      
 

 



 

 _clause (z)_ shall be void and of no force or effect) _unless_ the Company
complies with the provisions of _Section 10.01(e)_ and _Section 10.03(b)_;
and _provided_ , _further_ that the Company Board may not withdraw, modify or
amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent pursuant
to the foregoing _clause (y)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing _clause (z) unless_:

 



 

(1) the Company shall not have breached this _Section 7.03_ (excluding a
breach that is unintentional and does not adversely affect the parties
ability to consummate the Transactions); and

 



 

(2) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of the Companys
intention to take any action permitted under _clause (y)_ or _(z)_ above,
which written notice shall, in the case of _clause (i)_ above, specify the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the
identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have
contemporaneously provided to Parent final, execution copies of the relevant
Alternative Acquisition Agreements; _and_

 



 

(3) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating this
Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, during the Notice Period,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as the Parent may (in its sole discretion) determine to make so that
such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal or, in the
case of _clause (ii)_ above, the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such a
Change of Board Recommendation would not be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties owed by the Company Board to the Stockholders under Applicable Law.

 



 

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with
the requirements of this _Section 7.03(e)_ with respect to such new written
notice, except that references to the four Business Day period in _clause (2)_
above shall be deemed to be reference to a two Business Day period; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that such new written notice shall in no event
shorten the original Notice Period in respect of a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this _Section 7.03_ shall prohibit the Company, or the Company
Board, directly or indirectly through any Representative, from disclosing in
the Schedule 14D-9 or otherwise factual information regarding the business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the
identity of the party making such Acquisition Proposal or the material terms
of such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company has in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, determined that such information,
facts, identity or terms is required to be disclosed under Applicable Law or
that failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board under Applicable Law and, _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if such disclosure does not reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation or
has the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company
Board Recommendation,

 



      
 

 



 

such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of Board Recommendation and
Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in
_Section 10.01(f)_. So long as the Company and its Representatives have
otherwise complied with this _Section 7.03_, none of the foregoing shall
prohibit the Company and its Representatives, at any time prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, from contacting any Persons or group of Persons that have
made an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely to
request the clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as to
determine whether the Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected
to result in, a Superior Proposal, and any such actions shall not be a breach
of this _Section 7.03_.

 



 

Section 7.04 _Access to Information_. Subject to Applicable Law, from the date
of this Agreement until the Effective Time, upon reasonable notice and during
normal business hours, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, (a) give Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to
the offices, properties, books, contracts and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (b) furnish to Parent and its Representatives such financial and
operating data and other information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their properties and businesses as Parent and its
Representatives may reasonably request and (c) instruct the Representatives of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate with Parent in its investigation
of the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.04_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be
required to provide access to any information or documents which would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company (i) breach any Contract with any Person,
(ii) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege held by any of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, (iii) violate Applicable Law or (iv) unreasonably
interfere with the business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(it being agreed that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that
it is withholding such information or documents pursuant to _clauses (i)_
through _(iv)_ above, and thereafter the Company and Parent shall reasonably
cooperate to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to cause a breach, waiver, violation or interference).
Any investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.04_ shall be conducted in such
manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall
not have access to personnel records of the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or
other information, in each case to the extent the disclosure thereof would
result in the violation of Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.05 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Takeover Statutes_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under Applicable Law and rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of all Shares from the NYSE and the
deregistration of all Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than 10 days after the
Closing Date.

 



 

(b) If any Anti-Takeover Law is or may become applicable to the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions, the Company and the Company Board
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such
Transactions may be consummated

 



      
 

 



 

as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Anti-Takeover Law
on such Transactions to the greatest extent permissible under such Anti-
Takeover Law.

 



 

Section 7.06 _Payoff Letters_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent no later than three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date customary payoff letters with respect to (i) the
satisfaction and release of all of the Company and its Subsidiaries
liabilities and obligations (including all indebtedness for borrowed money, if
any, of the Company and its Subsidiaries outstanding as of the Closing, but
excluding any indemnification obligations that survive termination) under the
Contracts set forth in _Section 7.06_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
" _Loan Documents_ "), (ii) the termination of the Loan Documents and (iii)
the release of all Liens held pursuant to or otherwise related to the Loan
Documents.

 



 

Section 7.07 _Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time,
the Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the " _Compensation
Committee_ ") shall cause each Employee Plan pursuant to which consideration
is payable to any officer, director or employee who is a holder of any
security of the Company to be approved by the Compensation Committee
(comprised solely of "independent directors") in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
and satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in
Rule 14d-10(d) of the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 7.08 _Partnership Units_. Prior to the consummation of the Offer, the
Company shall not permit any Person that is a party to the Exchange Agreement
to exchange such Persons units of Athlon Holdings LP (" _Partnership Units_
") for shares of Common Stock. Except where Parent has exercised its right to
purchase Partnership Units pursuant to one or more Non-Conversion Agreements,
immediately following consummation of the Offer, the Company shall take all
actions as are necessary to cause all Partnership Units (other than those
Partnership Units held by the Company) to be exchanged for shares of Common
Stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreement (the " _Exchange_ "). Except where
Parent has exercised its right to purchase Partnership Units pursuant to one
or more Non-Conversion Agreements, to the extent the Exchange is not effected
as contemplated by the preceding sentence, the Exchange shall be deemed to
have been effected immediately prior to consummation of the Merger, whereupon
all Partnership Units (other than those units held by the Company) shall cease
to be outstanding.

such objections or lawsuits or other Proceedings (or threatened lawsuits or
other Proceedings) so as to permit consummation of the Transactions as soon as
reasonably practicable, including becoming subject to, consenting to or

required to take any such actions that would reasonably be expected to impair
the benefits of the Transactions to Parent; and _provided further_ , that the
obligations of the parties under this _Section 8.01(d)_ shall be conditioned

the Company and do not reveal material, non-public information regarding the
other parties or the Transactions.

 



 

Section 8.03 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

Companys request as an officer or director of any other Person, with respect
to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the
request of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries at any time prior to the

which they were acting in such capacity would have been permitted to
indemnify, advance expenses to and hold harmless such individuals by
Applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation or
advancement of expenses or indemnification for acts or omissions occurring

of the current and former directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any of their predecessors and the heirs, executors, trustees,
fiduciaries and administrators of such officer or director (each, a " _D andO
Indemnitee_"), as provided in the certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational or governing documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or in any Contract, in each case as applicable to a DandO
Indemnitee, shall survive the Offer and the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. After the Effective Time,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to, fulfill and honor such obligations to the maximum extent that the Company
or its Subsidiary would have been permitted to fulfill and honor them by
Applicable Law. In addition, for a period of six years following the Effective
Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or
comparable organizational or governing documents) of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, advancement
of expenses and exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents)
of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and during such six-year period, such provisions, as applicable to a DandO
Indemnitee, shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
respect, except as required by Applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premiums for a non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers

reporting or discovery period of up to six years from and after the Effective
Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to
the Effective Time from the Companys current DandO Insurance carriers or one or
more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current DandO Insurance carriers with respect to directors and officers
insurance policies in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the DandO

 



      
 

 



 

Insurance; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company pay
aggregate premiums for such "tail" insurance policies in excess of the amount
set forth in _Section 8.03(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided
further_ , that if the aggregate premiums payable for such "tail" insurance
policies exceed such amount, the Company shall obtain "tail" insurance
policies with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 8.03_ shall survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee,
and nothing in this Agreement shall affect any indemnification rights that any
such DandO Indemnitee may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational or governing documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any Contract, in each case as applicable to a DandO Indemnitee,
or Applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the obligations under this _Section 8.03_ shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee without the consent
of such DandO Indemnitee.

 



 

(e) The rights of each DandO Indemnitee under this _Section 8.03_ shall be in
addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents)
of any of the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries, or under any Applicable Law or under any Contract of any DandO
Indemnitee with any of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall
consolidate or merge with any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other Person,
then in each case proper provision shall be made so that the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable),
or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 8.03_.

 



 

Section 8.04 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the
Company and the Company Board (or an appropriate committee of non-employee
directors thereof) shall take such actions (including adopting a resolution
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC) as are required to cause
the disposition of Company Securities in connection with the Transactions by
each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt from Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

(a) For a period of at least one year following the Closing Date, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to,
provide each Company Employee who continues to be employed by the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries (individually a " _Company Employee_ "
and collectively the " _Company Employees_ ") with (i) base salary (or wages)
and cash bonus opportunities (excluding any equity compensation) that are no
less favorable than the base salaries and cash bonus opportunities (excluding
any equity

to the Effective Time, (ii) pension and welfare benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided by the Company and its

(b) Parent further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to, grant
all of the Company Employees credit for any service with the Company or its
Subsidiaries earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for eligibility and vesting
purposes and (ii) for purposes of vacation accrual and severance benefit
determinations under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement that may be established or that is maintained by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date
(each, a " _Parent Plan_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall
not be recognized or credited to the extent that such recognition would result
in a duplication of benefits provided to the Company Employee or to the extent
that such service was not recognized under any similar Employee Plan of the
Company.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 8.05_ shall not (i) confer upon any
Person (including any current or former employees) other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, (ii) be construed as in any way
modifying or amending the provisions of any Employee Plan, (iii) require
Parent to continue any Employee Plan or be construed to prevent or limit

and Cashed Out Compensatory Awards and for the termination of the Company
Stock Plan at the Effective Time as set forth in _Section 4.05_.

notify the other of any stockholder litigation against it or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions and shall keep the other
reasonably informed regarding any such stockholder litigation. Each of Parent
and the Company shall give the other reasonable opportunity to consult with it
regarding the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation and
shall give due consideration to the other partys views with respect to such
stockholder litigation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the Company shall not settle or enter into any negotiations or
settlement of any such litigation without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

 



 

Section 8.08 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of (i) any written notice or
other communication received by any of the Company or its Subsidiaries from
any Person

 



      
 

 



 

alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions, if the failure to obtain such consent would reasonably
be expected to materially impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions
or have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any Proceeding commenced or,
to the Companys Knowledge, threatened that may materially impede or delay the
consummation of the Transactions, or that make allegations that, if true,
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect; (iii) any inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of the Company contained herein at any time during the term hereof if
such inaccuracy would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions
set forth in _clauses 2(a)_ , _(b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ of _ANNEX I_ to fail
to be satisfied at the Initial Expiration Time or the Expiration Time; and
(iv) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder if such failure
would reasonably be expected to cause the condition set forth in _clause 2(e)_
of _ANNEX I_ to fail to be satisfied at the Initial Expiration Time or the
Expiration Time. For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 8.08(a)_ shall not affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate
the Offer or the remedies available to Parent and Acquisition Sub hereunder.

 



 

(b) Parent shall promptly notify the Company of (i) any written notice or
other communication received by Parent or Acquisition Sub from any Person

with the Transactions, if the failure to obtain such consent would reasonably
be expected to materially impede or delay the consummation of the Transactions
or have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) any Proceeding commenced or,
to Parents Knowledge, threatened that may materially impede or delay the
consummation of the Transactions; (iii) any inaccuracy of any representation
or warranty of Parent or Acquisition Sub contained herein at any time during
the term hereof if such inaccuracy would reasonably be expected to materially
impede or delay Parent and Acquisition Subs ability to consummate the
Transactions; and (iv) any failure of either Parent or Acquisition Sub to
comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder if such failure would reasonably be expected to
materially impede or delay Parent and Acquisition Subs ability to consummate
the Transactions. For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 8.08(b)_ shall not affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty of Parent or Acquisition Sub set forth in this
Agreement or the remedies available to the Company hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.09 _Tax Matters_.

respects in compliance with all Tax withholding and remitting provisions of
applicable laws, (iv) properly reserve (and reflect such reserve in their
books and records and financial statements), for all Taxes payable by them for
which no Tax Return is due prior to the Effective Time in a manner consistent
with past practice; and (v) promptly notify Parent of any federal, state,
local or foreign income or franchise

 



      
 

 



 

and any other suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding or audit
(collectively, " _Tax Actions_ ") pending or threatened against or with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax
matter, including Tax liabilities and refund claims.

 



 

(b) Before the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
terminate all Tax Sharing Agreements (other than the Tax Receivable Agreement)
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party such that there are
no further liabilities thereunder, other than any Tax Sharing Agreements
solely among the Company and any of its Subsidiaries.

ARTICLE X _

Merger and the Transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time, only as follows:

 



 

(a) by mutual written agreement of each of the Company and Parent;

 



 

(b) by either the Company or Parent if the Offer Acceptance Time has not
occurred on or before January 31, 2015 (which date shall automatically,
without further action of any party, be extended to March 31, 2015 if all of
the Offer Conditions, other than the Offer Conditions set forth in _clause
2(g)_ or _2(i)_ of _ANNEX I_ , have been satisfied or shall be capable of
being satisfied at such time) (the latest such date, the " _End Date_ ");
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 10.01(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of any
provision of this Agreement results in the failure of the Offer Acceptance
Time to have occurred by such time;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) by either Parent or the Company if a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued any Order or other Applicable Law, in each
case, which has become final and non-appealable and which permanently makes
illegal, restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits or prevents the acceptance
for payment of, or payment for, Shares pursuant to the Offer or consummation
of the Offer or the Merger;

 



 

(d) by either Parent or the Company if the Offer shall have expired without
the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer; _provided_ that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(d)_
shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this
Agreement results in the failure of the acceptance for payment of Shares
pursuant to the Offer;

 



 

(e) prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, by the Company, if the Company Board
shall have determined to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal to the extent permitted by, and in accordance
with _Section 7.03(e)_; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be permitted
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.01(e)_ unless the
Company shall have made the payment of the Company Termination Fee to Parent
pursuant to _Section 10.03(b)(iii)_.

 



 

(f) prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, by Parent if the Company, the Company
Board or any committee thereof shall have effected a Change of Board
Recommendation;

 



 

(g) prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, by Parent if (i) any representation or
warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate or
shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this
Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date) such that any condition set
forth in _clause 2(a)_ , _(b)_ , _(c)_ , or _(d)_ of _ANNEX I_ would not be
satisfied, or (ii) any of the covenants or obligations of the Company
contained in this Agreement shall have been breached such that the condition
set forth in _clause 2(e)_ of _ANNEX I_ would not be satisfied; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if an inaccuracy or breach is curable by the Company during
the 30-day period after Parent notifies the Company in writing of the
existence of such inaccuracy or breach (the " _Company Cure Period_ "), then
Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section 10.01(g)_ as a
result of such inaccuracy or breach if such breach is cured during the Company
Cure Period and if not so cured prior to the earlier of (A) the expiration of
the Company Cure Period and (B) the End Date unless the Company is no longer
continuing to exercise reasonable best efforts to cure such inaccuracy or
breach; _provided, further_ , that Parent may not terminate this Agreement
under this _Section 10.01(g)_ if it is then in breach in any material respect
of this Agreement;

 



 

(h) prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, by the Company, if (i) any
representation or warranty of Parent or Acquisition Sub contained in this
Agreement shall be inaccurate in any material respect or shall have become
inaccurate in any material respect as of a date subsequent to the date of this
Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date) or (ii) any of the covenants or
obligations of Parent or Acquisition Sub contained in this Agreement shall
have been breached in any material respect, in each of _clauses (i)_ and
_(ii)_ , if such inaccuracy or breach prevents or would reasonably be expected
to prevent Parent or Acquisition Sub from consummating the Transactions;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if an inaccuracy or breach is curable by

 



      
 

 



 

Parent or Acquisition Sub during the 30-day period after the Company notifies
Parent in writing of the existence of such inaccuracy or breach (the " _Parent
Cure Period_ "), then the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 10.01(h)_ as a result of such inaccuracy or breach if such breach is
cured during the Parent Cure Period and if not so cured prior to the earlier
of (A) the expiration of the Parent Cure Period and (B) the End Date unless
Parent or Acquisition Sub, as applicable, is no longer continuing to exercise
reasonable best efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 10.01(h)_ if it is then in breach in any material respect of this
Agreement;

 



 

(i) the party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.01_ (other than pursuant to _Section 10.01(a)_) shall give a notice of
such termination to the other party specifying the provisions hereof pursuant
to which such termination is made and the basis therefor described in
reasonable detail.

 



 

Section 10.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 10.01_, then this Agreement shall become void and of no
effect without liability of any party (or any Representative, stockholder or
Affiliate of such party) to the other party hereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that: (a) none of the parties hereto shall be relieved of any damages or
liability arising from any fraud or willful and material breach by such party
of any provision of this Agreement; and (b) the parties hereto shall, in all
events, remain bound by and continue to be subject to the provisions set forth
in the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section 8.02,_ this _Section 10.02_,
_Section 10.03_ and _ARTICLE XI_, all of which shall survive any termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01_. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "willful and material breach" shall mean a material breach that
is a consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching party with the actual
Knowledge that the taking of such act would, or would be reasonably expected
to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.03 _Expenses; Termination Fees_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 10.03_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the preparation, negotiation and performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Offer and the Merger are
consummated.

 



 

(b) If, but only if, this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)_ or _Section
10.01(d)_ and (B) (x) an Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company or
the Stockholders after the date hereof or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition
Proposal, (y) such Acquisition Proposal or intention to make an Acquisition
Proposal was publicly disclosed prior to the time of such termination and an
Acquisition Proposal remained pending as of the date of such termination, and
(z) within twelve months of the termination of this Agreement, (1) the Company
enters into a definitive agreement for the consummation of an Acquisition
Proposal or (2) an Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then the Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee within two
Business Days of the earliest to occur of such events ( _provided_ , _however_
, that for

 



      
 

 



 

purposes of this _Section 10.03(b)(i)_, the references to "20% or more" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"more than 50%");

 



 

(ii) (x) by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)_ or _Section 10.01(d)_
and (y) the Company Board or any committee thereof made a Change of Board
Recommendation, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the
Company Termination Fee concurrently with such termination if the termination
takes place on a Business Day, and on the next Business Day if the termination
takes place on a day other than a Business Day;

 



 

(iii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.01(e)_, then the Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee concurrently
with such termination if the termination takes place on a Business Day, and on
the next Business Day if the termination takes place on a day other than a
Business Day; or

 



 

(iv) by Parent pursuant to _Section 10.01(f)_, then the Company shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee promptly, and in any
event not more than two Business Days following such termination.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 10.03_ are an integral part of the
Transactions, (ii) without these agreements, Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company would not enter into this Agreement and (iii) any amount payable
pursuant to this _Section 10.03_ is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Acquisition Sub
in the circumstances in which such amount is payable. The parties hereto
acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the Company be required to
pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(d) Any amounts payable by the Company pursuant to this _Section 10.03_ shall
be paid by wire transfer of same day funds in accordance with this _Section
10.03_ to an account designated by Parent, _provided_ that such payments can
be delayed until the Business Day after the day on which Parent provides the
Company with wiring instructions and such delay will not give rise to a breach
of the Companys obligations under this _Section 10.03_. If the Company fails
to pay when due any amount payable under this _Section 10.03_ or any portion
of such amount, then the Company shall pay Parent interest on such overdue
amount (for the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is
actually paid to Parent in full) at the rate of interest per annum equal to
the "Prime Rate" as set forth on the date such payment became past due in _The
Wall Street Journal_ "Money Rates" column, plus 300 basis points and, if in
order to obtain such payment, Parent or Acquisition Sub commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company for any amount payable under this
_Section 10.03_ or any portion of such amount, the Company shall pay to
Parent and Acquisition Sub their reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to
_Section 10.02_, in the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 10.01(b)_, _Section 10.01(d)_, _Section 10.01(e)_ or _Section
10.01(f)_, the Company Termination Fee is payable

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this _Section 10.03_ and the Company has paid the Company
Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with this _Section 10.03_, Parents
receipt of the Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to _Section
10.03(b)_ and the payment of any amounts due pursuant to _Section 10.03(d)_
shall (other than in respect of fraud or willful and material breach of any
provision of this Agreement) be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and
Acquisition Sub against the Company for any losses or damages arising from or
relating to this Agreement, any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Transactions to
be consummated, and none of the Company Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not impair the
rights of Parent to obtain injunctive relief pursuant to _Section 11.02_
prior to any termination of this Agreement, including to prevent or object to
a purported termination of this Agreement by the Company.

privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

shall not relieve Parent or Acquisition Sub of its obligations hereunder or

any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in connection
with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters
contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner
authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, and
covenants not to assert or plead any objection it may now or hereafter have to

court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 



 

Section 11.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING

HEREOF.

 



 

Section 11.09 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have
any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or
written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic mail transmission
(including in portable document format (pdf) or otherwise) or by facsimile

Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and each of the documents, instruments and agreements delivered in
connection with the Transactions, including each of the Exhibits and the
Company Disclosure Schedule, constitute the entire agreement among the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement or the application thereof is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions are not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate

_Agreement_ "), Acquisition Sub shall not be obligated to accept for payment,
and, subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule 14e-l(c)
promulgated under the Exchange Act), shall not be obligated to pay for, or may
delay the acceptance for payment of or payment for, any validly tendered
Shares pursuant to the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid
for), if immediately prior to the Expiration Date, there shall not have been
validly tendered (not including any Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures that were not actually delivered prior to the Expiration
Date) and not validly withdrawn that number of Shares that would represent one
Share more than one-half (1/2) of the sum of:

 



 

(a) all Shares then outstanding, and

 



 

(b) all Shares that the Company may be required to issue under the Exchange
Agreement and upon the vesting (including vesting solely as a result of the
consummation of the Offer), conversion, settlement or exercise of all then
outstanding warrants, options, benefit plans, obligations or securities
convertible or exchangeable into Shares, or other rights to acquire or be
issued Shares (including all then outstanding Company Compensatory Awards),
regardless of the conversion or exercise price or other terms and conditions
thereof (such condition in this _clause (1)_ being the " _Minimum Condition_
").

 



 

For purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition has been satisfied,
Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to include or exclude for purposes
of their determination thereof Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures.

 



 

(2) Notwithstanding any other term or provision of the Offer or the Agreement,
and in addition to (and not in limitation of) Acquisition Subs rights to
extend and amend the Offer (subject to the provisions of the Agreement), and
subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, Acquisition Sub
shall not be required to accept for payment or pay for any Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer if at the Expiration Date (i) the Minimum Condition has
not been satisfied, or (ii) any of the following conditions shall not be
satisfied or have been waived by Parent and Acquisition Sub:

 



 

(a) the representations and warranties made by the Company contained in
_Section 5.07(b)_ and the second sentence of _Section 5.05(f)_ of the
Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of the
Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of the
Expiration Date;

 



 

(b) the representations and warranties made by the Company contained in
_Section 5.05(a)_ and the first sentence of _Section 5.05(b)_ of the
Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of the
Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of the
Expiration Date (except to the extent

 



      
 

 



 

that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks of a specified
earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty need only be true
and correct as of such specified earlier date), except for any failures to be
so true and correct that, individually or in the aggregate, are _de minimis_
(it being understood that any failures to be true and correct shall be deemed
to be " _de minimis_ " if and only if the Companys fully diluted
capitalization as of the applicable determination date does not exceed the
Companys fully diluted capitalization set forth in _Section 5.05(a)_ and the
first sentence of _Section 5.05(b)_ by more than 0.25% in the aggregate);

 



 

(c) the representations and warranties made by the Company contained in
_Section 5.01(a)_ (solely as it applies to the due incorporation and valid
existence of the Company), _Section 5.02_, _Section 5.04_ (solely as it
applies to the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company),
_Section 5.20_ and _Section 5.22_ of the Agreement shall be true and correct
in all material respects as of the date of the Agreement and as of the
Expiration Date as though made on and as of the Expiration Date (except to the
extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks of a
specified earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty need
only be true and correct as of such specified earlier date), without giving
effect to any "Company Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality
qualifications, or any similar qualifications or limitations contained or
incorporated directly or indirectly in such representations and warranties;

 



 

(d) all other representations and warranties made by the Company in the
Agreement (other than those referred to in _clauses 2(a)_ , _(b)_ and _(c)_
above) shall have been true and correct in all respects as of the date of the
Agreement and shall be true and correct in all respects as of the Expiration
Date as if made on the Expiration Date (except to the extent that any such
representation and warranty expressly speaks of a specified earlier date, in
which case such representation and warranty need only be true and correct in
all respects as of such specified earlier date), except where the failure of
such representations and warranties to be so true and correct, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect and without giving effect to any "Company
Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality qualifications, or any similar
qualifications or limitations contained or incorporated directly or indirectly
in such representations and warranties;

 



 

(e) the Company shall have complied with or performed in all material respects
all covenants and obligations that the Company is required to comply with or
to perform at or prior to the Expiration Date;

 



 

(f) Parent shall have received a certificate executed on behalf of the Company
by its Chief Executive Officer to the effect that the conditions set forth in
_clauses (2)(a)_ , _(b)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ and _(e)_ above have been duly
satisfied;

 



 

(g) The waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the
consummation of the Offer under the HSR Act shall have expired or been
terminated;

 



      
 

 



 

(h) since the date of the Agreement, there shall not have occurred any Company
Material Adverse Effect that is continuing;

 



 

(i) no Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) of a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction or other Applicable Law shall be in effect
which makes illegal, restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits or prevents the
acceptance for payment of, or payment for, Shares pursuant to the Offer or
consummation of the Offer or the Merger; and

 



 

(j) the Agreement shall not have been validly terminated in accordance with
_ARTICLE X_.

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Acquisition
Sub and may be waived by Parent and Acquisition Sub, in whole or in part, at
any time and from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent and
Acquisition Sub; _provided_ , _however_ , the Minimum Condition may be waived
by Parent and Acquisition Sub only with the prior written consent of the
Company, which may be granted or withheld in the Companys sole discretion.
The failure by Parent or Acquisition Sub at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.

 



 

Each capitalized term used but not defined in this _ANNEX I_ has the meaning
ascribed to such term in the Agreement.
