ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

Section 2.01 _The Merger_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the " _Merger_
") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the
separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be
the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a direct
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of _Article 9_ , the closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. EDT in New York City at the
offices of Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel LLP, 1177 Avenue of the Americas,
New York, New York 10036 as soon as possible, but in any event no later than
two (2) Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in _Article 9_
(other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver
of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent
permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such
conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other date
as Parent and the Company may mutually agree in writing. The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_
".



 

9 (c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the " _Effective Time_ ") as the
certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or
at such later time as may be agreed upon by the parties hereto and specified
in the certificate of merger).

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of
the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 

Section 2.02 _Conversion of Shares_ _._ At the Effective Time:

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.02(b)_, _Section 2.04_ or
_Section 2.05_, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $9.80 in cash
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration paid in accordance with _Section
2.03_, without interest.

 

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and each share of Company Stock held by any
Subsidiary of the Company shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
preferences as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.03 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares
of Company Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Stock (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "). As of or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed,
the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.02_.
Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later than five (5) Business Days
after the Effective Time), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange
Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock as of the Effective
Time a letter of transmittal (which will be in customary form and reviewed by
the Company prior to delivery thereof) and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.

 



 

10 (b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share.
Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate
or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Upon payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 2_ , each
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be canceled.

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this _Article 2_.

 

(e) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Company Stock twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this _Section 2.03_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not
be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock
two (2) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately
prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.



 

11 (f) Any portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration made available to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.06_ in respect of any Dissenting
Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

(g) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including
those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the exchange of shares for the
Merger Consideration.

 

Section 2.04 _Stock Options and Restricted Shares_.

 

(a) By virtue of the Merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Stock under any employee stock option or compensation plan or
arrangement of the Company that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested (a " _Company Stock
Option_ ") shall become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to,
and then shall be canceled at, the Effective Time, and the holder thereof
shall, subject to _Section 2.08_, be entitled to receive, from the Surviving
Corporation (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to such
holder), an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of
(1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share of Company
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, with the aggregate amount of such
payment rounded up to the nearest cent, and (ii) the total number of shares
of Company Stock subject to such fully vested and exercisable Company Stock
Option as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Option Consideration_ "). The Option Consideration shall be paid in a lump
sum promptly after the Effective Time (but no later than five (5) Business
Days after the Effective Time). In the event that the exercise price of any
Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such Company Stock Option shall be canceled and have no further force or
effect. As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall provide written notice to each person who is a holder of
Company Stock Options describing the treatment of and, if applicable, payment
for such Company Stock Options pursuant to this _Section 2.04(a)_ and
providing instructions for obtaining payment for such Company Stock Options.

(b) By virtue of the Merger, each restricted share of Company Stock, which is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Restricted
Share_ "), other than any such Company Restricted Share that is a Rollover
Share (for the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the Agreement, Rollover Shares shall not be entitled to receive any
Restricted Stock Consideration or Merger Consideration, as applicable), shall,
to the extent not vested, vest as of the Effective Time, and at the Effective
Time, each holder of such Company Restricted Share shall, subject to _Section
2.08_, be entitled to receive, from the Surviving Corporation (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to such holders), an amount in
cash equal to the Merger Consideration in cancellation of each share of
Company Restricted Share previously held (the " _Restricted Stock
Consideration_ "). The Restricted Stock Consideration shall be paid in a lump
sum promptly after the Effective Time (but no later than five (5) Business
Days after the Effective Time). As soon as practicable following the execution
of this Agreement, the Company shall provide written notice to each person who
is a holder of Company Restricted Shares describing the treatment of and, if
applicable, payment for such



 

12  Company Restricted Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.04(b)_ and providing
instructions for obtaining payment for such Company Restricted Shares. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Rollover Shares_ " shall include the Company
Restricted Shares that are subject to cancellation in exchange for membership
units of Parent, pursuant to those certain mutually binding rollover
commitment letters entered into by and between the Company and those other
parties appearing on the signature pages thereto (i) as of the date hereof and
(ii) as may be entered into, subject to the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
subsequent to the date hereof (collectively, the " _Rollover Commitment
Letters_ "), pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth therein.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as are
reasonably necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 2.04_, including, without limitation, (i) adopting appropriate
resolutions, (ii) preventing the commencement of any new offering periods
under the Companys 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and (iii) taking all
actions necessary to terminate the Company Stock Plans.

Section 2.05 _Treatment of Warrants_. On or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cancel each warrant to
purchase Company Stock that is listed on _Section 2.05_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Warrants_ ").

Section 2.06 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.03_, shares
of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares of Company Stock canceled in accordance with _Section
2.02(b)_) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised
appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law
(such shares being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ "
until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such
holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares)
shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but
instead shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that if,
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses
such holders right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law or
if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of Delaware Law, such shares of
Company Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.02(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender
of such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such
Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent
prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
shares of Company Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other
demand, notice, instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to Delaware Law that relate to such demand, and Parent shall
have the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands under the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, or to the
extent required by Applicable Law, the Company shall not make any payment with
respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

Section 2.07 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Stock
shall be changed into a



 

13  different number of shares or a different class (including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record date during
such period), the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

Section 2.08 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article 2_ such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If
the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be,
so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the Exchange
Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such
deduction and withholding.

 

Section 2.09 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent may reasonably require, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this _Article 2_.

ARTICLE 3

3.01_ shall affect in any way the indemnification obligations provided for in

be amended to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time and as so amended shall be the bylaws

Delaware Law. Nothing in this _Section 3.02_ shall affect in any way the

14 ARTICLE 4

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Subject to _Section 11.05_, except (x) as disclosed in any Company SEC
Document filed after January 31, 2009 and before the date of this Agreement
(the " _Filed Company SEC Documents_ "), other than disclosure in such Company
SEC Documents (as defined below) referred to in the "Risk Factors" and
"Forward Looking Statements" sections thereof or any other disclosures in the
Filed Company SEC Documents which are forward-looking in nature, or (y) as set
forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants
to Parent that:

 

Section 4.01 _Corporate Existence and Power_. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals
required to own, lease and operate its properties and assets it purports to
own and to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals the absence of which have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Where applicable as a legal concept,
the Company is duly qualified to do business and in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties it
owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or in
good standing that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
heretofore made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or other organizational documents, of
the Company as amended and in effect as of the date hereof and is not in
violation in any material respect of any of the provisions contained in such
documents.

Section 4.02 _Corporate Authorization_. 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and each other instrument required hereby to be executed and delivered by it
at the Closing and the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder
and consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are
within the Companys corporate powers and authority and, except for the
required approval of the Companys stockholders in connection with the
consummation of the Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Stock is the only vote of the holders of any of
the Companys capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of
the Merger (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). This Agreement and each
other instrument required hereby to be executed and delivered by the Company
has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors rights generally and general
principles of equity whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).



 

15 (b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Companys Board of Directors or
an authorized committee thereof has by the unanimous vote of all members of
the Companys Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are
fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii)
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and the
performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder, and
declared its advisability in accordance with Delaware Law, and (iii)
unanimously resolved, subject to _Section 6.03(b)_, to recommend approval and
adoption of this Agreement by its stockholders (such recommendation, the "
_Company Board Recommendation_ "), and directed that such matter be submitted
for consideration of the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

 

Section 4.03 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action, consent,
approval, license, permit, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration, notice or filing with, any Governmental Authority or any stock
market or stock exchange on which shares of Company Stock are listed for
trading, other than (i) the filing of a certificate of merger with respect to
the Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate corresponding
documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company
is qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements
of the HSR Act and any other applicable foreign antitrust law, (iii) filings
required under, and compliance with any applicable requirements of, the 1933
Act and 1934 Act, and any other applicable state or federal securities laws,
(iv) such consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations and filings as may be required under applicable state securities
laws, (iv) any filings required by, and any approvals required under, the
rules and policies of The NASDAQ Stock Market and (v) such other consents,
approvals, licenses, permits, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations, notices and filings, the absence of which would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 4.04 _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or of the charter, bylaws or
other organizational document of any of the Subsidiaries of the Company, in
each case as in effect as of the date hereof, (ii) assuming compliance with
the matters referred to in _Section 4.03_, contravene, conflict with or
result in a violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, (iii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in _Section 4.03_, require
any consent, waiver or other action by any Person under, constitute a default,
or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation,

owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so

securities or ownership interests). There are no issued, reserved for issuance

"), other than any of the foregoing owned or held by the Company and/or a

therein, including those that the Company may file after the date hereof
until the Closing, the " _Company SEC Documents_ ").

form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933
Act, 1934 Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as the case may be, and the
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Company
SEC Documents.

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Document filed
pursuant to the 1933 Act or 1934 Act did not, or will not at the time they are
filed, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or

included in reports under the 1934 Act, is made known to the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of the Company by others within those
entities. Neither the Company nor, to the Companys knowledge, the Companys
independent registered public accounting firm, has identified or been made
aware of "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as defined by
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) in the design or operation of
the Companys internal controls and procedures which could reasonably
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data, in each case which has not been subsequently
remediated. To the Companys knowledge, there is no fraud, whether or not
material, that involves the Companys management or other employees who have a

1934 Act) and (iii) complied as to form in all material respects with

and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such
financial statements included in or incorporated by reference in the Company
SEC Documents.

in all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act. The
representations and warranties contained in this _Section 4.10_ will not
apply to statements or omissions included or incorporated by reference in the
Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 based upon information supplied by
Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives

prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any fact or event relating to the
Company or any of its Affiliates which should be set forth in an amendment or

Section 5.06 _Information Supplied_. The information supplied by Parent for

Company of such fact or event.

 

Section 5.07 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no

Governmental Authority or arbitrator, that, if determined or
resolved adversely in accordance with the plaintiffs demands, would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.08 _Parent Financial Capability_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (i) a
fully-executed commitment letter, dated as of June 23, 2010, by and among

N.A., and The Private Bank (the " _Debt Financing Commitment_ "), including
the term sheets attached thereto, pursuant to which the lenders set forth
therein have agreed to lend, subject to the conditions contained therein, the
amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ "), and (ii) fully-executed
Equity Financing Commitments by and between Parent and each of: (i) ZM

and Rosemont Solebury Coinvestment Fund (Offshore), L.P. (dated as of June 23,
2010), true and correct copies of which are set forth on  _Exhibit C_ hereto
(the " _Equity Financing Commitment_ " and together with the Debt Financing
Commitment, the " _Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to

 



 

37  which the Equity Providers (as defined therein) have committed to invest,
subject to the conditions contained therein, the amount set forth therein (the
" _Equity Financing_ " and together with the Debt Financing, and each for the
purposes of consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
" _Financing_ ").

 

(b) None of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified except to
the extent permitted by this Agreement, and, as of the date hereof, the
respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and as of the date of this Agreement,
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,

Agreement, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and are
legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent and the other parties thereto.
All commitment fees and other fees required to be paid pursuant to each of
the Financing Commitments have been paid in full or will be duly paid in full
when due. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to
the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in
or contemplated by the Financing Commitments. The Financing Commitments set
forth the entire agreement of the parties thereto with respect to the
Financing. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 4.05_ and _Section 4.08_, the aggregate proceeds to
be disbursed pursuant to the agreements contemplated by the Financing
Commitments, if funded, will be sufficient for Parent and the Surviving
Corporation to pay the Merger Consideration, the Option Consideration, the
Restricted Stock Consideration and all fees and expenses related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement,
Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the

Parent and Merger Subsidiary at the Closing as contemplated in the Financing
Commitments.

 

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary is, as of the date hereof, aware of
any fact, occurrence or condition that makes any of the assumptions or
statements set forth in any Financing Commitment inaccurate in any material
respect or that would cause the commitments provided in any Financing
Commitment to be terminated or ineffective or any of the conditions contained
therein not to be met.

(d) The equity investment by the Equity Providers under the Equity Financing
Commitment is not subject to any condition other than the fulfillment in
accordance with the terms hereof of the conditions to Parents and Merger
Subsidiarys obligations to consummate the Merger set forth in _Section 9.01_
and _Section 9.02_. 

Section 5.09 _Operations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary_. Each of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated hereby and, prior to the Effective Time, neither
Parent nor Merger Subsidiary has engaged in any other business activities
and/or incurred any liabilities or obligations other than as contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 5.10 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, assuming (a) satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions to Parents obligations to consummate the Merger
as set forth herein and (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in _Article 4_ hereof (for such purposes, such
representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all respects



 

38  without giving effect to any Companys knowledge, materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualification or exception), (i) immediately after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the closing of
any financing to be obtained by Parent or any of its Affiliates in order to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Surviving
Corporation shall, as of such date, be able to pay its debts as they become
due and shall own property having a fair saleable value greater than the
amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable estimate of the
amount of all contingent liabilities) as they become absolute and mature;
and (ii) immediately after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the closing of any financing to be obtained by Parent or
any of its Affiliates in order to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Surviving Corporation shall not have, as of such date,
unreasonably small capital to carry on its business. Neither Parent nor Merger
Subsidiary is entering into the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors of Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.11 _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed guarantee of ZM Capital,
L.P. (the " _Guarantor_ ") in the form set forth on _Exhibit D_ hereto (the "
_Guarantee_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, the Guarantee is valid and
in full force and effect, and no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default on the part of
the Guarantor under the Guarantee.

Section 5.12 _Agreements with Company Stockholders, Directors or Management_.
Parent has entered into employment term sheets dated as of the date hereof
with those other parties appearing on the signature pages thereto
(collectively, the " _Employment Term Sheets_ "). Parent has delivered true
and complete copies of the Employment Term Sheets to the Company. As of the
date hereof, except for the Employment Term Sheets and the Voting Agreement,
neither Parent, Merger Subsidiary nor any of their respective Affiliates is a
party to any contract or agreement with any member of the Companys
management, directors or stockholders that relate in any way to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.13 _Access to Information; Disclaimer_. Each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has had an opportunity to
discuss the business and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the
management of the Company, (b) has had reasonable access to (i) the books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) the electronic dataroom

Intervening Event and/or (ii) to a Superior Proposal, in each case, if the

four (4) Business Day period following the Companys delivery of written
notice of the Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Subsidiary
in good faith (to the extent that Parent and Merger Subsidiary desire to
negotiate) to make such modification or adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so the Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal and (z) following the end of such four (4) Business Day
period, the Companys Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof
shall have determined in good faith, taking into account any changes to the
terms of this

 



 

45  Agreement proposed in writing by the Parent to the Company in response to
the notice of the Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal
giving rise to such notice of the Superior Proposal continues to constitute a

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 

Parent agrees that:

 

Section 7.01 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote any shares of Company
Common Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of
adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting, and shall take
all action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement.

Section 7.02 _Director and Officer Liability_. Without limiting
any additional rights that any Person may have under any agreement or Company
Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving
Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:

 

(a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, and provide
advancement of expenses ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay all such advances to
the extent that it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Person (as defined below) is not entitled to be indemnified
hereunder) to, the current and former officers and directors of the Company
(each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") in respect of acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware
Law or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Companys certificate
of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof or indemnification
agreements with directors of the Company in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such indemnification shall be subject to any
limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.



 

47 (b) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights for advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or
other agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
of this Agreement shall be assumed by and remain obligations of the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the Effective Time and
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any proceeding is pending
or asserted or any claim made during such period, until the final disposition
of such proceeding or claim. Further, the articles of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former
or present directors and officers than are presently set forth in the
Companys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such individuals.

 

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as of the
Effective Time, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable
extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys
existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D andO
Insurance_"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies
with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement,
misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter
claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, those individuals listed on
_Exhibit E_ hereto) by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that
existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall give the Company a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the selection of such tail policy and Parent
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the
Company with respect thereto. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least
six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place
as of the date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six (6)-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable
than as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, in
each case, with such modifications as may be necessary to include coverage
with respect to any matter claimed against each individual listed on _Exhibit
E_ hereto, in his or her capacity as a former director of the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the amount per annum



 

48  the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount has been made
available to Parent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for
a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 7.02_. In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this _Section
7.02_. The rights of this _Section 7.02_ are intended to be for the benefit
of the Third Parties referenced in this _Section 7.02_ and their respective
heirs and legal representatives.

 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this  _Section 7.02_ is not
prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.
These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to
benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, and shall not
be terminated or modified in a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Person to whom this _Section 7.02_ applies without the consent of such
affected Indemnified Party.

 

(f) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 7.02_.

Section 7.03 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent will give each employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who continues
employment with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ ," and collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ")
full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for
purposes of (a) eligibility and vesting under any Parent Employee Plan (as
defined below), (b) determination of benefit levels under any Parent Employee
Plan or policy relating to vacation or severance and (c) determination of
"retiree" status under any Parent Employee Plan, in each case for which the
Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employee
is offered participation, but except where such credit would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent shall waive, or cause to be
waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the
same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of
the Company and recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket
limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket
expenses paid by

 



 

49  Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Parent Employee Plan_ "
means any "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, each
material severance plan, arrangement or policy and each other plan or
arrangement providing for bonuses, profit-sharing or other material forms of
incentive compensation, vacation benefits, defined contribution retirement
benefits, health or medical benefits, employee assistance program, disability
or sick leave benefits and supplemental unemployment benefits.

 

(b) During the one (1) year period following the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
provide to all Continuing Employees, to the extent they remain employed during
such one (1) year period, compensation and benefits (other than equity-based
compensation) that are in the aggregate substantially comparable to the
compensation and benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Continuing Employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) Nothing in this _Section 7.03_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment of,
or undertaking to amend, any benefit plan, (ii) prohibit Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, from amending any employee
benefit plan, (iii) obligate Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Affiliates to retain the employment of any particular
employee or (iv) confer any rights or benefits on any person other than the
parties to this Agreement.

 

Section 7.04 _Equity Financing Commitment_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge that they have committed to
provide, subject to the Equity Financing Commitment, the Equity Financing,
including (i) maintaining in effect the Equity Financing Commitment, (ii)
ensuring the accuracy of all representations and warranties of Parent or
Merger Subsidiary set forth in the Equity Financing Commitment, (iii)
complying with all covenants and agreements of Parent or Merger Subsidiary set
forth in the Equity Financing Commitment, (iv) satisfying on a timely basis
all conditions applicable to Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in
the Equity Financing Commitment that are within their control, (v) upon
satisfaction of such conditions and other conditions set forth in _Section
9.01_ and _Section 9.02_ (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions), consummating the financing contemplated by the Equity
Financing Commitment at or prior to the Closing (and in any event prior to the
Outside Date) and (vi) fully enforcing the obligations of the Equity
Providers and their investment affiliates (and the rights of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary) under the Equity Financing Commitment.

 

(b) Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall amend, alter, or waive, or
agree to amend, alter or waive (in any case whether by action or inaction),
any term of the Equity Financing Commitment without the prior written consent
of the Company. Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees to notify the
Company promptly if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) the
Equity Financing Commitment expires or is terminated for any reason (or if
any person attempts or purports to terminate the Equity Financing Commitment,
whether or not such attempted or purported termination is valid), (ii) the
Equity Providers refuse to provide or express an intent in writing to refuse
to provide the full Equity Financing on the terms set forth in

 



 

50  the Equity Financing Commitment or (iii) for any reason, Parent or Merger
Subsidiary no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Equity Financing on the terms set forth in the Equity
Financing Commitment.

(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary each acknowledge and agree that the
obtaining of the Equity Financing is not a condition to the Closing.

other party to review in advance any communication planned to be 



 

51  given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or
conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other
applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party or its
Representatives the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings
and conferences. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Parent may, as
each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this  _Section 8.02(a)_ as
"Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel regarding
antitrust Applicable Law of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or consultants of the
recipient or any of its affiliates unless express permission is obtained in

waiting period provided for in the HSR Act.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in _Section 8.02(a)_ and  _Section 8.02(b)_, if any suit is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of the
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any antitrust Applicable
Laws or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement, and Parent, Sub
and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation of the Schedule 13E-3. The
Company shall use



 

52  reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to
the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable following the filing

on, or that it has no additional comments on, the Proxy Statement. Neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates, if applicable, shall correspond or
otherwise communicate with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement in any such case without providing Parent and Merger Subsidiary a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon or participate therein,
as the case may be and shall include in such Proxy Statement comments
reasonably proposed by Parent or Merger Subsidiary. Unless this Agreement is
earlier terminated pursuant to _Article 10_ , the Company shall (i) advise
Parent and Merger Subsidiary promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any
receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for an amendment or revisions to
the Proxy Statement, any receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on the

Parent or Merger Subsidiary, or any of their respective directors, officers
or Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger
Subsidiary which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 so that the Proxy Statement, the
Schedule 13E-3, or any other filing required under Applicable Law, as

state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy

efforts to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Debt Financing Commitment (or terms not materially less favorable, in the

Merger Subsidiary may replace or amend the Debt Financing Commitment Letters
to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar
entities which had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date

contemplated hereby or the likelihood of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby), including by using reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment and negotiate a definitive
agreement (collectively, the " _Debt Financing Agreement_ ") with respect to
the Debt Financing Commitment on the terms and conditions set forth in the

three (3) Business Days, if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) a Debt
Financing Commitment expires or is terminated for any reason (or if any person
attempts or purports to terminate a Debt Financing Commitment, whether or not
such attempted or purported termination is valid), (ii) a lender refuses to
provide all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by a Debt
Financing Commitment on the terms set forth therein, or (iii) for any reason
Parent or Merger Subsidiary no longer believes in good faith that it will be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on substantially the
terms described in the Debt Financing Commitments. Neither Parent nor Merger
Subsidiary shall, nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates to, without the
prior written consent of the Company, take any action or enter into any
transaction, including any merger, acquisition, joint venture,
disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that could
reasonably be expected to impair, delay or prevent consummation of all or any
portion of the Debt Financing. Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall
amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, a Debt Financing Commitment in
any manner that would materially impair, delay or prevent the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Company.

 

(c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in a Debt Financing Commitment or Debt
Financing Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to promptly obtain such Debt Financing from
alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of
the Financing that is available, to pay in cash all amounts required to be
paid by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and Merger Subsidiary in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger
Consideration, the Option Consideration, the Restricted Stock Consideration
and all payments, fees and expenses related to or arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Alternative Debt Financing_ ")
and to obtain a new financing commitment letter (the " _Alternative Debt
Financing Commitment_ ") and a new definitive agreement with respect thereto
(the " _Alternative Debt Financing Agreement_ ") that provides for financing
on terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and
Merger Subsidiary taken as a whole and in an amount that is sufficient, when
added to the portion of the Financing that is available together with any cash
or cash equivalents held by the Company as of the Effective Time, to pay in
cash all amounts required to be paid by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
Merger Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, the Option Consideration, the
Restricted Stock Consideration and all payments, fees and expenses related to
or arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In such
event, the term "Debt Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
include any Alternative Debt Financing, the term "Debt Financing Commitment"
as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any Alternative Debt
Financing Commitment, and the term "Debt Financing Agreement" as used in this
Agreement shall be deemed to include any Alternative Debt Financing Agreement.



 

56 (d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
respective officers, employees and other Representatives, including legal and
accounting advisors to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent
in connection with the Debt Financing, including (i) assisting with the
preparation for, and participating in, customary meetings, presentations and
due diligence sessions, (ii) assisting with the preparation of bank
information memoranda (including the delivery of one or more customary
representation letters), private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents required in connection with the Financing, (iii) executing and
delivering any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing
documents, or other certificates, opinions or documents as may be reasonably
requested by Parent (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to solvency matters)
and consents of accountants for use of their reports in any materials
relating to the Debt Financing) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the
pledging of collateral, (iv) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
accountants comfort letters, legal opinions as reasonably requested by
Parent, (v) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit the
prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Companys
inventory, properties, current assets, cash management and accounting
systems, policies and procedures relating thereto, and to assist the
prospective lenders with field audits and collateral and asset examinations,
in each case for the purpose of establishing collateral eligibility
and values and (B) establish bank and other accounts and blocked account
agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing and (vi)
taking all corporate actions necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt
Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the
Surviving Corporation, including the entering into of one or more credit
agreements or other instruments on terms satisfactory to Parent in connection
with the Debt Financing immediately prior to, and conditioned upon the
occurrence of, the Effective Time to the extent the direct borrowing or debt
incurrence by the Company is contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (A) nothing herein shall require such
cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the ongoing
business or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (B) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment
or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the
financings contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment prior to the
Effective Time. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by
the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. All non-
public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company obtained by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives
pursuant to this _Section 8.09(d)_ shall be kept confidential in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall, on a
joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
(other than to the extent that such losses arise from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives) and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than information provided by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries).

(e) The Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate executed by the chief
financial officer of the Company setting forth Consolidated EBITDA (as defined
in _Section 8.09(e)_ of the

 



 

57  Company Disclosure Schedule) for the month ended June 30, 2010 and each
month thereafter, together with supporting calculations in reasonable detail,
by twenty (20) days following the end of each such month.

Company Acquisition Proposal or a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have
been consummated (regardless of whether such Company Acquisition Proposal is
made before or after termination of this Agreement or is the same Company

agrees to pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee, _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the amount of the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to this
_Section 11.04(b)(ii)_ shall be reduced by any amount paid by the Company to
Parent in respect of the Company Acquisition Proposal Expense Reimbursement
pursuant to this _Section 11.04(b)(ii)_;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that no Company Acquisition Proposal Expense
Reimbursement or Company Termination Fee shall be payable by the Company
pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) above if at the time of such termination Parent
or Merger Subsidiary is in material breach of its or their obligations under
this Agreement.

 



 

64 (iii) Parent agrees to pay a fee (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") to the
Company in the amount of $5,800,000 if:

in  _Section 9.01_ and _Section 9.02_ (other than (x) the condition set
forth in _Section 9.02(e)_ and (y) those other conditions that, by their
nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but, in the case of
clause (y), which conditions would be satisfied if the Closing Date were the
date of such termination) have been satisfied or waived on or prior to the
date of such termination; and (ii) all conditions have been satisfied under
the Debt Financing and full proceeds of the Debt Financing (subject to the
maximum leverage ratio set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment) would be
available to be drawn down by Parent if Parent funded the Equity Commitment at

Parent pursuant to this clause (iii) if at the time of such termination the
Company is in material breach of its or their obligations under this
Agreement.

(c)  _Payment_.

(i) The payment of the Company Acquisition Proposal Expense Reimbursement
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds within ten (10)

(ii) The payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds by the Company within two (2) Business Days

the payment of the Company Termination Fee in the case of _Section
11.04(b)(ii)_, but shall be due simultaneously with such termination if
pursuant to _Section 11.04(b)(i)(B)_. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment
to be made by the Company under  _Section 11.04(b)_ shall be payable only
once to the Parents designees with respect to _Section 11.04(b)_ and not in
duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more
provisions hereof or on more occasion pursuant to the same subsection of this
_Section 11.04_.

(iii) The payment of the Parent Termination Fee shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds by Parent to the Company within two
(2) Business Days following the termination of this Agreement in the case of a
termination by the Company and concurrently with such termination in the case
of a termination by Parent.

(d) _Other Costs and Expenses_. Each party hereto acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 11.04_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the other party would not have entered into this 



 

65  Agreement. Accordingly, if a party fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to this _Section 11.04_ when due, such party shall also pay any
costs and expenses incurred by the other party in connection with a legal
action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment against such party
for such amount, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost
or expense at the publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the
date such fee, cost or expense was required to be paid to (but excluding) the
payment date.

(e)  _Exclusive Remedy_. The parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this _Section 11.04_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement. Except as provided in _Section
11.04(b)_ and _Section 11.04(d)_, respectively, the payments required to be
made by the Company or Parent, as applicable, pursuant to _Section 11.04(b)_
shall not be in lieu of liability for damages incurred in the event of a
breach of this agreement, but otherwise shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy of Company or Parent, as applicable, in connection with any
termination of this Agreement.

 

(f) _No-Vote Expense Reimbursement_. In recognition of the efforts, expenses
and other opportunities foregone by Parent while structuring and pursuing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay the
Parent up to $2,500,000 as reimbursement (the " _No-Vote Expense
Reimbursement_ ") for expenses actually incurred by Parent or its Affiliates
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, but
not limited to, reasonable fees and expenses of Parents counsel, accountants,
financial advisors and financing sources), in the event of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(iii)_, to which the
provisions of _Section 11.04(b)(ii)_ do not apply. The expenses payable
pursuant to this _Section 11.04(f)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within ten (10) Business Days following such
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(iii)_. The
payment of the No-Vote Expense Reimbursement pursuant to this _Section
11.04(f)_ shall not relieve the Company of any obligation to pay the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 11.04(b)_, _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company Termination Fee shall be reduced by any amount paid by the Company
to Parents designees pursuant to this _Section 11.04(f)_.

Section 11.05 _Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References_. The parties
hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or any Company SEC Document filed after January 31, 2010
and prior to the date hereof shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in
the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any other representations
and warranties of the Company that is contained in this Agreement if the
relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes
of) such representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent to a
reasonable person who has read that reference and such representations and
warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader
regarding the matter(s) so disclosed. The inclusion of any information in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or in any Company SEC Document filed after
January 31, 2009, as applicable, shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the
terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or would result in
a Material Adverse Effect or is outside the ordinary course of business.



 

66 Section 11.06 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

 

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Except as provided in _Section 7.02_ and _Section 11.13_ (relating
to the Companys actions on behalf of its stockholders), no provision of this
Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations
or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that such transfer or
assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations
hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto
or due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary. Any assignment in violation of the
foregoing shall be null and void.

Section 11.07  _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 

Section 11.08 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or
against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware
Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each
of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action
or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each party agrees that service of process on such party as
provided in _Section 11.01_ shall be deemed effective service of process on
such party.

Section 11.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 

Section 11.10 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or

  

 

67  obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by
facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in PDF form, or by any other
electronic means designed to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, will be deemed to have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signatures. 

Section 11.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Voting Agreement constitute the entire agreement between
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. 

Section 11.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible. 

Section 11.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties recognize and agree that if
for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed by
the Company in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached,
immediate and irreparable harm or injury would be caused for which money
damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees that,
in addition to other remedies, prior to any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.01_, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be entitled
to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy
at law or equity. In the event that any action shall be brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of the Agreement, the Company shall not allege, and
hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at Law. The
parties further acknowledge that the Company shall not be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and that the Companys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
any such breach shall be the remedy available to the Company set forth in
_Section 11.04_.
