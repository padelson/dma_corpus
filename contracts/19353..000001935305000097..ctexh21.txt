Seller) without the prior written consent of Buyer; provided, however, that
the foregoing restriction shall not apply to (i) any information which is or
becomes publicly known through no fault of any Seller or which is lawfully
obtained from a third party that is not bound by a contractual, legal or
other confidentiality obligation to the Company, any Subsidiary, Buyer, or
Guarantor, (ii) any information which such Seller is duly authorized to
disclose in connection with such Seller\'s employment with the Company post-
Closing, (iii) any disclosure required by applicable Law, any final order or
judgment of a Governmental Body, any rule or regulation of the Nasdaq Stock
Market ("Nasdaq") or another securities exchange applicable to such Seller or
in connection with the enforcement of such Seller\'s rights under any Seller
Transaction Document or Company Transaction Document, (iv) any disclosures
required or requested by the FTC or DOJ in connection with its review of the
transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or (v) any disclosures by
a Principal Stockholder to its Representatives or other equityholders;
provided that, in any such event, a Principal Stockholder shall be
responsible for any breach of the terms hereof by any of its Representatives
or other equityholder to whom or to which such confidential or proprietary
information was disclosed by such Principal Stockholder; and provided further
that, disclosure by any Principal Stockholder to any of its Representatives
or other equityholders of the general monetary and structural terms of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the disclosure generally that the
transactions contemplated hereby have been consummated shall not constitute a
breach of this Section 6.8.   6.9 Waivers. The Sellers identified in Section
6.9 of the Disclosure Schedule hereby irrevocably waive, effective as of the
Closing, the rights set forth in Section 6.9 to the Disclosure Schedule.  
6.10 Pre-Closing Deliverables. At least three Business Days before
the Closing Date, the Company shall cause to be prepared and delivered to
Buyer (a) the Payoff Letters, (b) a final invoice and wire transfer
instructions from each payee of any portion of the Transaction Expenses, and
(c) a final invoice of all expenses constituting Reimbursement Expenses. Each
of the Payoff Letters provided pursuant to this Section 6.10 shall
separately    43   specify all amounts attributable to principal,
accrued interest and Termination Fees, if any, and shall include an
undertaking by such party (which shall, subject to receipt of the amounts set
forth in such letter, be unconditional) to discharge on the Closing Date any
liens, security interests, mortgages, restrictions and encumbrances securing
such indebtedness. Each of the Payoff Letters shall also include an
undertaking to return marked "Cancelled" any notes or other instruments
evidencing such indebtedness (or, in the alternative, to provide affidavits
of loss reasonably satisfactory to Buyer).   6.11 Supplement to Disclosure
Schedule. If pursuant to Section 6.1(f) the Company or the Sellers\'
Representative advise Buyer at any time after the date hereof and prior to
the date that is five days prior to the Closing Date, that by reason of a
condition or event that arises after the date hereof, any representation or
warranty in this Agreement has been rendered untrue or inaccurate, or would
be rendered inaccurate as of the Closing, the Company or the Sellers\'
Representative, as applicable, shall supplement the affected Section of the
Disclosure Schedule to reflect such condition or event. If the delivery of
such supplemented or amended Section of the Disclosure Schedule pursuant to
this Section 6.11 is acknowledged by the Company or the
Sellers\' Representative, as applicable, to constitute a failure to satisfy
the condition to Buyer\'s obligations to consummate the Closing set forth in
Section 12.1(b), unless such failure is reasonably curable by the Company or
the Sellers and prior to Closing is actually cured, and if Buyer determines
to waive the condition set forth in Section 12.1(b) hereof after the delivery
of such supplement or amended Section of the Disclosure Schedule, then the
Company\'s or the Sellers\', as applicable, representations or warranties,
shall be deemed modified, amended and supplemented by such amended or
supplemented Schedule, and following such waiver shall not, with respect to
such matters, be the basis of any liability or indemnification claim against
the Company, the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, as
applicable, and shall not be the basis for a termination of this Agreement by
Buyer under Section 12.1 or Section 13 hereof.   6.12 Preparation of
Financial Statements. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the
Company and the Sellers shall cooperate, and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives,
including Deloitte and Touche LLP and its subsidiaries (collectively, "DandT;"),
to cooperate, with Buyer and Guarantor in connection with the preparation of
certain financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries as requested
by Buyer. All out-of-pocket fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the
Company, the Sellers and the Company\'s Representatives pursuant to this
Section 6.12 shall be paid or promptly reimbursed by Buyer to the Sellers
prior to or at the Closing. Neither any Seller nor the Company shall be
obligated pursuant to this Section 6.12 to disrupt in any significant manner
its operations or conduct of business in providing such cooperation, and any
such cooperation shall be provided during customary business hours and upon
reasonable notice. None of any Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Representatives shall be obligated to assist Buyer or Guarantor pursuant to
this Section 6.12 to the extent such assistance would interfere in the
Sellers\' and the Company\'s ability to satisfy their respective obligations
to use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, as required pursuant to Section 9.1, or could otherwise
be reasonably expected to result in the Sellers or the Company not being able
to satisfy a condition to the Closing set forth in Section 12.1.    
44    SECTION 7. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS   7.1
Records. On the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver or cause to be delivered
to Buyer all material agreements, documents, books, records and
files relating to the business and operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, "Records"), if any, in the possession of Sellers
to the extent not then in the possession of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
subject to the following exceptions:   (a) Buyer recognizes that certain
Records may contain incidental information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries or may relate primarily to a Seller or an Affiliate of such
Seller (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries) and that Sellers may
retain such Records and shall provide copies of the relevant portions thereof
to Buyer; and   (b) Sellers may retain (i) all Records prepared by Sellers
or their Representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including analyses relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries and (ii) copies of all materials received by any Related
Controlling Party that is a director of the Company as of the date hereof in
connection with such Person\'s acting in such capacity.   7.2 Non-
Solicitation.   (a) From and after the date hereof and until the 12 month
anniversary of the Closing, neither (i) any JPM General Partner nor (ii) any
Principal Stockholder or (iii) any Affiliate of any JPM General Partner or
Principal Stockholder in which any JPM General Partner or one or more
Principal Stockholders, individually or together with any other JPM General
Partner, Principal Stockholder or any of their Affiliates, own equity
interests (including securities convertible into or exchangeable for such
equity interests) in an amount sufficient to permit such Persons collectively
to elect a majority of the board of directors (or comparable governing body)
of such Affiliate (a "Controlled Portfolio Company") shall, without the prior
written approval of Buyer, directly or indirectly (including through
their Representatives), solicit for employment or shall hire (as an
employee, consultant or otherwise) (i) any individual listed in Section 8.4
of the Disclosure Schedule or (ii) any group of employees of the Company or
any Subsidiary that would constitute a significant portion of the workforce
of such entity; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction on
solicitation shall not prohibit a general solicitation (such as an
advertisement) not specifically directed to employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.   (b) Each Principal Stockholder and Buyer agree that, in the
event of a breach of the non-solicitation covenant contained in this
Agreement, the damage or imminent damage to the value and the goodwill of the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall be inestimable and that therefore any
remedy at Law or in damages would be inadequate. Accordingly, the parties
agree that following prior written notice to the Principal Stockholders,
Buyer shall (without the necessity of posting any bond or other security), in
addition to Damages incurred by reason of any such breach, be entitled to
injunctive relief, including specific performance, with respect to any such
breach in any court of competent jurisdiction against such Principal
Stockholders. Each Principal Stockholder shall be liable    45   for
any breach of this Section 7.2 by any Controlled Portfolio Company.
The duration of the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.2 shall be
extended by a period of time equal to the number of days, if any, during
which a Principal Stockholder or Controlled Portfolio Company is in violation
of this covenant.   7.3 Waivers. Each Principal Stockholder hereby
irrevocably waives all rights that it may have under the agreements set forth
in Section 7.3 of the Disclosure Schedule; provided, however, that the
Principal Stockholders do not waive, and this provision shall not be
construed as the Principal Stockholders waiving, any rights that any such
Principal Stockholder may have under the Management Agreement to be
reimbursed for any expenses actually incurred by them (such amount not to
exceed $20,000) (the "Reimbursement Expenses") to the extent identified to
Buyer and paid at Closing pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(iii)(B).   7.4 Release.
Following the Closing, Sellers\' Representative shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts, at its expense (except as provided herein), to obtain
prior to the 15 month anniversary of the Closing, a full and
complete release, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer (the
"T-I Release"), of all liabilities and obligations of the Company, of any
nature whatsoever, pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement dated as
of May 31, 1997 between Temple-Inland Mortgage Corporation (together with
its Affiliates, "Temple Inland"), KMC Management Company, Marathon Fund
Limited Partnership II, Chase Manhattan Capital, L.P. and Chase Venture
Capital Associates, L.P. (the "Temple Inland Agreement"). Buyer and the
Company shall cooperate, as reasonably requested by the Sellers\'
Representative, in obtaining the T-I Release, including in the manner
contemplated by Section 14.5(e). Buyer and the Company hereby grant the
Sellers\' Representative with full power of attorney to act on behalf of the
Company in connection with obtaining the T-I Release. Upon delivery to Buyer
of the T-I Release, Buyer shall (i) pay to the Sellers\' Representative
$600,000 by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account
specified by the Sellers\' Representative in writing and (ii) deliver to the
Sellers\' Representative or its nominee all of the shares of GHR Investment
Corp. currently owned by it (the "GHR Investment Stock"), together with
appropriate stock powers or other instruments of transfer (without
any representations or warranties, other than that following the Closing the
Company has not assigned or transferred any right therein). During the period
from Closing until the date on which the GHR Investment Stock has been
duly transferred to the Sellers\' Representative in accordance with this
Section 7.4, (a) none of the Company, Buyer or Guarantor shall, without the
prior written consent of the Sellers\' Representative, (i) sell, transfer,
assign or otherwise dispose of or alienate any of the GHR Investment Stock
or, to the extent the Company or Guarantor has the power to control the
actions of GHR Investment Corp. by virtue of its ownership of the GHR
Investment Stock, permit GHR Investment Corp. to sell, transfer, assign or
otherwise dispose of or alienate any of the shares of stock of GHR Systems,
Inc. held by GHR Investment Corp. (the "GHR Systems Stock"), (ii) create any
Encumbrance on any of the GHR Investment Stock or GHR Systems Stock (except
for any Encumbrance that exists as of the date of this Agreement), (b) Buyer
shall promptly provide to the Sellers\' Representative written notice of any
matter in which the Company may be entitled to vote the GHR Investment Stock
or direct the vote of the GHR Systems Stock and shall direct the Company to
vote the GHR Investment Stock or direct the vote of the GHR   
46   Systems Stock with respect to such matter as directed by the
Sellers\' Representative to Buyer in writing, and (c) Buyer and the Company
shall set aside (i) any dividends or other distributions (whether cash or
otherwise) derived from the Company\'s ownership of the GHR Investment Stock,
including any dividends or other distributions (whether cash or otherwise) on
the GHR Systems Stock to which the Company may be entitled by virtue of its
ownership of the GHR Investment Stock, (ii) any amounts received by the
Company upon the sale, disposition, conversion or exchange of the GHR
Investment Stock or GHR Systems Stock, which amounts shall be delivered to
the Sellers\' Representative upon transfer of the GHR Investment Stock in
accordance with this Section 7.4, in each case, net of any taxes payable by
the Company or Buyer in connection with such transactions.   SECTION 8.
COVENANTS OF BUYER AND GUARANTOR   8.1 Confidential Information.   (a)
Each of Guarantor and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that from the date hereof
until Closing, neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use for
any purpose, other than in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, or shall disclose, any confidential or proprietary information of the
Company or any Subsidiary to any Person (other than its Representatives)
without the prior written consent of the Sellers\' Representative; provided,
however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to (i) any
information which is or becomes publicly known through no fault of Buyer or
Guarantor or which is lawfully obtained from a third party that is not bound
by a contractual, legal or other confidentiality obligation to the Company,
(ii) any disclosure required by applicable Law, any final order or judgment
of a Governmental Body, any rule or regulation of Nasdaq or another

Guarantor\'s rights under any Buyer Transaction Document, or (iii) any
disclosures required or requested by the FTC or DOJ in connection with its
review of the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act. Buyer and
Guarantor shall use reasonable commercial methods to ensure

breach of the terms hereof by any of their Representatives.   (b) Each of
Buyer and Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that on and after the date
hereof, until the 18 month anniversary of the Closing, neither it nor any of
its Affiliates shall, other than in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, use for any purpose or disclose to any
Person (other than its Representatives) any confidential information of or
relating to any Seller without the prior written consent of such Seller;
provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply (i) to any
information which is or becomes publicly known through no fault of Buyer or
Guarantor or which is lawfully obtained from a third party that is not bound
by a contractual, legal or confidentiality obligation to such Seller, (ii) to
any disclosure required by Law, any final order or judgment of a Governmental

FTC or DOJ in connection with its review of the transactions contemplated
hereby under the HSR Act or (iv) to any     47   information that is

Subsidiaries in connection with the employment of such Seller after Closing,
with respect to confidential information of any Seller that remains
an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing, for
so long as such Seller remains an employee.   8.2 Governmental
Authorizations. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
each of Buyer and Guarantor shall use its best efforts to (i) obtain (and
cooperate with the other parties hereto in obtaining) all Governmental
Authorizations necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and (ii) make (and
cooperate with the other parties hereto in making) all filings required to be
made by Buyer pursuant to applicable Laws in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. This Section 8.2
shall not apply to filings and Governmental Authorizations to be made under
the HSR Act, which are addressed solely in Section 9.4, or Consents that are
not Governmental Authorizations, which are addressed solely in Section
9.2.   8.3 Notice of Breach; Failure to Satisfy Closing Condition. From the
date hereof until the Closing, Buyer and Guarantor shall promptly advise the
Sellers\' Representative and the Company upon obtaining Knowledge of (a) any
threat or commencement of any dispute, claim, action, suit, proceeding,
arbitration or investigation by, against or affecting Buyer, Guarantor or any
of their respective Affiliates or any of their properties, operations, assets
or prospects, which would have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect (b) the
existence of any fact or condition that would constitute a breach of any of
Buyer\'s or Guarantor\'s representations or warranties contained herein, (c)
the occurrence of any breach of any covenant of Buyer or Guarantor in this
Agreement or (d) the occurrence of any event that would make the satisfaction
of the conditions in Section 12.2 impossible or unlikely.   8.4 Non-
Solicitation.   (a) Prior to Closing, none of Buyer, Guarantor or any of
their respective Affiliates shall, without the prior written approval of the
Sellers\' Representative, directly or indirectly (including through
their Representatives), hire (as an employee, consultant or otherwise) (i)
any individual set forth on Section 8.4 of the Disclosure Schedule or (ii)
any group of employees of the Company or any Subsidiary that would constitute
a significant portion of the workforce of such entity.   (b) If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 13, each of Buyer and Guarantor
agree that, prior to the 12 month anniversary of the date of
such termination, neither Buyer nor Guarantor nor any of their respective
Affiliates, without the prior written approval of the Sellers\'
Representative, directly or indirectly (including through their
Representatives), shall solicit for employment or shall hire (as an employee,
consultant or otherwise) (i) any individual set forth on Section 8.4 of the
Disclosure Schedule or (ii) any group of employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary that would constitute a significant portion of the workforce of
such entity; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction on
solicitation shall not prohibit a general solicitation (such as an
advertisement) not specifically directed to employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.     48    (c) Each of Buyer and Guarantor agree that in
the event of a breach of Sections 8.4(a) or (b), the damage or imminent
damage to the value and the goodwill of the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall be inestimable and that therefore any remedy at Law or in damages would
be inadequate. Accordingly, the parties agree that following prior written
notice to Buyer, the Sellers shall (without the necessity of posting any bond
or other security), in addition to Damages incurred by reason of any such
breach, be entitled to injunctive relief, including specific performance,
with respect to any such breach in any court of competent jurisdiction
against Buyer, Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates. Each of Buyer
and Guarantor shall be liable for any breach of this Section 8.4 by its
respective Affiliates. The duration of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 8.4 shall be extended by a period of time equal to the number of

covenant.   8.5 Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification.   (a) For a
period of five years commencing on the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall maintain officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance covering the Persons who, immediately prior to the Closing Date,
were covered by the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' officers\' and
directors\' liability insurance policies with respect to actions and
omissions occurring prior to and on the Closing Date, on terms which in the
aggregate are no less favorable to such Persons than the terms of such
current insurance in effect for the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
date hereof.   (b) For a period of five years after the Closing, Buyer and
Guarantor shall cause the Company to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
each of the current officers of the Company and any Subsidiary and each of
the current directors of the Company and any Subsidiary that are not
Affiliates of any Principal Stockholder against all liabilities, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees), and amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement in connection with any threatened, pending or contemplated action
or proceeding to which any such officer or director was or is a party or
witness, or is threatened to be made a party or a witness, by reason of the
fact that, prior to the Closing Date, such person was a director or officer
of the Company or a Subsidiary. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no person shall be entitled to indemnification under this Section
8.5(b): (i) if the claim, obligation, or liability with respect to which
indemnity is sought shall have been determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have arisen out of or been based upon conduct by such person
that is fraudulent, dishonest, or constitutes gross negligence or breach of
such person\'s fiduciary obligations to the Company; (ii) in respect of any
action or proceeding brought or commenced by such person, other than
mandatory counterclaims and affirmative defenses; (iii) in respect of any
action brought to enforce rights or obligations under this Agreement or
any Transaction Document; or (iv) if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine, by a final judgment or decree, that such indemnity is
prohibited under applicable Law.    SECTION 9. ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF
BUYER, THE COMPANY AND SELLERS   49     9.1 Further Assurances. Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, Buyer and Guarantor shall each use its best efforts, and each
other party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary or desirable under applicable Laws to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents (including Buyer and Guarantor
using their respective best efforts and each other party hereto using his,
her or its commercially reasonable efforts) to cause the Closing to occur on
or prior to June 15, 2005) and shall, from time to time and without further
consideration, either before or after the Closing, execute such further
instruments and take such other actions as any other party hereto
shall reasonably request in order to fulfill its obligations under any of
the Transaction Documents, to effectuate the purposes of the Transaction
Documents and to provide for the orderly and efficient transition of the
ownership of the Company to Buyer. For purposes of this Section 9.1, the term
"commercially reasonable efforts" shall not include any obligation of any
party to expend money (other than filing fees, amounts contemplated by the
Transaction Documents and other nominal amounts), commence or participate in
any material claim, action, proceeding or litigation or grant any material
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any Person.   9.2 Certain Filings
and Consents. Each party to this Agreement shall cooperate with one another
(i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with,
any Governmental Body is required, or whether any Consents are required to be
obtained from parties to any material contracts, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents,
and (ii) subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, in taking such actions or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking timely to
obtain any such Consents. Until the Closing, the Sellers and the Company
shall, and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, upon the request of Buyer,
any such Consents; provided, however, that such cooperation shall not include
any requirement of the Company, any Subsidiary or any Seller at any time to
expend money (other than filing fees and other nominal amounts), commence
or participate in any material claim, action, proceeding or litigation or
offer or grant any material accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any
third Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Buyer acknowledges that
certain Consents with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents may be required from parties to
certain agreements or Governmental Authorizations identified on the
Disclosure Schedule hereto and that such Consents have not been and/or will
not be obtained prior to the Closing. Buyer agrees that no Seller or the
Company shall have any liability whatsoever to Buyer or Guarantor arising out
of or relating to the failure of the Company to obtain any such Consents that
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents or because of the termination of any agreement or
Governmental Authorizations as a result of the failure to obtain a Consent
thereunder. Buyer and Guarantor further agree that no representation,
warranty or covenant of Sellers or the Company contained herein shall be
breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed not satisfied,
as a result of (i) the failure to obtain any Consent or Government
Authorization, (ii) any such termination or (iii) any claim, action or
proceeding commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain any such Consent or   
50   any such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
hereto agree that this Section 9.2 shall not relate to filings to be made and
Consents to be received under the HSR Act, which are addressed solely in
Section 9.4.   9.3 Public Announcements. Each party hereto agrees that no
public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall be issued by any
such party without the prior consent of the other parties hereto (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except (a) press
releases by Guarantor, the Principal Stockholders and the Company regarding
the execution of this Agreement, (b) an announcement to employees of the
Company and the Subsidiaries regarding the execution of this Agreement, (c) a
public release by Guarantor, the Principal Stockholders or the Company
regarding the Closing and (d) any other release that may be required by
applicable Laws or the rules or regulations of Nasdaq (including on Form 8-K
of the Securities and Exchange Commission), provided however, in the case of
each of (a)-(d) above, the party required to make the release or announcement
shall, to the extent practicable, allow the other parties reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. Any
communication by the Principal Stockholders solely to their respective
partners shall not be considered a "public release or announcement" for
purposes of this Section 9.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision of
this Agreement shall relieve Buyer or any of its Representatives or
Affiliates from any of their obligations under Section 8.1 or any Seller or
any of his, her or its Representatives or Affiliates (limited in the case of
the Principal Stockholders to the Controlled Portfolio Companies and JPM
General Partners) from any of their obligations under Section 6.8.   9.4
HSR Filings. The Principal Stockholders and Buyer shall promptly provide any
supplemental information required or requested by the United States Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the
"DOJ") in connection with the notification and report form filed with the FTC
and the DOJ by Buyer and the Principal Stockholders on May 12, 2005
pursuant to the HSR Act. Each of Buyer and the Sellers shall furnish to the
other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
party may request in connection with its preparation of any supplemental
information which is necessary or desirable under the HSR Act. The Sellers\'
Representative and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the FTC and the DOJ and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or
request. Each of the Principal Stockholders and Buyer shall request early
termination under the HSR Act within two Business Days after the public
announcement of the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Buyer shall use
its best efforts, and each of the Principal Stockholders shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain expiration or termination of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Buyer will use its best efforts, and the Principal Stockholders will use
their commercially reasonable efforts, to take, or cause to be taken, all
other actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other things which are, in
each case, necessary or desirable under all applicable Laws to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this Section 9.4, the term
"commercially reasonable efforts" shall not include any obligation of the
Company or any Subsidiary prior to the Closing, or any Seller at any time, to
expend money    51   (other than nominal amounts and filing fees), sell,
dispose or otherwise transfer any assets, commence or participate in any
claim, action, proceeding or litigation, or grant any material accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any Person.   9.5 Release. (a) Except as
provided herein, from and after the Closing, (i) the Company irrevocably
releases, and the Company will cause each Subsidiary to release, the
Sellers\' Representative and each Principal Stockholder, (ii) each Principal
Stockholder irrevocably releases the Company and each Subsidiary and (iii)
each Seller irrevocably releases each other Seller (other than with respect
to such rights and obligations as are set forth in the Contribution Agreement
signed on the date hereof by each of the Sellers, the General
Escrow Agreement, the Tax Escrow Agreement and the Temple Inland Escrow
Agreement), including, in each case, their respective officers, directors,
equityholders, partners, Affiliates, and Representatives (collectively, the
"Released Parties") from any and all actions, causes of action, suits, debts,
dues, sums of money, accounts, reckoning, bonds, bills, liabilities,
specialties, covenants, contracts, controversies, agreements, promises,
variances, trespasses, damages, judgments, extents, executions, claims and
demands (each, a "Released Claim"), and agree not to bring or threaten to
bring or otherwise join in any Released Claim against a Released Party,
relating to, arising out of or in connection with any facts or circumstances
relating to (x) the Sellers in relation to their investment in the Company,
or (y) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which existed on or prior to
the Closing Date. From and after the Closing, Sellers shall have no rights,
hereunder or otherwise, to indemnification or contribution from the Company
or any Subsidiary with respect to any matters occurring prior to Closing,
including any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of
the Company made in or pursuant to this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, or any breach or nonfulfillment of any pre-Closing
covenant or pre-Closing obligation of the Company contained in this Agreement
or any Transaction Document, and Sellers hereby irrevocably release the
Company and each Subsidiary from any liability for any such claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Section 9.5 shall in no way
alter, affect or amend (i) the rights or claims of any Seller against any
Person under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document (including
rights to indemnification pursuant to Section 14), (ii) the rights of the
Principal Stockholders to be reimbursed for the Reimbursement Expenses (to
the extent provided herein), the obligations of the parties hereto to comply

arrangement to which such Seller is subject or a party or in relation to any
Seller\'s status as an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, (iv) the
rights of any Controlled Portfolio Company under any agreement, contract or
understanding, whether entered into prior to the date hereof, on or after the
date hereof and prior to Closing in accordance with the terms hereof or after
the Closing.   (b) Each Seller hereby waives all rights to receive any
notice required to be delivered pursuant to the Stockholders\' Agreement, the
Crosstown Traders, Inc. 2002 Stock Option Plan or any other agreement to
which such Seller is a party in connection with the    52   execution
and delivery of any Transaction Document and the transactions contemplated by
any Transaction Document.   (c) Each Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees
that, effective upon the Closing, the Registration Rights Agreement, the
Stockholders\' Agreement, the Consulting Agreement, the Management Agreement
and each other agreement set forth in Section 9.5(c) to the Disclosure
Schedule to which such Seller is a party shall be terminated and be of no
further force and effect, and each such Seller further acknowledges and
agrees that such Seller is not entitled to any payment from the Company or
any other Person in connection with such termination. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the terms of this Section 9.5(c) shall not affect any other rights
of the Sellers to receive their respective portions of the Aggregate Cash
Proceeds, the Specified Employees Bonus Amount or the Accrued Dividend Amount
at Closing or any other rights of the Sellers pursuant to the terms of the
Transaction Documents.   (d) Each Seller that is selling Options to Buyer
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement hereby acknowledges and agrees that
the payment received by such Seller hereunder shall be deemed to be full
payment for the cancellation of any vested and unvested options awarded to
such Seller under the Crosstown Traders, Inc. 2002 Stock Option Plan, and
each such Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that such Seller is not, and
shall not be, entitled to any further payment or consideration with respect
to any vested and unvested options granted to such Seller pursuant to the
Crosstown Traders, Inc. 2002 Stock Option Plan except as expressly set forth
in this Agreement.   SECTION 10. TAX MATTERS   10.1 Tax Representations of
the Company. The Company hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as of the
date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date that, except as set forth
in Section 10.1 of the Disclosure Schedule attached hereto:   (a) All Tax
Returns, or extensions relating thereto, required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries have been timely and properly
filed, and all such Tax Returns are correct and complete.   (b) All
liabilities for Taxes of the Company and the Subsidiaries (including any Tax
liabilities relating to other consolidated group members under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6) with respect to taxable periods ending on or
before, and the portion of any interim period up to, the Closing Date have
been fully and timely paid (to the extent due and payable) or, in the case of
Taxes not yet due, fully provided for on the Balance Sheet or the Interim
Balance Sheet or, in the case of Taxes accruing after the date of
the Unaudited Financial Statements, on the books and records of the Company
in accordance with past practice. There are no Encumbrances relating to
Taxes, other than Permitted Encumbrances of the type set forth in clause (i)
of the definition thereof, existing or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened or pending with respect to any asset of the Company or any
Subsidiary.     53    (c) Except as described in Section 10.1(c) of the
Disclosure Schedule, no issues have been raised in writing with the Company
or any Subsidiary (or are currently pending) by the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") or any other taxing authority in connection with any of the Tax
Returns referred to in Section 10.1(a) (including any assertion by a taxing
authority that a required Tax Return was not filed), and no waivers of
statutes of limitations have been given with respect to any such Tax Returns
or with respect to any Taxes.   (d) Section 10.1(d) of the Disclosure
Schedule identifies all Tax Returns of or with respect to the Company and the
Subsidiaries that are currently under examination by the IRS or by other
taxing authorities. There are no unpaid deficiencies asserted or assessments
made by any taxing authority against the Company or any Subsidiary.   (e)
Section 10.1(e) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all elections made by the
Company or by the Subsidiaries for federal or state income or franchise
Tax purposes that are currently applicable. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary (i) has agreed to or is currently required to make any adjustment
under Section 481(a) of the Code by reason of a change in accounting method,
(ii) has made any transfer of any intangible property with respect to which
Code Section 367(d) or 482 will require the recognition of additional income
after the Closing Date or (iii) owns stock in a "passive foreign investment
company" within the meaning of Code Section 1296(a). The books and records of
the Company and the Subsidiaries are sufficient to prove the correctness of
all Tax Returns for open Tax years and to determine and to prove the adjusted
Tax basis for federal income Tax purposes of each asset of the Company and
the Subsidiaries.   (f) Except as set forth in Section 10.1(f) of the
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (i) is a party to
any agreement, with any Person other than the Company and the Subsidiaries,
providing for the allocation or sharing of Taxes, or (ii) has been included
in any "consolidated," "unitary" or "combined" Tax Return with any such
Person since October 30, 2002.   (g) The representations made by the Company
in this Section 10.1 are the only representations and warranties made in this
Agreement with respect to Taxes and Tax matters and are made only with
respect to Tax periods that end on or prior to the Closing Date and the pre-
Closing Date portion of any Tax period that includes the Closing Date and
ends after such date. The Sellers and the Company make no representations or
warranties regarding (i) any Tax positions taken on or after the Closing Date
and (ii) other than with respect to Section 10.1(h), whether the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability to make or possibly make
any payments, either alone or in conjunction with other payments that are
non-deductible under, or would otherwise constitute a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding state,
local or foreign income Tax law) or the availability, validity or value of
any deductions taken on or after the Closing Date, and shall not be
responsible under this Agreement or otherwise for any such matters, any
payments made in connection therewith or the consequences thereof.    
54    (h) No Principal Stockholder has agreed or entered into an
understanding with, or otherwise promised (in writing or otherwise), any
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries that such Principal Stockholder
will vote to approve (as described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.280G-1, Q/A-7)
any amount payable to such employee that would otherwise constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code).   10.2
Tax Covenants of Sellers and the Company.   (a) The Sellers shall not be
required to indemnify for breach of a representation set forth in Section
10.1 or Taxes referred to in Section 14.2(d) or (e) until the relevant amount
becomes due and payable to the relevant taxing authority or the relevant Tax
claim by a taxing authority is otherwise resolved. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sellers may agree to pay any Tax asserted to be owed as a
consequence of a breach of such a representation in advance of such date.  
(b) Neither Buyer, the Company nor any Subsidiary shall amend any Tax Return
filed on or before the Closing Date, or take a position on a Tax Return after
the Closing Date, that is incompatible, in either case, with a position on a
Tax Return filed on or before the Closing Date in the sense that the
position taken on such later filing would require an amendment to, or
otherwise imply the incorrectness of, such earlier filing. Neither Buyer, the
Company nor any Subsidiary shall amend any Tax Return filed on or before the
Closing Date without the written consent of the Sellers\' Representative,
except for the purpose of claiming a refund resulting from a carryback from a
period ending after the Closing Date.   (c) Refunds of Taxes of the Company
and the Subsidiaries with respect to taxable years ended on or before the
Closing Date, including as a refund of an amount paid under the last sentence
of Section 10.2(a), aside from any refunds resulting from carrybacks from
periods ending after the Closing Date, shall be for Sellers\' account and, if
received by Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiaries, shall be paid over to the
Sellers\' Representative within 10 Business Days of receipt thereof.   (d)
The Sellers shall provide to Buyer at Closing (i) a certification of non-
foreign status, in accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 1.1445-2(b)(2),
with respect to each Seller that is not a foreign person for United States
federal income tax purposes and (ii) a certification issued by the Company in
accordance with Treas. Reg. Section 1.1445-2(c), that stock in the Company is
not a United States real property interest.   SECTION 11. EMPLOYEE
BENEFITS   11.1 Comparability of Benefits. For the period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2005, Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Company or its Subsidiaries), to provide employee
benefits to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee
benefits such employees were receiving from the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date.     55    11.2 Welfare Plans. To
the extent that Buyer causes any of the medical, dental or health plans
sponsored or maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries to be replaced
before December 31, 2005, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, (i) to
waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to those
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date and
their eligible dependents, other than conditions, exclusions or waiting
periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and their
eligible dependents under any group health plan maintained for such employees
and their eligible dependents and that have not been satisfied as of the date
such plan is replaced, and (ii) if coverage under the Company or Subsidiary
welfare plan is ended on a date other than the last day of the plan year,
provide each such employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for
any deductibles and co-payments applied or made with respect to each
such employee or his or her eligible dependents under an Employee Benefit
Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under such Employee
Benefit Plan prior to the date such plan was replaced) in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any such plans in
which such individuals may be eligible to participate after the Closing Date;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits.   11.3 Severance. Until December 31,
2005, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries) to maintain a severance pay plan, practice, program or
arrangement for the benefit of those employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date that is no less favorable than the
program identified in Section 11.3 of the Disclosure Schedule.   11.4
Service Credit. Buyer shall give those employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date full credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under the Employee Benefit Plans maintained or
sponsored by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) in which such employees participate after the Closing for
services rendered by such employees to the Company or its Subsidiaries prior
to the Closing, except to the extent such credit would result in an
unintended duplication of benefits.   SECTION 12. CLOSING CONDITIONS  
12.1 Conditions to Obligation of Buyer. The obligation of Buyer to
purchase the Securities and to take the other actions required to be taken by
Buyer at Closing is subject to the satisfaction or waiver by Buyer at the

of the Sellers in Section 3.2 and Section 3.4, and the representations and

hereto may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in this Section 12
to be satisfied if such failure was caused by Buyer or Guarantor\'s failure
to act in good faith or to use its best efforts to cause the Closing to occur
or the Company or any Seller\'s failure to act in good faith or to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur, in each case
as required hereunder.   SECTION 13. TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT   13.1
Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned at any time before the
Closing:   (a) by Buyer or the Sellers\' Representative, if the Closing has
not occurred by June 30, 2005; provided, however, that (i) in the event
the Disclosure Schedule is updated pursuant to Section 6.11 at any time on or
after June 16, 2005 and prior to June 30, 2005, such date shall automatically
be extended to the date that is 15 days following the date on which such
update was delivered to Buyer and (ii) neither Buyer nor Sellers\'
Representative may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause if the
Closing shall not have been consummated by June 30, 2005 (or such later date
as may be established pursuant to clause (i)) by reason of the failure of
such party (including for purposes of this Section 13.1(a), in the case of
Buyer, Guarantor, and in the case of Sellers\' Representative, the Company
and each Seller) to perform in all material respects any of its or their
respective covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;   (b) by
the mutual consent of Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative;   (c) by
Buyer, upon a breach of any pre-Closing covenant or agreement on the part of
the Sellers or the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any    
59   representation or warranty of the Sellers or the Company herein shall
be or become untrue in any case such that the conditions set forth in Section
12.1 would not be satisfied (any such breach or occurrence, a "Terminating
Seller Breach"); provided, however, that, if such Terminating Seller Breach
is curable by the Sellers or the Company through the exercise of their
commercially reasonable efforts, and the Sellers or the Company, as
applicable, continue to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts, Buyer
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement under this Section
13.1(c);   (d) by Sellers\' Representative, upon a breach of any covenant or
agreement on the part of Buyer or Guarantor set forth in this Agreement, or
if any representation or warranty of Buyer or Guarantor herein shall be or
become untrue in any case such that the conditions set forth in Section 12.2
would not be satisfied (any such breach or occurrence, a "Terminating Buyer
Breach"); provided, however, that, if such Terminating Buyer Breach is
curable by Buyer or Guarantor through the exercise of their best efforts, and
Buyer or Guarantor, as applicable, continue to exercise such best efforts,
the Sellers\' Representative shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 13.1(d); or   (e) by either Buyer or Sellers\'
Representative, if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Body shall issue any final non-appealable judgment, order or decree or take
such other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or under any other
Transaction Document.   13.2 Procedure for Termination. A party terminating
this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.1 shall give written notice thereof to
each other party hereto, whereupon this Agreement shall terminate and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without further action by
any party. If this Agreement is terminated as permitted by this Section 13,
such termination shall be without liability of any party (or any of its
Affiliates, Representatives or Representatives of its Affiliates) to any
other party to this Agreement; provided, however, that if such termination is
by Buyer pursuant to Section 13.1(a) or (c) as a result of a material breach
by the Company or any Seller of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement, or if such termination is by Sellers\'
Representative pursuant to Section 13.1(a) or (d) as a result of a material
breach by Buyer or Guarantor of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in this Agreement, nothing herein shall affect the non-breaching
party\'s right to (i) Damages on account of such other party\'s breach or
(ii) to compel specific performance of the other parties hereto of their
obligations under this Agreement. Except to the extent appropriate
in connection with enforcing or preserving any rights or obligations it may
have arising out of such termination, in the event that this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby are terminated pursuant to Section 13.1,
this Agreement shall terminate, each party hereto shall return or destroy
all documents and other materials received from the other parties hereto
relating to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and all confidential
information received by each party hereto with respect to any other party
hereto shall be treated in accordance with the terms of Section 8.1
(confidentiality); provided, however, that the provisions set forth in
Section 8.1    60   (confidentiality), Section 8.4 (Non-Solicitation),
Section 9.3 (public announcements), Section 15 (Sellers\' Representative),
Section 16 (Miscellaneous) and this Section 13.2 shall survive any such
termination.   SECTION 14. INDEMNIFICATION   14.1 Indemnification with
respect to Sellers. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 14,
each Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer and its Affiliates (including,
after the Closing, the Company) and each of their respective officers,
directors and shareholders (other than any shareholders of Guarantor) (each
such Person, a "Buyer Indemnified Party") harmless against and in respect of
any and all losses, costs, expenses, claims, damages, obligations and
liabilities, including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements ("Damages"), which such Buyer Indemnified Party has suffered,
incurred or become subject to arising out of, based upon or otherwise in
respect of (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of such Seller
made in Section 3 and (ii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of such
Seller contained in this Agreement.   14.2 Indemnification with respect to
the Company. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 14, each
Seller hereby severally (on a pro rata basis based on such Seller\'s
Ownership Percentage), and not jointly and severally, shall indemnify and
hold each Buyer Indemnified Party harmless against and in respect of any and
all Damages which such Buyer Indemnified Party has suffered, incurred or
become subject to arising out of, based upon or otherwise in respect of:  
(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company made
in Section 4 or Section 10;   (b) any breach of any covenant or obligation
of the Company contained in this Agreement that is to be performed prior to
the Closing;   (c) any amounts owed by the Company or any Subsidiary to
Temple Inland or otherwise related to or arising out of the Temple Inland
Agreement;   (d) a final determination by the IRS that is upheld by a
final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or for
which the time to appeal has expired or a settlement with the IRS in
accordance with Section 10.2(a) of a disallowance by the IRS of all or any
part of the $22,876,964 net operating loss deduction claimed by the Company
and the Subsidiaries on their consolidated federal income tax return (Form
1120) for the taxable year ended February 1, 2003;   (e) any Taxes payable
in respect of a matter listed in Sections 10.1 of the Disclosure Schedule,
other than Taxes for which the Company or any Subsidiary is entitled to
indemnification by Federated Department Stores, Inc. and Taxes to the extent
specific reserves therefor have been established on the Balance Sheet by the
Company;   (f) the release of ammonia at 206 East Depot Street, Marshfield,
Wisconsin that occurred on or about March 21, 2005; and     61    (g)
any fees of any broker or finder employed by the Company, the Sellers, or any
of their respective Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 14.2, the Sellers shall not be required to indemnify with
respect to Tax liabilities for which Federated Department Stores, Inc. is
fully responsible.   14.3 Indemnification by Buyer. Except as otherwise set
forth in this Agreement, Buyer shall, and after the Closing, the Company
shall, indemnify and hold Sellers, their Affiliates, and their respective
officers, directors, members, partners and equityholders (each such Person, a
"Seller Indemnified Party") harmless against and in respect of any and all
Damages which such Seller Indemnified Party has suffered, incurred or become
subject to arising out of, based upon or otherwise in respect of:   (a) any
breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer or Guarantor made in
Section 5;   (b) any breach of any covenant or obligation of Buyer or
Guarantor contained in this Agreement;   (c) any breach of any covenant or
obligation of the Company contained in this Agreement that is to be performed

business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, except to the extent the
foregoing gives rise to an indemnifiable claim pursuant to Section 14.1 or
Section 14.2;   (e) any fees of any broker or finder employed by Buyer,
Guarantor or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby; and   (f) any liabilities incurred in
respect of the WARN Act or similar statutes as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, Buyer shall have no
obligation to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
14.3(f) if the Company\'s representations in Section 4.18(c)(ii) or (iii) are
untrue at Closing.   14.4 Inter-Party Claims. In order for a Buyer
Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party (each, an "Indemnified
Party") to be entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this Section 14,
the Indemnified Party shall, within 20 days after receiving actual notice of
the facts or circumstances forming the basis of such claim, notify the other
party or parties from whom such indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying
Party") in writing specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such claim;
provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect
the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure (except
that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any fees and expenses
incurred during the period in which the Indemnified Party failed to give such
notice in accordance with this    62   Section 14.4). The Indemnified
Party shall thereupon give the Indemnifying Party reasonable access to the
books, records and assets of the Indemnified Party which evidence or support
such claim or the act, omission or occurrence giving rise to such claim and
the right, upon prior notice during normal business hours, to interview any
Representative of the Indemnified Party related thereto.   14.5 Third Party
Claims.   (a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of or involving a claim made by any Person (other than an Indemnifying Party)
against the Indemnified Party, other than a claim pursuant to Section
14.2(c), (d) or (e) (a "Third Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall,
within 20 days after receiving actual notice of the facts or circumstances
forming the basis of such claim, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
the Third Party Claim (which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
events giving rise to such Third Party Claim); provided, however, that
failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have
been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure (except that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any fees and expenses incurred
during the period in which the Indemnified Party failed to give such notice
in accordance with this Section 14.5). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly following the Indemnified
Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including
court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party
Claim.   (b) Except in the case of a Tax Contest (which is covered, instead,
by Section 14.5(d)), or a Temple Inland Matter (which is covered, instead,
by Section 14.5(e)), the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (provided
such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party and which
shall be deemed acceptable if the Indemnified Party does not otherwise notify
the Indemnifying Party within 20 days after having been notified of the
identity thereof) by providing notice to the Indemnified Party within 20 days
after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
14.5(a). If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood and agreed
that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense, and the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other
expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim by providing notice pursuant to this Section 14.5(b), the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of one outside
counsel (and not any fees and expenses allocated to any internal counsel)
employed by the Indemnified Party (which outside counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnifying Party and shall be deemed acceptable if the
Indemnifying Party does not otherwise notify the Indemnified Party within 20
days after having been notified of the identity thereof) for any period
during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof
(other than any period in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to
provide notice of such Third    63   Party Claim as required above). If
the Indemnifying Party elects to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all
the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Party\'s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making employees and Representatives available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Provided that the Indemnifying Party
acknowledges that it is obligated to indemnify the Indemnifying Party with
respect to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third
Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party\'s prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree
to any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third Party Claim, which shall release the Indemnified Party and all of
its Affiliates completely in connection with such Third Party Claim and which
does not impose any continuing material obligations or restrictions on any
Indemnified Party.   (c) The Sellers\' Representative shall act on behalf of
the Sellers for the purposes of this Section 14.5 for any Third Party Claim
or other claim which is the subject of indemnification hereunder.   (d)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Buyer or the Company receives any
written claim or notification which involves the assertion of any claim, or
the commencement of any audit, suit, action or proceeding relating to a
matter that is the subject of the (i) representations or covenants set
forth in Section 10 or (ii) indemnification set forth in Section 14.2(d) or
(e) (in either case, a "Tax Contest"), Buyer shall, within 10 days of
receiving notice of such claim, notify Sellers\' Representative in writing of
such Tax Contest and shall give Sellers\' Representative such information
with respect to the Tax Contest as Sellers\' Representative may reasonably
request. Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative agree that (x) the Sellers\'
Representative shall, at its own expense, continue to participate in and
control the Tax Contest for which the Sellers are providing indemnification
pursuant to Section 14.2(d), and (y) the Sellers\' Representative, at its own
expense, may participate in and, upon notice to Buyer or the Company that
Sellers agree to be liable for, without any contribution from Buyer or the
Company, all amounts owed as a result of any other Tax Contest, assume
control over the defense of any matter at issue in such other Tax Contest. In
connection with any Tax Contest with respect to which the Sellers\'
Representative currently controls or elects to assume control, the Sellers\'
Representative shall, except with respect to items indirectly affecting Taxes
of the Company and the Subsidiaries for which Sellers have not agreed to be
liable and subject to Buyer\'s right to consent contained in the
eighth sentence of this Section 14.5(d), have the exclusive power to contest,
settle, prosecute, defend and make decisions and elections in respect of such
Tax Contest, and determine the manner in which the prosecution or defense
is conducted, the contest or settlement occurs, or the decisions or elections
are made, in each case without the participation of Buyer or the Company. At
no time shall Buyer or the Company settle or otherwise compromise, prosecute
or defend without the prior written consent of the Sellers\' Representative,
any Tax Contest of    64   which Sellers\' Representative assumes or
continues control in accordance with this Section 14.5(d) and any settlement
or compromise made by Buyer or the Company with respect to such Tax Contest
shall not be effective and shall be null and void with respect to the
Sellers. Sellers\' Representative may discharge, at any time, Sellers\'
indemnity obligations with respect to a Tax Contest by paying Buyer or the
Company the amount of the applicable Damages, calculated as of the date of
such payment. Each of the parties hereto and their respective Representatives
shall cooperate with each other party hereto and their respective
Representatives, as reasonably requested thereby, in the prosecution,
defense, settlement or contest of any Tax Contest. Buyer and the Company
agree to promptly provide the Sellers\' Representative with all notices and
other correspondence and information received by Buyer or the Company
with respect to any Tax Contest. Buyer and the Company hereby grant any
Tax practitioner retained by the Sellers\' Representative, in connection with
any Tax Contest of which Sellers\' Representative assumes or continues
control in accordance with this Section 14.5(d), with power of attorney to
act on behalf of Buyer and the Company in respect of such Tax Contest;
provided, however, that the terms of any settlement or agreement, to the
extent such settlement or agreement provides that Buyer or the Company take
or refrain from taking any actions or make any payments for which Buyer is
not fully indemnified pursuant to Section 14.2, shall be on terms and
conditions reasonably acceptable to Buyer and, if applicable, the Company.
Buyer hereby agrees to provide, or cause the Company to provide, to the
Sellers\' Representative a separate power of attorney granting the Sellers\'
Representative the power to control a particular Tax Contest in the manner
set forth in this Agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative.   (e) In the event Buyer or the
Company receives any written claim or notification which involves the
assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding
relating to the matter that is the subject of the indemnification set forth
in Section 14.2(c) (a "Temple Inland Matter"), Buyer shall, within 10 days of
receiving notice of such claim, notify Sellers\' Representative in writing of
such Temple Inland Matter and shall provide the Sellers\' Representative with
such information with respect to such Temple Inland Matter as Sellers\'
Representative may reasonably request. Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative
agree that the Sellers\' Representative shall, at its own
expense, exclusively control any Temple Inland Matter. Sellers\'
Representative shall have, subject to Buyer\'s right to consent contained in
the seventh sentence of this Section 14.5(e), the exclusive power to contest,
settle, prosecute, defend, and make all decisions and elections in respect of
any Temple Inland Matter and determine the manner in which the prosecution or
defense is conducted, the contest or settlement occurs, or the decisions or
election are made, in each case without the participation of Buyer or the
Company. At no time shall Buyer or the Company settle or otherwise
compromise, prosecute or defend, without the prior written consent of the
Sellers\' Representative, any Temple Inland Matter, and any settlement or
compromise made by Buyer or the Company with respect to such Temple Inland
Matter shall not be effective and shall be null and void with respect to the
Sellers. Each of the parties hereto and their respective Representatives
shall cooperate with the Sellers\' Representative and its Representatives, as
reasonably requested thereby, in the prosecution, defense, settlement or
contest of any Temple Inland Matter. Buyer and the Company agree to promptly
provide the Sellers\' Representative with all notices and
other correspondence and information received by    65   Buyer or the
Company with respect to any Temple Inland Matter. Buyer and the Company
hereby grant the Sellers\' Representative with full power of attorney to act
on behalf of Buyer and the Company in respect of such Temple Inland
Matter; provided, however, that the terms of any such settlement or
agreement, to the extent such settlement or agreement provides that Buyer,
the Company or any Subsidiary take or refrain from taking any actions or make
any payments for which Buyer is not fully indemnified pursuant to Section
14.2 shall be on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to Buyer. Buyer
hereby agrees to provide, or cause the Company to provide, to the Sellers\'
Representative a separate power of attorney granting the Sellers\'
Representative the power to control a particular Temple Inland Matter in the
manner set forth in this Agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative.   14.6 Limitations
and Requirements.   From and after the Closing:   (a) Sellers shall have
no obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties against Damages (i)
pursuant to Section 14.1(i) or 14.2(a) arising out of or based upon any
breach of any representation or warranty made in or pursuant to this
Agreement (A) unless the Damages related to any such breach (including
multiple conditions or events that arise out of or are based upon such
breach) are greater than $10,000 (the "Individual Threshold") and (B) unless
and until the aggregate of all such Damages (other than Damages that fail to
exceed the Individual Threshold) suffered or incurred by all such
Buyer Indemnified Parties exceeds $1,000,000, in which event, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification in the full amount
of such excess; provided, however, that the above limitations shall not be
applicable to any claim for Damages based upon a breach of any representation
or warranty made in Sections 3.2, 3.4, 4.2, 4.4, or 10.1 hereof.   (b) In
the absence of fraud, Sellers shall not be obligated to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties against Damages pursuant to:   (i) Section 14.1(i) or
Section 14.2(a), (e) or (f) to the extent that  payments thereof by or on
behalf of Sellers to the Buyer Indemnified  Parties pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement exceed the General Escrow  Amount; provided, however, that the
limitations set forth in this Section  14.6(b)(i) shall not apply to any
breach of any representation or warranty  made in Sections 3.2, 3.4, 4.2, or
4.4 hereof, the limitations with respect  to which are set forth in clause
(ii) of this Section 14.6(b);   (ii) Section 14.1(i) or 14.2(a) if such
claim is based on a breach of  any representation or warranty made in
Sections 3.2, 3.4, 4.2, or 4.4, or  pursuant to Section 14.1(ii), or Sections
14.2(b) or (g), in each case to  the extent that payments thereof by or on
behalf of Sellers to the Buyer  Indemnified Parties pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement exceed the  Purchase Price;     66    (iii) Section
14.2(d), to the extent that payments thereof by or on  behalf of Sellers to
the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to the terms of  this Agreement exceed
the Tax Escrow Amount; and   (iv) Section 14.2(c), to the extent that
payments thereof by or on  behalf of Sellers to the Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to the terms of  this Agreement exceed the T-I Escrow Amount;  
provided, however, that the aggregate of all amounts paid to the Buyer 
Indemnified Parties pursuant to claims made under Section 14.1 and Section 
14.2 shall not exceed the Purchase Price.   (c) Except as may otherwise
expressly be provided in this Agreement or any Transaction Document, no claim
for indemnification pursuant to this Section 14 may or shall be made unless
such claim arises and written notice pursuant to Section 14.4 or Section
14.5, as applicable, is delivered to the Indemnifying Party in accordance
with Section 14.8.   (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
except as set forth in Section 14.1, no Seller shall in any way be liable for
any amount in excess of such Seller\'s Ownership Percentage of any Damages
and the aggregate liability of any Seller under this Section 14 for any
Damages, as further limited under this Section 14.6(d), shall in no event
exceed the aggregate amount of the portion of the Aggregate Cash Proceeds,
the Specified Employees Bonus Amount and the Accrued Dividend Amount paid to
the Sellers\' Representative, the Escrow Agent and the Reserve Account on
behalf of such Seller pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, no Seller shall be liable or responsible,
directly or indirectly, for any Damages for any breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant made by any other Seller. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall
have any right to indemnification under Section 14.2(a) with respect to any
Damages to the extent specifically accrued for in the Balance Sheet or the
Interim Balance Sheet; provided however, that this limitation shall not apply
to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 14.2(b)-(g).   (e) The
Sellers and Buyer acknowledge, on their behalf and, in the case of Buyer, on
behalf of the other Buyer Indemnified Parties that, after the Closing, their
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth
in this Section 14 (other than claims and causes of action based on fraud);
provided that this shall not affect the right of any party to seek or obtain
specific performance or other equitable remedies.   (f) Upon payment in
full of any Inter-Party Claim pursuant to Section 14.4 or the payment of any
judgment or settlement with respect to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to the rights of the
Indemnified Party against any Person (other than the Buyer Indemnified
Parties) with respect to the subject matter of such Indemnification Claim or
Third Party Claim; provided,    67   however, that such Person is not
then or projected to be a customer or supplier of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Indemnified Parties shall assign or otherwise reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnifying Parties to pursue any claims against, or
otherwise recover amounts from, any Person liable or responsible for any
Damages for which indemnification has been received pursuant to this
Agreement.   14.7 Calculation and Mitigation of Damages.   (a) The amount
of any Damages for which indemnification is provided under this Section 14
shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by such Indemnified Party
under insurance policies or other collateral sources with respect to such
Damages. In the event any amounts recovered or recoverable under insurance
policies or other collateral sources are not received before any claim for
indemnification is paid pursuant to this Section 14, then the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts to pursue
such insurance policies or collateral sources, and in the event the Buyer
Indemnified Parties receive any recovery, the amount of such recovery shall
be applied first, to reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Parties for their out-
of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and expenses)
expended in pursuing such recovery, second, to refund any payments made by
the Sellers which would not have been so paid had such recovery been obtained
prior to such payment, and third, any excess to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties.   (b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, "Damages" shall not include any consequential, incidental or
indirect damages, special or punitive damages, including loss of revenue,
profits or income, except to the extent paid to a third party. In valuing a
"Damage," no adjustment shall be made as a result of any multiplier of the
Company\'s or any other Person\'s earnings before interest, Tax, depreciation
or amortization (or any similar valuation metric), or any other premium over
fair market, book or historical value which may have been paid by Buyer for
the securities whether or not such multiple, increase factor or other premium
had been used by Buyer at the time of, or in connection with, calculating or
preparing its bid, its proposed purchase price or its final purchase price
for the Company and its Subsidiaries. For purposes of clarification, the
amount of actual Damages to which an Indemnified Party may be entitled to
recover pursuant to this Section 14 in respect of a breach by an Indemnifying
Party, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, of a
representation or warranty that is qualified by materiality, shall not be
reduced solely due to the fact that such representation or warranty was so
qualified; provided, however, that neither the terms of this sentence nor any
other provision hereunder shall have the effect of changing, amending or
modifying any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement (or any
other term or provision contained in this Agreement) for any purpose
hereunder, including but not limited to whether any breach of any such
representation or warranty qualified by materiality hereunder is subject
to the limitations or thresholds set forth in this Section 14; and
provided further, however, that the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
any representation or warranty hereunder that is qualified by materiality
shall remain so qualified by materiality when determining whether any
such representation or warranty was breached.     68    (c) Each party
shall use reasonable commercial efforts to mitigate its Damages (including,
to the extent consistent with sound business judgment, incurring costs only
to the minimum extent necessary to remedy the breach which gives rise to the
Damages) upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected
to, or does, give rise thereto.   (d) The amount of Damages with respect to
which an Indemnified Party is to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 14
shall initially be determined without regard to any income Tax benefit, and
the indemnification payment shall be made on such basis. To the extent,
however, that the Indemnified Party recognizes a net income Tax benefit with
respect to any Damages for which payment is made hereunder, after taking into
account the income Tax effect, if any, of such indemnification payment (such
net income Tax benefit is referred to hereafter as a "Net Tax Benefit"), such
Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the amount of such Net
Tax Benefit (but not, in any event, in an amount in excess of the
indemnification payment actually received from such Indemnifying Party with
respect to such Damages) at such time or times as and to the extent that such
Indemnified Party or any Affiliate of such Indemnified Party
actually realizes such Tax Benefit through a refund or a reduction in income
Tax otherwise payable, calculated by computing the amount of income Taxes
before and after taking into account any Tax items attributable to such
Damage and the indemnification payment with respect to such Damage; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party may, if it reasonably determines based on
an opinion of counsel (other than internal counsel) that there is a
substantial risk of a disallowance of a Net Tax Benefit claimed, elect, on
notice to the Sellers\' Representative or Buyer, as the case may be, to
withhold payment to the Indemnifying Party of such Net Tax Benefit until such
time as the relevant taxable year has been closed or the uncertainty
regarding such Net Tax Benefit otherwise resolved, during which time such Net
Tax Benefit shall bear interest at the rate applicable to federal income tax
overpayments, except that no such deferral of payment shall be made in the
event that the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party a
"will" opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to
the effect that such Net Tax Benefit will be sustained.   14.8 Termination
of Indemnification.   The obligations of Sellers to indemnify and hold
harmless any Buyer Indemnified Party under this Section 14 shall terminate
(i) when the applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant to
Section 16.1, with respect to claims made pursuant to Section 14.1(i) and
Section 14.2(a), (ii) 15 days after the date on which the obligations of the
Sellers under a particular covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
are terminated or expire pursuant to the terms of such covenant or agreement,
with respect to claims made under Section 14.1(ii), (iii) 90 days after the
Closing Date, with respect to claims made under Section 14.2(b), (iv) 15 days
after the date on which Buyer receives the fully executed and effective T-I
Release (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer), with
respect to claims made under Section 14.2(c), (v) with respect to any claims
made pursuant to Section 14.2(d), 15 days after the earliest to occur of (A)
the 15 month anniversary of the date hereof, (B) if any claim or assessment
is made giving rise to a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
14.2(d), the date on which any such claim or assessment is paid or otherwise
is    69   satisfied in full, (C) the date on which the Company receives
a letter from the IRS National Office (or otherwise from a Washington, D.C.
office of the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of the Treasury or a
person who works in any such office) that states that the tax return for the
Company\'s 2002 fiscal year is acceptable in the form filed (or words to
substantially the same effect) or otherwise expressly states that there are
no issues concerning the matters set forth in Section 14.2(d), or (D) in the
event that the Company receives a letter from an IRS field supervisor,
director of field operations or other person of similar, or more senior,
supervisory title or authority (or a letter that is signed on behalf of the
IRS, which has greater force than a field agent\'s letter) or the IRS Service
Center or Regional Office located in Ogden, Utah (or otherwise from a person
who works in any such office), in either case that is authorized by a person
more senior in status than the director of field operations at the Tucson,
Arizona office, and that states that such return is acceptable in the form
filed (or words to substantially the same effect) or otherwise expressly
states that there are no issues concerning the matters set forth in Section
14.2(d), the later of (x) the date of such letter or (y) the six month
anniversary of the date hereof, (vi) 15 days after the earlier of (A) the 15
month anniversary of the Closing Date and (B) the later of (x) the date final
settlement of the claim is entered into or (y) the date a final, non-
appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is made,
with respect to claims made pursuant to Section 14.2(e); and (vii) 15 days
after the 15 month anniversary of the Closing Date with respect to claims
made pursuant to Section 14.2(f) or 14.2(g); provided, however, in each case,
that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with
respect to any item as to which an Indemnified Party shall have, before the
expiration of the applicable period, previously made a claim by delivering a
notice of such claim pursuant to Section 14.4 or Section 14.5 to the
Sellers\' Representative. No Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right to
assert any claim against any Seller with respect to any matter unless the
Buyer Indemnified Party determines that there is a reasonable basis for a
bona fide claim for indemnification hereunder and provides notice thereof
pursuant to Section 14.4 or Section 14.5 within the time periods set forth
above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the obligations of the Sellers to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Section 14 shall terminate upon the
earlier to occur of (i) the consummation of a sale of (A) greater than fifty-
one percent (51%) of the capital stock of (x) the Company or (y)
substantially all of the Company\'s Subsidiaries (whether by merger or
otherwise) or (B) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in one or more related transactions or (ii)
the initial public offering of the capital stock of the Company.   14.9
Escrow Accounts.   (a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from
and after the Closing, any indemnification by any Seller for Damages pursuant
to Section 14.1(i), Section 14.2(a), (e) or (f) shall, and any
indemnification for Damages pursuant to Section 14.1(ii) or Section 14.2(b)
or (g) may, be paid first, to the extent applicable, from the General Escrow
Amount pursuant to the terms of the General Escrow Agreement, and, only after
all of such funds have been paid to a Buyer Indemnified Party or released and
returned to the Sellers and, if applicable, second, directly by the
Sellers.     70    (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
from and after the Closing, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
Damages in excess of the Tax Escrow Amount with respect to any claim for
indemnification made pursuant to Section 14.2(d). Buyer further acknowledges
that on or prior to the date on which the Tax Escrow Agreement is terminated,
any Damages to which a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled pursuant to a
claim made pursuant to Section 14.2(d) shall be satisfied solely from the Tax
Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of the Tax Escrow Agreement, and during
such period, no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to, and the Buyer
Indemnified Parties hereby waive all rights to, seek Damages directly from
any Seller or the Sellers\' Representative in connection with any claim for
indemnification made pursuant to Section 14.2(d). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, upon termination of the Tax Escrow Agreement, any
Damages to which a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled pursuant to a claim
made pursuant to Section 14.2(d) may be sought directly from the Sellers
until termination of the period during which such claims may be made pursuant
to Section 14.8.   (c) Except as provided herein, from and after the
Closing, any Damages to which a Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled pursuant
to a claim made pursuant to Section 14.2(c) shall be satisfied solely from
the T-I Escrow Amount pursuant to the terms of the Temple Inland Escrow
Agreement, and no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to Damages in
excess of the T-I Escrow Amount with respect to any Claim for indemnification
made pursuant to Section 14.2(c). Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that
no Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to, and the Buyer Indemnified
Parties hereby waive all rights to, seek Damages directly from any Seller or
the Sellers\' Representative in connection with any claim for indemnification
made pursuant to Section 14.2(c).   SECTION 15. THE SELLERS\'
REPRESENTATIVE   15.1 The Sellers\' Representative.   (a) Each of the
Sellers does hereby irrevocably make, constitute and appoint the Sellers\'
Representative as his, her or its agent, to act in his or her or its name,
place and stead, as such Seller\'s attorney-in-fact, to (i) execute and
deliver all documents necessary or desirable to carry out the intent of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (including in the name of, or
on behalf of, such Seller), (ii) make all elections or decisions entered
into in connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents,
(iii) hold such Seller\'s Securities and transfer such Seller\'s Securities
to Buyer on the Closing Date, (iv) act on such Seller\'s behalf in connection
with all obligations and agreements of the Sellers under the Seller
Transaction Documents, (v) amend, waive or other change the terms or
conditions of this Agreement or any other Transaction Document on behalf of
such Seller, (vi) defend, settle and make payments to the Buyer Indemnified
Parties on behalf of such Seller in connection with any claim for
indemnification made by any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 14
and to initiate and prosecute any claim for indemnification made by or on
behalf of such Seller pursuant to Section 14, (vii) receive any payments of
the Purchase Price or other amounts due to such Seller under the Seller
Transaction Documents, direct any portion of such amounts to any escrow
account or the Reserve Account and to retain such amounts in such accounts
for so long as Sellers\'    71   Representative shall determine, (viii)
give and receive on behalf of Sellers any and all notices from or to any
Seller or Sellers under the Transaction Documents, (ix) incorporate
corporations, organize partnerships, organize limited liability companies on
behalf of the Sellers and take all actions in connection therewith
(including, but not limiting to, the transfer of any assets or liabilities of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to which the Sellers are entitled or
responsible for satisfying pursuant to the terms of the
Transaction Documents), and (x) otherwise exercise all rights of such Sellers
and otherwise act on behalf of such Seller under the Transaction Documents
and in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, in each case as if such Seller had personally done
such act, and the Sellers\' Representative hereby accepts such appointment.
Any proceeds received by the Sellers\' Representative from Buyer or Guarantor
on behalf of the Sellers shall be distributed to the Sellers as promptly as
practicable by the Sellers\' Representative, in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. The death,
incapacity, dissolution, liquidation, insolvency or bankruptcy of any Seller
shall not terminate such appointment or the authority and agency of the
Sellers\' Representative. The power-of-attorney granted in this Section 15.1
is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.   (b) The Sellers\'
Representative shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in
relying, upon any statements furnished to it by any Seller, Buyer, Guarantor,
any third Person or any other evidence deemed by the Sellers\' Representative
to be reliable, and the Sellers\' Representative shall be entitled to act on
the advice of counsel selected by it. The Sellers\' Representative shall be
fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document unless it shall have
received such advice or concurrence of such Sellers as it deems appropriate
or it shall have been expressly jointly and severally indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Sellers appointing it against any and all Damages and
other liabilities and expenses that the Sellers\' Representative may incur by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.   (c) The Sellers\'
Representative shall be entitled to retain counsel acceptable to it and to
incur such expenses as the Sellers\' Representative deems to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with its performance of its obligations under this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, and all such fees and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) incurred by the
Sellers\' Representative shall be a Transaction Expense or otherwise shall be
jointly and severally borne by each Seller. The Sellers\' Representative
shall have the right to deduct any reimbursement amounts payable to the
Sellers\' Representative pursuant to this Section 15.1 from any
reserve account established and maintained by the Sellers\' Representative in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Reserve Account")
without any prior or further approval from the Sellers.   (d) The Sellers
hereby agree to jointly and severally indemnify the Sellers\' Representative
(in its capacity as such) against, and to hold the Sellers\' Representative
(in its capacity as such) harmless from, any and all Damages and other
liabilities and expenses of whatever kind which may at any time be imposed
upon, incurred by or asserted against the Sellers\' Representative in such
capacity in any way relating to or    72   arising out of its action or
failures to take action pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document.   (e) J.P. Morgan Partners (BHCA), L.P. shall be the initial
Sellers\' Representative and shall serve as the Sellers\' Representative
until its resignation. Upon the resignation of J.P. Morgan Partners (BHCA),
L.P., the Sellers representing a majority of the aggregate Ownership
Percentages of all Sellers shall select a new Sellers\' Representative. Each
time a new Sellers\' Representative is appointed pursuant to this Agreement,
such Person, as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of such
appointment, shall accept such position in writing.   (f) The provisions of
this Section 15 shall in no way impose any obligations on Buyer or Guarantor.
In particular, notwithstanding any notice received by Buyer or Guarantor to
the contrary, and absent bad faith or willful misconduct, Buyer (i) shall be
fully protected in relying upon and shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall
have no liability to the Sellers with respect to, actions, decisions and
determinations of the Sellers\' Representative and (ii) shall be entitled to
assume that all actions, decisions and determinations of the Sellers\'
Representative are fully authorized by all of the Sellers.   15.2 No
Reliance. The decision of each Seller to sell Securities pursuant to this
Agreement has been made by such Seller independently of any other Seller and

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder may be assigned, by operation of Law or otherwise, by
any party hereto to any other Person without the prior written consent of
Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative, and any such attempted assignment
shall be null and void; provided, however, that (i) Buyer may assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement in whole or in part to any
Affiliates without the prior written consent of the Sellers (provided that
Buyer and Guarantor shall remain primarily liable hereunder following any
such assignment), (ii) any Principal Stockholder may assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates without the prior
written consent of Buyer (provided that such Principal Stockholder shall
remain primarily liable hereunder) and (iii) the Company and Buyer may grant
a security interest in its rights under this Agreement and any other
Transaction Document to its lenders. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement
and the rights and obligations set forth herein shall inure to the benefit
of, and be binding upon, the parties hereto, and each of their respective
successors, heirs, and assigns.    16.5 Amendment, Modification and Waiver.
Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by Buyer and the
Sellers\' Representative. Any such amendment, modification, extension or
waiver shall be in writing. The waiver by a party of any breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not constitute or operate as a waiver of
any other breach of such provision or of any other provision hereof, nor
shall any failure to enforce any provision hereof operate as a waiver of such
provision or of any other provision hereof. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Law.   16.6 Governing Law. This Agreement is made
pursuant to, and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws
of State of New York (and the United States federal law, to the extent
applicable), irrespective of the principal place of business, residence or
domicile of the parties hereto, and without giving effect to otherwise
applicable principles of conflicts of Law.     75    16.7 Waiver of
Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY
PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF ANY CLAIM, ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER AGREEMENTS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 16.7.   16.8 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each
party hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of (a) the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County and (b) the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, for purposes of
any claim, action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby. Each party hereto agrees to commence any
such claim, action or proceeding only in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York or, if such claim, action or proceeding
cannot be brought in such court for jurisdictional reasons, in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, New York County. Each of the parties hereby
waives, and agrees not to assert in any such dispute, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (a) such party is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, (b) such party and such party\'s
property is immune from any legal process issued by such courts or (c) any
claim, action or proceeding commenced in such courts is brought in
an inconvenient forum. Each party hereto further agrees that service of
any process, summons, notice or document by United States registered mail to
such party\'s address set forth in Section 16.3 above shall be effective
service of process for any claim, action or proceeding with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction in this Section 16.8 or
otherwise.   16.9 Section Headings and Defined Terms. The section headings
contained herein are for reference purposes only and shall not in any way
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The terms defined
herein and in any other Transaction Document include the plural as well as
the singular and the singular as well as the plural. Except as otherwise
indicated, all agreements defined herein refer to the same as from time to
time amended or supplemented or the terms thereof waived or modified in
accordance herewith and therewith. All references to "$" or "dollars" shall
be to United States dollars and all references to "days" shall be to calendar
days unless otherwise specified.   16.10 Severability. If any term or other
provision of this Agreement (or portion thereof) or the application of any
such term or other provision (or portion thereof) to any Person or
circumstance is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced pursuant to any applicable
Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement (or
remaining portion of such term or other    76   provision) will
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination by a
court of competent jurisdiction that any term or other provision (or portion
thereof) of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated
hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.   16.11 Counterparts; Third-
Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, including by facsimile transmission, each of which shall be
deemed an original; and any Person may become a party hereto by executing a
counterpart hereof, but all of such counterparts together shall be deemed to
be one and the same agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any other Person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.   16.12 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the
Disclosure Schedule, the General Escrow Agreement, the Tax Escrow Agreement,
the Temple Inland Escrow Agreement and the agreements, exhibits, schedules
and certificates referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, constitute
the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the purchase
and sale of the Securities and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof, including the letter of intent dated as of
February 2005 between J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC and Guarantor and the
Transaction Summary dated as of May 11, 2005 by and among the Company,
Guarantor and J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC.   16.13 Guaranty. Guarantor hereby
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as principal obligor,
and not merely as surety, to the Sellers and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, the due and punctual payment in full of the Purchase Price
and all other obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, the General Escrow
Agreement, the Tax Escrow Agreement, the Temple Inland Escrow Agreement and
each other agreement entered into in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including, without limitation, Buyer\'s
indemnification obligations under Section 14 (collectively, the
"Obligations"). The foregoing obligation of Guarantor constitutes a
continuing guaranty of payment, and not of collection, and is and shall be
absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances, including without
limitation, circumstances which might otherwise constitute a legal
or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor. The obligation of
Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged, impaired or otherwise affected
by the failure of any Seller to assert any claim or demand against Buyer or
to enforce any remedy hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing
in this Section 16.13 shall create any liabilities or obligations for
Guarantor to the extent Buyer would not have liability or otherwise be
responsible to any Seller hereunder and (ii) Guarantor shall have the right
to assert as a defense (including rights of set off and counterclaim) to any
of its obligations hereunder any defense that would be available to it had it
duly authorized and entered into the Obligations directly. Guarantor hereby
expressly agrees to the terms of Section 16.7 and Section 16.8 and
acknowledges that such Sections personally bind Guarantor.     77
