Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired
without any conversion thereof pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all Company Options that remain
outstanding and unexercised at such time shall vest, to the extent then-
unvested. Each Company Option that is outstanding and which has not been
exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be terminated at
the Effective Time and each holder of one or more such terminated Company
Options (each, a " _Company Optionholder_ " and collectively with the Company
Stockholders, the " _Company Equityholders_ ") shall be entitled to receive,
in full settlement and cancellation thereof, the applicable Option
Consideration (if any), it being understood that if the Option Consideration
with respect to any Company Option is zero or a negative number, then the
holder of such Company Option shall not be entitled to receive any
consideration in respect of such Company Option or the termination thereof.
Payments of Option Consideration shall be made in accordance with _Section
3.2(d)_. Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company
(the " _Board_ ") shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take such other
actions as may be necessary to effect the provisions of this _Section
3.1(d)_.

 

(e) Each issued and outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of the common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



17 3.2 _Payments and Submission of Transmittal Letters_.

 

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall pay to an exchange
agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") selected by the Company at least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date and reasonably acceptable to Parent,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an aggregate amount (the "
_Funding Amount_ ") necessary to pay to each Company Stockholder (other than
any Dissenting Stockholders) the applicable Common Merger Consideration to
which such Company Stockholder is entitled hereunder.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall mail or otherwise deliver to
each Company Stockholder a letter of transmittal, substantially in the form
of _Exhibit D_ (the " _Transmittal Letter_ "), which shall specify, among
other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the certificates representing Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ")
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent. In
the event that, prior to the Closing Date, a Company Stockholder surrenders a
Certificate or affidavit of loss to the Exchange Agent, together with
delivery of a Transmittal Letter, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, such Company Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor payment at the Closing of the
applicable portion of the Common Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
3.1(b)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
Following the Closing, upon surrender of a Certificate or affidavit of loss to
the Exchange Agent, together with delivery of such Transmittal Letter, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the applicable Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor payment, as soon as reasonably practicable, of the applicable
portion of the Common Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

 

(c) Promptly following the date which is one year after the Closing Date,
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent all cash,
Transmittal Letters and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the Exchange Agents duties shall
terminate. Thereafter, each Company Stockholder may deliver Transmittal
Letters to Parent and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and
similar Laws) receive in consideration therefor, and Parent shall promptly
pay, the applicable portion of the Common Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof as determined in accordance with this _Article III_.

(d) Each Company Optionholder shall be entitled to receive on the next payroll
payment date following the Closing (but in no event more than 15 days after
the Closing Date), in exchange for the Company Options held by such Company
Optionholder immediately prior to the Effective Time, payment of the
applicable Option Consideration (subject to _Section 3.10_) that such
Company Optionholder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_.

(e) If the Common Merger Consideration payable to a Company Stockholder is to
be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the relevant
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition to the payment of such amount that the Certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and
otherwise be in proper form for transfer.

 



18 (f) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Company
Stockholder claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in such
form and containing such substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, Parent
will pay (or cause the Exchange Agent to pay) in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable portion of the Common Merger
Consideration to be paid with respect thereto, subject to the terms and
conditions in this _Article III_.

 

3.3 _Dissenter s Rights_.

 

(a) Any shares of Company Common Stock held by a Company Stockholder who has
complied with all applicable provisions of Article 113 of Title 7 of the CBCA
(the " _Dissenter s Rights Statute_"), properly exercised dissenters rights
thereunder with respect to such holders shares of Company Common Stock, and
not effectively withdrawn or lost (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
such dissenters rights (such shares collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_
"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the applicable
portion of the Common Merger Consideration as set forth in _Section 3.1_
hereof or the contingent right to receive any other amounts payable to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to _Sections 3.5(d)_ , _3.5(e)_ , _3.6(a)_ , or
_11.2_ , but the holder thereof (each a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall
only be entitled to such rights as are provided by the CBCA.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 3.3(a)_ hereof, in the event
that, prior to the Determination Date, any Dissenting Stockholder shall
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) such
Dissenting Stockholders dissenters rights with respect to such shares under
the Dissenters Rights Statute, then, as of the later of the Effective Time
and the occurrence of such event, such shares shall automatically be converted
into and represent only the right to receive the applicable portion of the
Common Merger Consideration set forth in and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, upon surrender of the Certificate(s) formerly representing such
shares, and such formerly Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to any
applicable amounts otherwise payable to the Company Stockholders pursuant to
_Sections 3.5(d)_ , _3.5(e)_ , _3.6(a)_ , or _11.2_.

 

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demand for payment,
any notice of intent to demand payment, or any other assertion of dissenters
or appraisal rights, whether under the Dissenters Rights Statute or otherwise
(collectively, the " _Dissenter Demands_ ") and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such
Dissenter Demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make any payment with respect to any such Dissenter Demands or
offer or agree to settle or settle any such Dissenter Demands.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article III_ to the contrary, in
the event that, as of the Determination Date, there are any Dissenting Shares
held by a Dissenting Stockholder that does not effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) such Dissenting
Stockholders dissenters rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares under
the Dissenters Rights Statute, then (i) from and after the Effective Time,
all Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be deemed to be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Dissenting
Shareholder shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Dissenting

 



19  Shares, except any right that such Dissenting Holder may have to receive
payment therefor pursuant to the Dissenters Rights Statute, (ii) any payment
by Parent that would have been required to have been paid to any such
Dissenting Stockholder (assuming, for this purpose, that such Dissenting
Stockholder had not exercised dissenters rights) under this Agreement shall
be retained by Parent, and (iii) any amounts otherwise payable to such
Dissenting Stockholder in respect of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to
_Sections 3.5(d)_ , _3.5(e)_ , _3.6(a)_ , or _11.2_ shall be payable to Parent
in lieu of such Dissenting Stockholder, and the Dissenting Stockholders sole
remedies shall be as provided under the Dissenters Rights Statute. Each
Dissenting Shareholder holding of record or beneficially owning Dissenting
Shares who becomes entitled under the CBCA to payment with respect to such
Dissenting Shares shall receive payment therefor from the Surviving
Corporation.

3.4 _Estimated Aggregate Consideration; Estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount; Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness; Estimated Closing Date
Cash_.

(a) Subject to the adjustments set forth in _Section 3.5_, the " _Estimated
Aggregate Consideration_ " shall consist of One Billion One Hundred Million
Dollars ($1,100,000,000), _plus_ (i) the Estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, _less_ (ii) Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, _plus_
(iii) Estimated Closing Date Cash, _less_ (iv) the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, _less_ (v) the Adjustment Escrow Amount, and  _less_ (vi) the
Outstanding Company Expenses paid by Parent at Closing in accordance with
_Section 3.8_.

(b) Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and in no
event more than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent (i) an estimate of the unaudited consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the
Closing Date, and (ii) a written statement setting forth (A) its good faith
estimate of (1) Estimated Aggregate Consideration, (2) Closing Date Net
Working Capital (" _Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital_ "), (3)
Closing Date Indebtedness (" _Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness_ "), (4)
Closing Date Cash (" _Estimated Closing Date Cash_ ") and (5) Outstanding
Company Expenses, (B) the Companys calculation of the Estimated Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount, and (C) each Company Equityholders Pro Rata
Percentage, Common Pro Rata Percentage and Option Pro Rata Percentage, as
applicable.

3.5 _Adjustment Amount_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within 75 days thereof, Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Holder
Representative (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a calculation of Net Working Capital as of
the close of business on the Closing Date (" _Closing Date Net Working
Capital_ "), (iii) a calculation of the aggregate amount of all Indebtedness
of the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date (" _Closing
Date Indebtedness_ ") and (iv) a calculation of Cash and Cash Equivalents of
the Company as of the close of business on the Closing Date (" _Closing Date
Cash_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of Closing Date Net
Working Capital shall be prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "), applied using the same accounting
methods, practices, principles, policies and 

 



20  procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and valuation and
estimation methodologies that were used by the Company in the preparation of
the 2014 Financial Statements and not taking into account any of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes
of calculating Closing Date Net Working Capital, current assets shall exclude
any inventory SKU that has not been sold within the last 12 months and is not
returnable, net of any inventory reserve. Following Parents delivery of the
Closing Balance Sheet, Parent shall provide the Holder Representative and its
representatives reasonable access to the relevant records, personnel
and (subject to the execution of customary work paper access letters if
requested) accountants of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and shall cause the
relevant knowledgeable personnel of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with the Holder Representative in
connection with its review of the Closing Balance Sheet, it being understood
that such access shall be provided and cooperation given only when the Holder
Representative is reviewing the Closing Balance Sheet. The Auditor shall
resolve any dispute between Parent and the Holder Representative as to whether
appropriate access has been provided and cooperation given under this 
_Section 3.5(a)_.

(b) If the Holder Representative shall disagree with the calculation of
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness and/or Closing
Date Cash, it shall notify Parent of such disagreement in writing, setting
forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement and its
calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness
and/or Closing Date Cash, within 30 days after its receipt of the Closing
Balance Sheet. In the event that the Holder Representative does not provide
such a notice of disagreement within such 30-day period, the Holder
Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance Sheet and
the calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness
and Closing Date Cash delivered by Parent which shall be final, binding and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any such notice of
disagreement is timely provided, Parent and the Holder Representative shall
use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of 30 days (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any disagreements with respect
to the calculations of Closing Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date
Indebtedness and/or Closing Date Cash. If, at the end of such period, they are
unable to resolve such disagreements, then Grant Thornton LLP (or, if Grant
Thornton LLP declines or is unable to serve such role, such other independent
accounting or financial consulting firm of recognized national standing as may
be mutually selected by Parent and the Holder Representative) (the "
_Auditor_ ") shall resolve any disagreements that were presented in the Holder
Representatives notice of disagreement and remain unresolved. Each of Parent
and the Holder Representative shall promptly after engagement of the Auditor
provide their assertions regarding the Closing Date Net Working Capital,
Closing Date Indebtedness, and/or Closing Date Cash and, to the extent
relevant thereto, the Closing Balance Sheet in writing to the Auditor and to
each other. The Auditor shall be instructed to render its determination with
respect to such disagreements as soon as reasonably practicable (which the
Parties agree shall not be later than the later of the date that is 45 days
following the day on which the Auditor is retained or the date provided in
the Auditors engagement letter). The Auditor shall base its determination
solely on (i) the written submission of the Parties and shall not conduct an
independent investigation and (ii) the extent (if any) to which the Closing
Date Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, and/or Closing Date Cash
require adjustment (only with respect to the remaining disagreements that were
included in the Holder Representatives notice of 

 



21  disagreement and submitted to the Auditor) in order to be determined in
accordance with _Section 3.5(a)_ (including the definitions of the defined
terms used in  _Section 3.5(a)_). The determination of the Auditor for each
item of disagreement submitted to it shall (x) be within the range of values
assigned to such item by Parent and the Holder Representative in their
respective written assertions to the Auditor and (y) be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties. The date on which Closing Date Net Working Capital,
Closing Date Indebtedness, and Closing Date Cash are finally determined in
accordance with this  _Section 3.5(b)_ is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Determination Date_." All fees and expenses of the Auditor relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Auditor hereunder shall be borne between
Parent, on the one hand, and the Holder Representative, as a Holder Allocable
Expense, on the other, based on the percentage which the portion of the total
contested amounts not awarded to such Party as determined by the Auditor bears
to the total amounts contested by the Parties.

(c) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then the Aggregate
Consideration shall be increased by the Adjustment Amount and the Adjustment
Amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section 3.5(d)_. If the Adjustment
Amount is a negative number, then the Aggregate Consideration shall be
decreased by the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount and the Adjustment
Amount shall be paid in accordance with _Section 3.5(e)_.

(d) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then (i) Parent shall
deliver (or cause to be delivered) within three (3) Business Days following
the Determination Date (x) to the Exchange Agent (for distribution to each
Company Stockholder in accordance with such Company Stockholders Common Pro
Rata Percentage) a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (A) the
Adjustment Amount, _multiplied by_ (B) the Aggregate Common Pro Rata
Percentage, and (y) to the Surviving Corporation (for payment to each Company
Optionholder in accordance with such Company Optionholders Option Pro Rata
Percentage) a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (A) the
Adjustment Amount, _multiplied by_ (B) the Aggregate Option Pro Rata
Percentage, and (ii) the Holder Representative (on behalf of the Company
Equityholders) and Parent shall each, within three (3) Business Days after the
Determination Date, direct the Escrow Agent to release (x) to the Exchange
Agent (for distribution to each Company Stockholder in accordance with such
Company Stockholders Common Pro Rata Percentage) a cash payment in an amount
equal to the product of (A) the total amount of the funds in the
Adjustment Escrow Account, _multiplied by_ (B) the Aggregate Common Pro Rata
Percentage, and (y) to the Surviving Corporation (for payment to each Company
Optionholder in accordance with such Company Optionholders Option Pro
Rata Percentage) a cash payment in an amount equal to the product of (A) the
total amount of the funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account, _multiplied by_
(B) the Aggregate Option Pro Rata Percentage.

 

(e) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Holder Representative
(on behalf of the Company Equityholders) and Parent shall each, within three
(3) Business Days after the Determination Date, direct the Escrow Agent to (i)
pay to Parent from the Adjustment Escrow Account an aggregate amount equal to
the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount and (ii) release (x) to the
Exchange Agent (for distribution to each Company Stockholder in accordance
with such Company Stockholders Common Pro Rata Percentage) a cash payment in
an amount equal to the product of (A) the total amount of any remaining funds
(if any) in the Adjustment Escrow Account after giving effect to the payments
pursuant to the preceding clause (i), _multiplied by_ (B) the Aggregate Common
Pro Rata Percentage, and (y) to the 

 



22  Surviving Corporation (for payment to each Company Optionholder in
accordance with such Company Optionholders Option Pro Rata Percentage) a cash
payment in an amount equal to the product of (A) the total amount of any
remaining funds (if any) in the Adjustment Escrow Account after giving effect
to the payments pursuant to the preceding clause (i), _multiplied by_ (B) the
Aggregate Option Pro Rata Percentage. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if the amount payable to Parent pursuant to this
_Section 3.5(e)_ exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount, then such excess shall
be paid out of the Indemnification Escrow Amount. 

(f) Any amount that is paid pursuant to this _Section 3.5_ shall be treated
by the Parties for Tax purposes as an adjustment of the Aggregate
Consideration.

3.6 _Escrow of Consideration_.

 

(a) On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
$75,000,000 (the " _Indemnification Escrow Amount_ ") into an escrow account
(the " _Indemnification Escrow Account_ ") established pursuant to the terms
of an Escrow Agreement to be entered into at Closing among Holder
Representative, Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as escrow
agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit E_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), in order to fully support the
Company Equityholders indemnification obligations under _Article XII_
hereof.

(b) On the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, $10,000,000 (the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") into an escrow
account (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ ") established pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, in order to support the Company Equityholders
payment obligations under _Section 3.5(e)_.

(c) Each Company Equityholder shall be deemed to have contributed an amount
to each Escrow Account equal to such Company Equityholders Pro Rata
Percentage of each of the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, as applicable.

 

3.7 _Qualified Letters of Credit_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
Company Stockholder shall have the right after the Closing to cause the
Escrow Agent to distribute to such Company Stockholder an amount equal to the
product of such Company Stockholders Common Pro Rata Percentage _multiplied
by_ the Indemnification Escrow Amount so long as (i) the amount of such
distributed funds to such Company Stockholder is greater than $500,000, and
(ii) such Company Stockholder delivers a Qualified Letter of Credit with a
principal amount equal to the amount of such distributed funds to the Escrow
Agent (each such Company Stockholder that delivers a Qualified Letter of
Credit being referred to herein as a " _Credit Holder_ "). At any time the
Escrow Agent is required to distribute any of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount to any Person other than the Company Equityholders (including other
than to the Surviving Corporation on behalf of the Company Optionholders as
provided herein), the Escrow Agent shall draw funds from each Qualified Letter
of Credit based upon each Credit Holders Common Pro Rata Percentage, and the
Escrow Agent shall distribute such drawn amount from each Qualified Letter of
Credit together with the other requisite funds from the

 



23  Indemnification Escrow Amount to satisfy the distribution requirement.
Company Stockholders shall not be permitted to substitute a Qualified Letter
of Credit for the Adjustment Escrow Amount. 

(b) The amount of funds that the Escrow Agent shall be permitted to draw in
respect of each Qualified Letter of Credit shall be reduced from time to time
as follows:

(i) if the Escrow Agent draws funds from a Qualified Letter of Credit, then
the amount of funds that the Escrow Agent is thereafter permitted to draw in
respect of such Qualified Letter of Credit shall be reduced by that amount
drawn; and

 

(ii) if the Escrow Agent distributes any portion of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount to the Company Equityholders in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement (including distributions to the Surviving Corporation on
behalf of the Company Optionholders as provided herein), no Credit Holder
shall receive such distribution in the form of cash, and instead such
distribution shall be paid to each Credit Holder by reducing the amount of
funds that the Escrow Agent is permitted to draw in respect of such Credit
Holders Qualified Letter of Credit by an amount equal to the product of (x)
the portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount being distributed,
_multiplied by_ (y) such Credit Holders Common Pro Rata Percentage.

Upon any reduction in the amount of funds from a Qualified Letter of Credit
that the Escrow Agent is permitted to draw, each Credit Holder shall be
permitted (but not required) to amend the Qualified Letter of Credit it
delivered, or to terminate its Qualified Letter of Credit in connection with
the simultaneous delivery of a replacement Qualified Letter of Credit, in
order to reduce the available credit pursuant to such Qualified Letter of
Credit so that the available credit pursuant to the Qualified Letter of
Credit is equal to the remaining amount of the funds that the Escrow Agent is
permitted to draw from such Qualified Letter of Credit; _provided_ , that a
Credit Holders decision on whether or not to amend or replace its Qualified
Letter of Credit shall have no effect on the reductions in the amount that the
Escrow Agent is permitted to draw in respect of such Qualified Letter of
Credit; _provided_ , _further_ , that any such replacement Qualified Letter
of Credit must be in substantially the same form as the Qualified Letter of
Credit it is replacing except for the permitted reductions in the available
credit described above. Once the amount of funds the Escrow Agent is permitted
to draw from a Qualified Letter of Credit is equal to zero, the Credit Holder
shall be permitted to terminate such Qualified Letter of Credit.

(c) If any Qualified Letter of Credit (including any replacement Qualified
Letter of Credit) is set to terminate in accordance with its terms on a date
prior to when all of the Indemnification Escrow Amount is distributed in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, and the applicable Credit Holder does
not deliver a replacement Qualified Letter of Credit effective as of a date on
or before such termination date and on substantially the same terms as such
terminating Qualified Letter of Credit (including with sufficient credit to
satisfy the remaining funding obligations of such Qualified Letter of Credit
that are contemplated herein) but with a later termination date, then on the
date two (2) Business Days prior to the expiration date, the Escrow Agent
shall draw the maximum amount of funds from such expiring Qualified Letter of
Credit that the Escrow Agent is then-permitted to draw (taking into account
any reductions of the amount of funds the Escrow Agent is permitted to draw
pursuant to _Section 3.7(b)_), and such

 



24  drawn amount shall be added to the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the
applicable Credit Holder shall be treated in the same manner as the other
Company Stockholders (including with respect to the right to receive
distributions in the form of cash for all distributions from the
Indemnification Escrow Amount).

(d) All references in this Agreement (including _Section 12.4_) to the
Indemnification Escrow Amount shall include both funds that are part of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount (less any interest accrued on the
Indemnification Escrow Amount that has not yet been distributed pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement) and the amounts which the Escrow Agent shall be
permitted to draw from Qualified Letters of Credit (taking into account any
reductions of the amount of funds the Escrow Agent is permitted to
draw pursuant to _Section 3.7(b)_), at the applicable time. All references
in this Agreement to distributions, releases and other similar terms with
respect to the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall include both (i) payments
of cash from the Indemnification Escrow Account and (ii) any reductions of
the amount of funds the Escrow Agent is permitted to draw pursuant to _Section
3.7(b)_. For purposes of this _Section 3.7_, distributions of any of
the Indemnification Escrow Amount to the Holder Representative to advance or
reimburse expenses of the Holder Representative, acting in its capacity as
such, shall not be deemed to be a distribution to a Company Equityholder.

 

3.8 _Outstanding Company Expenses_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall provide to Parent a written report setting forth a list of the
following fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the
preparation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, solely to the extent such fees
and expenses are unpaid as of the close of business on the Closing Date: (a)
the fees and disbursements of outside counsel to the Company incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) the fees and
expenses of any other agents, advisors, consultants and experts employed by
the Company in connection with the Merger, (c) any Change in Control Payments,
(d) the amount to be paid to the Holder Representative and used for payment of
expenses incurred in its capacity as the Holder Representative (such amount,
the " _Holder Allocable Expenses_ "), and (e) the aggregate amount of any
Transfer Taxes that are the responsibility of the Company Equityholders
pursuant to  _Section 8.2(a)_ (clauses (a)-(e) collectively, the "
_Outstanding Company Expenses_ "). Immediately prior to the Effective Time and
concurrently with the payment to the Exchange Agent of the Funding Amount,
Parent shall pay to such third parties as are directed by the Company, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the
Outstanding Company Expenses. No amount shall be included on the Closing
Balance Sheet with respect to liabilities for the Outstanding Company
Expenses paid in accordance with this _Section 3.8_. For the avoidance of
doubt, no amounts payable in connection with the repayment of the Funded Debt
or any amounts payable in connection with assisting Parent with the Financing
shall be included in the Outstanding Company Expenses.

3.9 _Repayment of Funded Debt_. At the Closing, and subject to the other
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, (a) Parent or Merger Sub
shall make available to the Company, or pay directly, an amount in cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate outstanding Funded Debt, (b) the Company, if
such amount is not paid directly by Parent or Merger Sub, shall apply such
cash to repay the Funded Debt, and (c) the Company shall cause the applicable
agent under the Credit Agreement to deliver to Parent (i) a pay-off letter, in
form

 



25  and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, evidencing the satisfaction
of all liabilities under the Credit Agreement (other than any indemnity
obligation for unasserted claims that by its terms survives the termination
of the Credit Agreement) upon receipt of the amounts set forth in such pay-off
letter and (ii) a release in customary form concurrently with the payment of
amounts specified in the pay-off letter referred to in clause (i) above of
all Liens with respect to the capital stock, property and assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the Credit Agreement.

 

3.10 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any Tax laws. If Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation so withholds (or causes to be withheld) any such
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding is made. To the extent that Parent becomes aware of any
withholding Taxes applicable to the payment of the Common Merger
Consideration, Parent shall provide prompt written notice to the Company and
the Holder Representative of the amount of such Tax; provided that the
Parties acknowledge and agree that payment of Option Consideration pursuant
to _Section 3.2(d)_ or any other payments that are compensatory in nature
will be subject to withholding Taxes and no Party is obligated to seek
exemption from, or reduction of, such Taxes.

under, any of such Insurance Policies. All premiums due on such Insurance
Policies have either been paid or, if due and payable prior to Closing, will
be paid prior to Closing in accordance with the payment terms of each
Insurance Policy. The Insurance Policies do not provide for any retrospective

(iii) cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent, including using

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide,
or cause its Subsidiaries to provide, cooperation under this _Section 6.4_
that: (A) unreasonably interferes with the ongoing business of the Company or
any of the Companys Subsidiaries; (B) causes any representation or warranty

obtained by the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries using commercially
reasonable efforts or for the failure to obtain review of any financial or
other information by its accountants. In no event shall the Company or any

any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees or representatives) or expense in connection with assisting Parent
in arranging the Financing or as a result of any information provided by
the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective

connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
condition precedent set forth in _Section 9.2(b)_, as applied to the

breach of the obligations under this section.

protection) relating to any event, transaction or circumstance, as soon as
practicable after it becomes known to the Company, occurring on or after the
date of this Agreement (except for changes or developments permitted or
contemplated by this Agreement) that renders, or shall render, untrue or
causes, or shall cause, the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement of the Company under this Agreement as if the same were made on
or as of the date of such event, transaction or circumstance;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure of the Company to comply with this _Section 6.6_
shall not subject the Company to any liability hereunder for covenant breach
as a result of a failure to provide notice hereunder with respect to any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

(b) Until the date falling ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall have the right (but not the obligation) from time to time to
supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedules with a list of any other
matters first arising after the date hereof; _provided_ that such
other matters (x) shall not be deemed to have cured any breach of
representation or warranty made in this Agreement for purposes of determining
whether or not the conditions set forth in _Article IX_ have been satisfied or
whether or not Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)(i)_, and (y) to the extent any such supplement
or amendment is accepted by Parent, such other matters shall be deemed to cure

amendment in writing within five Business Days of its receipt of such
supplement or amendment.

cause the Management Agreement and the Stockholders Agreements to terminate

initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to, any Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or
(iii) enter into any agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding)

their Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all

inquiry, and the identity of the Person making the same.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein to the contrary, the
Company agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
_Section 6.8_ shall include having such provision specifically enforced by
any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that

reasonable efforts to prepare the consolidated balance sheet, income
statement, statement of cash flows and statement of shareholders

(a) In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
shall (and, to the extent required, shall cause its Affiliates to) file, or
cause to be filed, a premerger notification and report form pursuant to the
HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within
five (5) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, including a request
for early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to comply at the earliest practicable
date with any formal or informal request for additional information or
documentary material and shall cooperate in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement commenced by any Regulatory Consent Authority.

 

(b) Parent shall, as promptly as possible, use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, or cause to be obtained, all consents, authorizations, orders and
approvals from all Regulatory Consent Authorities that may be or become
necessary for its execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance
of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Parent shall cooperate fully
with the Company in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents,
authorizations, orders and approvals. Neither Parent nor its Affiliates shall
willfully take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or
impeding the receipt of any required consents, authorizations, orders and
approvals.

(c) Parent shall promptly notify the Company and the Holder Representative of
written or, if not written, material, communication made to or received by
Parent from any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent shall permit counsel to the Company
an opportunity to review in advance, and Parent shall consider in good faith
the views of such counsel in connection with, any proposed written
communications by Parent and its Affiliates to any Governmental Authority
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent agrees to
provide the Company, the Holder Representative and their counsel the
opportunity, on reasonable advance notice, to participate in any substantive
meetings or discussions, either in person or by telephone, between Parent or
any of its Affiliates, agents or advisors, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority, on the other hand, concerning or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to applicable Law, the Parent
will consult with the Company and cooperate with the Company in

 



52  connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, and proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Authority
regarding the transactions described herein by or on behalf of any Party.

(d) Parent shall be responsible for and pay one-half of all filing fees
payable to the Regulatory Consent Authorities in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.2 _Indemnification and Insurance Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date, Parent agrees that it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to indemnify and
hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines or Losses incurred in
connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would have been permitted under
applicable Law and its respective certificate of formation, limited liability
company agreement or other organizational documents in effect on the date of
this Agreement to indemnify such Person (including the advancing of expenses
as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, subject
to Parents receipt of an undertaking by such Person to repay such advances
if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification). Without limiting the foregoing, (i) Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries (x) to maintain for a
period of not less than six years from the Effective Time provisions in its
Governing Documents concerning the indemnification (including provisions
relating to expense advancement) of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
former and current officers, directors, employees, and agents that are no less
favorable to those Persons than the provisions of the Governing Documents of
the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case, as of the date
of this Agreement and (y) for a period of not less than six years from the
Closing Date, not to amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in any
respect that would adversely affect the rights of those Persons thereunder,
in each case, except as required by Law and (ii) Parent agrees that any
indemnification and advancement of expenses available to any current or former
director of the Company or its Subsidiaries by virtue of such current or
former directors service as a partner or employee of any investment fund
that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to the Closing (any such current or
former director, a " _Sponsor Director_ ") shall be secondary to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses to be provided by the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ and that the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (A) shall be the primary
indemnitors of first resort for Sponsor Directors pursuant to this _Section
7.2_, (B) shall be fully responsible for the advancement of all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses and the payment of all Losses with respect to Sponsor
Directors which are addressed by this _Section 7.2_ and (C) shall not make
any claim for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in
respect of any other indemnification available to any Sponsor Director with
respect to any matter addressed by this  _Section 7.2_. Parent shall assume,
and be jointly and severally liable for, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, each of the covenants in this
_Section 7.2_.

 



53 (b) For a period of six years from the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect directors and officers
liability insurance covering those Persons who are currently covered by the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries directors and officers liability
insurance policies (true, correct and complete copies of which have been
heretofore made available to Parent or its agents or representatives) on terms
not materially less favorable than the terms of such current insurance
coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in lieu of maintaining such
coverage, Parent or the Surviving Corporation may obtain a six-year "tail"
policy containing terms not materially less favorable than the terms of such
current insurance coverage with respect to claims existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) if any claim is asserted or made within
such six-year period, any insurance maintained under this _Section 7.2_ shall
be continued in respect of such claim until the final disposition thereof,
unless such coverage is cancelled or otherwise limited due to conduct of an
insured Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such
insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). The
Maximum Premium is set forth on _Schedule 7.2(b)_. If such insurance coverage
cannot be obtained at an annual premium equal to or less than the Maximum
Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain, that amount of directors and
officers insurance (or "tail" coverage) obtainable for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Premium.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this _Section 7.2_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation.
In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to
the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.2_.

7.3 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and thereafter, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, comply with the terms of
the employment, severance, termination, consulting, retirement and other
compensation and benefit plans, arrangements and agreements to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party set forth on _Schedule 4.16(a)_
; provided that such compliance will not result in a duplication of
compensation or benefits; and provided, further, that the foregoing shall not
limit the Surviving Corporations ability to amend or terminate such plans,
arrangements and agreements to the extent permitted by their terms and
otherwise in compliance with Section 7.3(b).

(b) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December 31,
2015, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who continues in the employ
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates
following the Closing Date (" _Continuing Employees_ ") with: (i) annual base
salary and cash incentive compensation opportunities that are

 



54  no less than the annual base salary and cash incentive compensation
opportunities, respectively, provided to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity
compensation) that are not less favorable to such Continuing Employee than the
more favorable to such Continuing Employee of (A) those benefits provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (B) those
benefits that Parent or its Affiliates provide to their similarly-situated
employees during such period.

 

(c) From and after the Closing, Parent (i) shall give each Continuing Employee
full credit for all purposes, including eligibility to participate, level of
benefits, vesting and benefit accrual, under any applicable employee benefit
plans, arrangements, collective agreements and employment-related entitlements
(including severance and vacation/paid time off policies (and any accruals
thereunder)) provided, sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or
any of its Affiliates for such Continuing Employees service with the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and with any predecessor employer, to the same
extent recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except to the
extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits for the same
period of service, and (ii) shall credit to each Continuing Employee under the
applicable vacation or paid time off program of the Parent or its Affiliates
all unused vacation or other paid time off days of such Continuing Employee
that accrued on or prior to the Closing Date, and shall not take any actions
that adversely affect any such Continuing Employees (or their future accrual
of vacation or paid time off) as a result of such credit; provided that the
Continuing Employees use of unused vacation or paid time off on and after the
Closing Date shall be subject to any limitations set forth in applicable
program of Parent or its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent permitted under applicable Law, Parent shall not be required to provide
credit for such service for benefit accrual purposes under any employee
benefit plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates that is a defined benefit
pension plan.

(d) Parent shall (i) waive or cause to be waived for each Continuing Employee
and his or her dependents, any waiting period provision, payment requirement
to avoid a waiting period, pre-existing condition limitation, actively-at-work
requirement and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full
participation under the welfare plans of Parent or any of its Affiliates
applicable to such Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-
existing condition limitation, actively-at-work requirement or other
restriction would not have been applicable to (or was previously satisfied by)
such Continuing Employee under the terms of the comparable welfare plan of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) give or cause to be given full credit
under the welfare plans of Parent and its Affiliates applicable to each
Continuing Employee and his or her dependents for all co-payments and
deductibles satisfied prior to the Closing in the same plan year as the
Closing, and for any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a single
continuous employer.

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain from each Person (listed on _Schedule 7.3(e)_) who is a
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
with respect to Company and to whom any payment or benefit is required or
proposed to be paid or provided that would constitute a "parachute payment"
(as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) a written agreement waiving
such Persons right to receive some or all of such payment or benefit (the "
_Waived Benefit_ ") so that all remaining portions of such payments or
benefits applicable to such Person shall not be deemed to be a parachute
payment that would not be deductible under Section 280G 

 



55  of the Code, and accepting in substitution for the Waived Benefit the right
to receive payments equal to the Waived Benefit only if approved by the
holders of Company Voting Common Stock in a manner that complies with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code. Each such waiver shall identify the specific Waived
Benefit and shall provide that if such approval of the holders of Company
Voting Common Stock is not obtained in a manner that complies with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, such Waived Benefit shall not be paid or provided
and such Person shall have no right or entitlement with respect thereto. As
soon as practicable after execution of such waivers but in any event prior to
the Closing, the Company shall seek the approval of the holders of Company
Voting Common Stock in a manner that complies with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of
the Code for the Waived Benefit that has been conditioned on the receipt of
such stockholder approval. The determination of which payments or benefits
may be deemed to constitute parachute payments, the form of each such waiver,
the disclosure documents (and related calculations) and other circumstances of
any such stockholder approval shall be provided to Parent for Parents
advance review.

(f) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_Section 7.3_ are included for the sole benefit of the Parties. This
Agreement is not intended by the Parties to, and nothing in this _Section
7.3_ or otherwise in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall, (i)
constitute an amendment to any Benefit Plan, (ii) obligate Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates to maintain any particular
compensation or benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement, (iii)
create any obligation of the Parties with respect to any employee benefit
plan of Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates (including
the Benefits Plans), or (iv) confer on any Continuing Employee or any other
Person (other than the Parties) any rights or remedies (including third-party
beneficiary rights).

7.4 _Notice of Certain Events_. Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing of, and contemporaneously shall provide the Company with true and
complete copies of, any and all information or documents in Parents
possession (to the extent permitted to do so under applicable Law and
Contract, and without prejudicing attorney-client or similar privilege or
attorney work product protection) relating to any event, transaction or
circumstance, as soon as practicable after it becomes known to Parent,
occurring on or after the date of this Agreement (except for changes or
developments permitted or contemplated by this Agreement) that renders, or
shall render, untrue or causes, or shall cause, the breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or Merger Sub under
this Agreement as if the same were made on or as of the date of such event,
transaction or circumstance; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of
Parent to comply with this _Section 7.4_ shall not subject Parent or
Merger Sub to any liability hereunder for covenant breach as a result of a
failure to provide notice hereunder with respect to any representation or
warranty.

 

7.5 _Post-Closing Access; Preservation of Records_. From and after the
Closing, Parent will make or cause to be made available to the Holder
Representative and its agents, representatives and advisors all books, records
and documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and the reasonable
assistance of employees responsible for such books, records and documents)
during regular business hours as may be reasonably necessary for (a)
investigating, settling, preparing for the defense or prosecution of or
defending or prosecuting any Action, (b) preparing reports to equityholders
and Governmental Authorities or (c) insurance, Tax or accounting matters,
including preparing and delivering any accounting or other statement

 



56  provided for under this Agreement or otherwise; provided, however, that
access to such books, records, documents and employees will not unreasonably
interfere with the normal operations of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries or violate applicable Law and Contract and the reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries incurred in
connection therewith will be paid by the Holder Representative. Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to maintain and preserve
all such books, records and documents for the greater of (i) five (5) years
after the Closing Date or (ii) any applicable statutory or regulatory
retention period, as the same may be extended.

ARTICLE VIII.

 

JOINT COVENANTS

8.1  _Support of Transaction_. Without limiting any covenant contained in
_Article VI_ or _Article VII_ , including the obligations of Parent with
respect to the notifications, filings, reaffirmations and applications as
described in  _Section 7.1_, which obligations shall control to the extent
of any conflict with the succeeding provisions of this _Section 8.1_, Parent
and the Company shall each, and shall each cause their respective Subsidiaries
to: (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to assemble, prepare and file any
information (and, as needed, to supplement such information) as may be
reasonably necessary to obtain as promptly as practicable all governmental and
regulatory consents required to be obtained in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all material consents and approvals of third parties that any of
Parent, the Company, or their respective Affiliates are required to obtain in
order to consummate the Merger, and (c) take such other action as may
reasonably be necessary or as another party may reasonably request to satisfy
the conditions of _Article IX_ or otherwise to comply with this Agreement and
to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby as soon as practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Company, Parent or any of
their respective Subsidiaries be obligated to bear any third party expense or
pay any fee or grant any concession in connection with obtaining any consents,
authorizations or approvals pursuant to the terms of any Contract to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with
the consummation of the Merger.

8.2 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. One half of all stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in
connection with the Merger shall be the responsibility of each of Parent and
the Company Equityholders, and Parent and the Holder Representative shall
reasonably cooperate in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes.

(b)  _Tax Claims_.

(i) Parent shall notify Holder Representative promptly in writing of any
audit, examination or other claim relating to Taxes of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that may give rise to a claim for indemnification under
_Section 12.2(a)_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to give such prompt notice shall not affect any rights or obligations
of the Company Equityholders, except to the extent the Company Equityholders
have actually been prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 



57 (ii) The Holder Representative shall have the exclusive right to control any
and all Tax Claims that relate solely to Tax periods that end on or before
the Closing Date and may make all decisions taken in connection with such Tax
Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Holder Representative shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status of such Tax Claim, (B) Parent may at
its own expense participate in the proceedings related to such Tax Claim, and
(C) the Holder Representative shall not settle, resolve or close any such Tax
Claim in a manner that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
amount or timing of Taxes (or Tax reporting compliance required under
applicable Law) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries in a Post-
Closing Tax Period without the written consent of Parent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Holder
Representative and Parent, at its expense, shall jointly control all
proceedings with respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period.
If the Holder Representative fails to notify Parent of the Holder
Representatives intent to assume the defense of any Tax Claim that the Holder
Representative is entitled to control and defend pursuant to this _Section
8.2(b)(ii)_ within fifteen (15) days of receipt of notice thereof, Parent, at
its own expense, shall control the defense and settlement of such Tax Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (x) Parent shall keep the Holder Representative
reasonably informed of the status of such Tax Claim, and (y) Parent shall not
settle, resolve or close any such Tax Claim in a manner adverse to the Company
Equityholders without the written consent of the Holder Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(c) _Tax Returns_. Parent, at its own expense, shall prepare, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to prepare, in a manner consistent with past practices
(except as required by applicable Law), and timely file, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to timely file, all Tax Returns of the Surviving
Corporation (or the Company) and its Subsidiaries that are filed after the
Closing Date. Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered each such Tax
Return described in the preceding sentence that is for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Straddle Period) to the
Holder Representative for its review and comment at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date (as may be extended) for filing such Tax Return,
provided that Holder Representative comments shall be made only to the extent
the Taxes shown on such Tax Return could give rise to indemnification under
Article XII or the Company Equityholders could be entitled to any Tax refunds
attributable to such Tax Return. If the Holder Representative disputes any
item on any of such Tax Return, the Holder Representative shall notify the
Parent of such disputed item (or items) and the basis for its objection within
fifteen (15) days of the Holder Representatives receipt of such Tax Return.
The Parent and the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Holder
Representative, on the other hand, shall attempt in good faith mutually to
resolve any disagreement regarding such Tax Return prior to the due date of
filing thereof (taking into account any available extensions). If the Parties
are unable to resolve such dispute within a five (5) day period, the Parties
shall retain the services of the Auditor to resolve such disputes, and the
Auditors determination with respect to each disputed matter shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties. Upon resolution of all such disputes in
accordance with this _Section 8.2(c)_, such Tax Return shall be timely filed
on that basis, provided, however, that if the parties have not resolved all
matters in dispute pursuant to

 



58  the procedures set forth in this _Section 8.2(c)_ before such Tax Return is
due (taking into account available extensions), such Tax Return may be filed
as prepared by Parent and the Surviving Corporation, subject to adjustment or
amendment upon resolution of the disputed matters with respect to such Tax
Return, and the Parties shall make any and all payments to the other as
required under this Agreement necessary to give effect to the resolution. The
cost of the Auditor shall be borne one-half by the Parent and one-half by the
Holder Representative. Parent shall not file or cause to be filed any Tax
Return subject to this _Section 8.2(c)_ without the prior written consent of
the Holder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned. For purposes of this _Section 8.2(c)_, the Parties
shall treat the taxable year of the Company and/or any of its applicable
Subsidiaries as ending as of the end of the Closing Date as required by
Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) and allowable under
other applicable Law, and income Tax items (including the distributive share
of partnership items required to be determined pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(vi)(A)) shall be allocated to the period
ending on the Closing Date in accordance with such applicable Law based on an
interim closing of the books as of the end of the day on the Closing Date.

(d) _Straddle Period Taxes_. For purposes of this Agreement, including 
_Article XII_ , in the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a
Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be deemed equal to (A) in the case of real or
personal property Taxes or other similar Taxes imposed on an _ad valorem_
basis, the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in such Straddle Period, (B) in the case of any Taxes based upon or measured
by capital (including net worth or long-term debt) or intangibles, a
proportionate amount of such Taxes computed by reference to the level of such
items on the Closing Date and the timing of the Closing Date in relation to
the relevant Straddle Period, (C) in the case of Income Taxes (however
denominated) or other Taxes, the amount of such Taxes that would be payable
based on an interim closing of the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of the end of the Closing Date; _provided_ , that, exemptions, allowances
or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (such as
depreciation) shall be apportioned on a pro rata basis.

(e) _Tax Refunds_. Except to the extent taken in to account in determining
Closing Date Net Working Capital (as finally determined in accordance with
_Section 3.5(b))_ and for so long as the Company Equityholders have any
obligation to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section
12.2(a)_, any Tax refund (including any interest received in respect thereof)
received or applied for by any of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be for the account of the Company Equityholders to the
extent such Tax refund (i) results from the application of any Transaction
Tax Deductions, (ii) is a refund of non-Income Taxes, or (iii) is a refund of
Income Taxes not attributable to Transaction Tax Deductions or Compensation
Costs. Except as otherwise requested by the Holder Representative, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates, as applicable, shall elect to
receive any such Tax refund as a cash payment and not as an offset to any
liability for Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, all other Tax refunds shall
be for the account of the Parent. In determining the Tax refunds attributable
to Tax deductions in this _Section 8.2(e)_, Tax refunds shall be treated as
attributable to Compensation Costs first, Transaction Tax Deductions second,
and any other Tax deductions third. Parent shall pay to the Holder
Representative (for distribution to the Company Equityholders in the same
manner as set forth in the last sentence of _Section 11.2_ with respect to 

 



59  Holder Allocable Expenses) any such refund that the Company Equityholders
are entitled to pursuant to this _Section 8.2(e)_ within fifteen (15) days
after the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries receipt or
entitlement thereto, net of any expenses incurred by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in seeking or securing such refund;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such refunds shall not include any refunds or
amounts attributable to the carryback of any credit, net operating loss,
capital loss deduction or other similar Tax attribute arising in a Post-
Closing Tax Period beginning after the Closing Date. With respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, upon the Holder Representatives reasonable request,
Parent shall, or shall cause its relevant Affiliate to, initiate a claim for a
refund of Taxes that relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries; and provided further, that Holder Representative
shall advance to Parent all out-of-pocket costs to be incurred in connection
with making the claim for refund. Any such refund claim (including any amended
Tax Return) shall be subject to the review, comment and filing procedures set
forth in _Section 8.2(c)_.

(f) _Cooperation_. After the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the
Holder Representative, on the other hand, shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other, in connection with the preparation
and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_ and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes (including any Tax
Claim). Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the others
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to execute Tax
Returns and to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) retain all books and records with respect
to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (taking into account any extensions
thereof), (ii) allow the Holder Representative and its representatives at
times and dates mutually acceptable to the Parties, to inspect, review and
make copies of such records as such party may deem necessary or appropriate
from time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal business
hours at such partys expense, and (iii) give the Holder Representative
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the Holder Representative so requests,
shall allow the Holder Representative to take possession of such books and
records.

(g) Parent shall not, and shall not cause or permit any of its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to, (i) file an
amended Tax Return, or agree to any waiver or extension of the statute of
limitations, relating to Taxes with respect to the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) take any action on the
Closing Date other than in the ordinary course of business, which action could
increase the amount of Losses subject to indemnification under _Section
12.2(a)_ or reduce the Common Merger Consideration, (iii) make any election
under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the Merger or (iv) waive the
carryback of any net operating losses arising in any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
in each case, without the prior written consent of the Holder Representative,
provided that solely in the case of clause (i) of this _Section 8.2(g)_, such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned.

 



60 In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this _Section 8.2_ and
any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section 8.2_ shall control.

8.3 _Further Assurances_. Each Party agrees that from time to time after the
Closing Date, it will execute and deliver, or cause its respective Affiliates
to execute and deliver, such further instruments, and take, or cause their
respective Affiliates to take, such other actions, as may be reasonably
necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents.

ARTICLE XI.

HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

11.1 _Designation and Replacement of Holder Representative_. The Parties have
agreed that it is desirable to designate a representative to act on behalf of
the Company Equityholders for certain limited purposes, as specified herein
(the " _Holder Representative_ "). The Parties have designated Leonard Green and
Partners, L.P. as the initial Holder Representative, and approval of this
Agreement by the Company Equityholders shall constitute ratification and
approval of such designation. The Holder Representative may resign at any
time, and the Holder Representative may be removed by the vote of the Company
Equityholders which collectively hold at such time (or following the Closing,
held immediately prior to the Effective Time) a Pro Rata Percentage of more
than fifty percent (50%) (the " _Majority Equityholders_ "). In the event
that a Holder Representative has resigned or been removed, a new Holder
Representative shall be appointed by a vote of the Majority Equityholders,
such appointment to become effective upon the written acceptance thereof by
the new Holder Representative and the written consent of Parent (such consent
not to be unreasonable withheld or delayed).

 



64 11.2 _Authority and Rights of the Holder Representative; Limitations on
Liability_. The Holder Representative shall have such powers and authority as
are necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Holder Representative shall have no
obligation to act on behalf of the Company Equityholders, except as expressly
provided herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Holder
Representative shall have full power, authority and discretion to, (a) expend
Holder Allocable Expenses, (b) after the Closing, negotiate and enter into
amendments to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement for and on behalf of the
Company Equityholders, (c) exercise on behalf of the Company Equityholders all
rights granted to the Holder Representative under _Sections 3.5_ and _8.2_ ,
and (d) with respect to any Indemnification Claim made pursuant to _Section
12.2(a)_, exercise all rights granted to the Indemnitor under _Article XII_
(subject to paragraph (d) of _Section 12.3_). The Holder Representative
shall have no liability to Parent, the Company (and, following the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation) or any Company Equityholder with respect to
actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Holder
Representative (except to Company Equityholders for those actions arising out
of the Holder Representatives bad faith or willful misconduct). The Holder
Representative shall at all times be entitled to rely on any directions
received from the Majority Equityholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Holder Representative shall not be required to follow any such direction, and
shall be under no obligation to take any action in its capacity as the Holder
Representative, unless the Holder Representative is holding funds delivered to
it under _Section 3.8_ of this Agreement and/or has been provided with other
funds, security or indemnities which, in the sole determination of the Holder
Representative, are sufficient to protect the Holder Representative against
the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Holder
Representative in responding to such direction or taking such action. The
Holder Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and
other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in connection with
exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder and (in the
absence of bad faith on the part of the Holder Representative) shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The
Holder Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement from funds paid to it
under _Section 3.8_ of this Agreement, released from the Escrow Accounts for
the benefit of the Company Equityholders and/or otherwise received by it in
its capacity as the Holder Representative pursuant to or in connection with
this Agreement, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances
(including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants) incurred by the Holder Representative in such capacity, and shall
be entitled to indemnification (i) first, from funds paid to it under 
_Section 3.8_ of this Agreement, and (ii) second, from the Company
Equityholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages,
against any loss, liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or
omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Holder Representative (except for
those arising out of the Holder Representatives bad faith or willful
misconduct), including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of
claims. In the event that the Holder Allocable Expenses exceed the amount
actually incurred by the Holder Representative in its capacity as such upon
the final release of funds from the Escrow Accounts in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Holder Representative shall deliver (x) to
the Exchange Agent (for distribution to each Company Stockholder in accordance
with such Company Stockholders Common Pro Rata Percentage) a cash payment in
an amount equal to the product of (A) such excess amount, _multiplied by_ (B)
the Aggregate Common Pro Rata Percentage, and (y) to the Surviving Corporation
(for payment to each Company Optionholder in accordance with such Company
Optionholders Option Pro Rata Percentage) a cash payment in an amount equal
to the product of (A) such excess amount, _multiplied by_ (B) the Aggregate
Option Pro Rata Percentage.

 



65 ARTICLE XII.

 

INDEMNIFICATION

12.1  _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. Each
representation warranty, covenant and obligation contained herein and any
certificate related to any such representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation will survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect for
18 months from the Closing Date (such date, the " _Survival Expiration Date_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that any covenant contained in this Agreement
that, by its terms, provides for performance following the Closing Date shall
survive until such covenant is performed. For the avoidance of doubt, subject
to following sentence, the Parent Indemnified Parties right to
indemnification under  _Section 12.2(a)(iii)_ shall survive until the
Survival Expiration Date. No Indemnification Claim may be asserted pursuant to
this Agreement unless on or before the Survival Expiration Date, such claim is
asserted by proper written notice in accordance with this _Article XII_,
specifying, in reasonable detail, the basis of the claim.

12.2 _Indemnification_. 

(a) Subject to _Section 12.4_, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and
its Affiliates, including following the Effective Time the Company and its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ "), shall be
entitled to indemnification for any and all Losses (including reasonable costs
and expenses of the Parent Indemnified Parties incurred in connection with
making such claim under this Agreement) to the extent arising from (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty of the Company in this Agreement or
in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, (ii) any breach of any covenant
or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement requiring performance
by the Company prior to or at the Closing, or (iii) any Taxes of or with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, except to the extent such Taxes are Transfer Taxes for which Parent is
responsible pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ or were taken into account in
calculating Closing Date Net Working Capital or Indebtedness (as finally
determined in accordance with _Section 3.5(b))_.

(b) Subject to _Section 12.4_, from and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall indemnify, defend and hold the Company Equityholders harmless for any
and all Losses (including reasonable costs and expenses of the Company
Equityholders incurred in connection with making such claim under this
Agreement) to the extent arising from (i) any breach of any representation or
warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto or (ii) any breach of any covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement requiring performance by Parent or
Merger Sub prior to or at the Closing or by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation after the Closing.

 

(c) The amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be
entitled under this _Article XII_ shall be determined: (i) by the written
agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any
other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree.
The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for
appeal, if any,

 



66  shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals
taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the
burden of proof in establishing the amount of Losses suffered by it.

(d) Except with respect to the determination of whether there is an
affirmative requirement to schedule matters pursuant to _Sections 4.10(a)_ ,
_4.11(a)_ , _4.16(a)_ and _4.19(a)_ , in determining (i) whether any
representation or warranty in this Agreement was true and correct as of any
particular date and (ii) the amount of any Losses in respect of the failure
of any such representation or warranty to be true and correct as of any
particular date, any qualification or limitation as to materiality (whether by
reference to Material Adverse Effect or otherwise) contained in such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded.

12.3 _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

 

(a) Upon receipt of any notice of an Action or notice of any event that may
give rise to an Indemnification Claim (other than a Tax Claim) by a Person
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (each, an " _Indemnified
Party_ "), such Indemnified Party shall promptly (i) notify the Indemnitor and
(ii) deliver to the Indemnitor a written notice (w) describing in reasonable
detail the nature of the Action or event, (x) including a copy of all papers
served with respect to such Action or pertaining to such event, (y) including
the Indemnified Partys best estimate of the amount of Losses that may arise
from such Action or event and (z) describing in reasonable detail the basis
for the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement.
Failure to notify the Indemnitor in accordance with this _Section 12.3(a)_
will not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to the
Indemnified Party, except to the extent (A) the defense of such Action is
actually prejudiced by the Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice or
(B) the Indemnified Party fails to notify the Indemnitor of such
Indemnification Claim in accordance with this _Section 12.3(a)_ prior to the
Survival Expiration Date.

 

(b) An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the
defense of any Action subject to any such Indemnification Claim with counsel
of the Indemnitors choice and to settle or compromise any such Action, and
each Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate in all respects with the
conduct of such defense by the Indemnitor at the sole cost and expense of
the Indemnitor (including the making of any related claims, counterclaim or
cross complaint against any Person in connection with the Action) and/or the
settlement of such Action by the Indemnitor; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnitor will not agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to such Action without the Indemnified
Partys prior written approval (which must not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), unless the terms of such settlement provide for only payment of
money by the Indemnitor and includes a complete written release of the claims
that are the subject of such Action in favor of the Indemnified Party. If an
Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party will have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being understood,
however, that the Indemnitor will control such defense;  _provided_ , that in
connection with such participation, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
retain one counsel, selected by the Indemnified Party, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnitor to the extent an actual or potential conflict of
interest exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor in respect

 



67  of any such defense or settlement. The Indemnitor will be liable for the
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the defense thereof after the
Indemnified Party has provided the Indemnitor with notice pursuant to
_Sections 12.3(a)(i)_ and _12.3(a)(ii)_. If the Indemnified Party gives an
Indemnitor notice of an Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor does not
thereafter reasonably promptly assume such defense, then the Indemnified Party
may conduct the defense of such Action; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the
Indemnified Party will not agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement or compromise with respect to such Action without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and (B) the Indemnitor may thereafter assume at any time
the defense of such Action subject to the terms of this _Section 12.3_.

(c) At the reasonable request of the Indemnitor, each Indemnified Party shall
grant the Indemnitor and its representatives, at the sole cost and expense of
the Indemnitor, all reasonable access during business hours to the books,
records, employees and properties of such Indemnified Party to the extent
reasonably related to the matters to which the applicable Indemnification
Claim relates. All such access shall be granted during normal business hours
and shall be granted under conditions which shall not unreasonably
interfere with the business and operations of such Indemnified Party.

(d) With respect to any Indemnification Claim made by any Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_, the Holder Representative
shall, on behalf of the Company Equityholders, exercise all rights of the
Indemnitor as set forth in this _Article XII_; _provided_ , that the
Holder Representative shall not have any liability as an Indemnitor to any
Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article XII_ or otherwise.

 

12.4 _Limitations on Indemnification Liability_.

 

(a) The aggregate amount of Losses for which the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this  _Article XII_ will
not exceed the amount of funds available in the Indemnification Escrow
Account. The funds then remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Account shall
serve as the sole and exclusive source of payment of any Indemnification
Claim pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)_. The aggregate amount of Losses for which
the Company Equityholders shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this _Article XII_ will not exceed an amount equal to the Indemnification
Escrow Amount.

(b) The Parent Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to  _Section 12.2(a)(i)_ and the Company Equityholders shall only
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2(b)(i)_ to the extent
that the aggregate amount of all Losses (including costs and expenses of the
Parent Indemnified Parties or the Company Equityholders, as applicable,
incurred in connection with making such claim under this Agreement) incurred
by the Parent Indemnified Parties or the Company Equityholders, as applicable,
for which the Parent Indemnified Parties or the Company Equityholders, as
applicable, are entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 12.2(a)(i)_
or _Section 12.2(b)(i)_, as applicable, exceeds $3,300,000 (the "
_Deductible_ "), and the Parent Indemnified Parties or the Company
Equityholders, as applicable, shall be entitled to indemnification for such
Losses to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible; _provided_ , that the
Deductible shall not apply with respect to any Losses in connection with,
arising out of, or resulting from breaches of any Company Fundamental
Representations, Losses subject to indemnification under _Section
12.2(a)(iii)_, or fraud.

 



68 (c) All Losses for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under this _Article XII_ shall be reduced by the amount of
all insurance proceeds, indemnification payments and other third-party
recoveries actually realized by any Indemnified Party in respect of any
Losses incurred by such Indemnified Party. In the event any Indemnified Party
determines in good faith it is entitled to any insurance proceeds, indemnity
payments or any third-party recoveries in respect of any Losses (or any of
the circumstances giving rise thereto) for which such Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article XII_, such Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize
such reductions, proceeds, benefits, payments or recoveries. In the event that
any such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party
recoveries are actually obtained, received by an Indemnified Party subsequent
to receipt by such Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment hereunder
in respect of the claims to which such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments
or other third-party recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made
promptly by the relevant Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant portion of
such indemnification payment.

(d) If any Indemnified Party receives any indemnification payment pursuant to
this _Article XII_, at the election of the Indemnitor, such Indemnified Party
shall assign to the Indemnitor all of its claims for recovery against third
Persons as to such Losses, whether by insurance coverage, contribution
claims, subrogation or otherwise.

(e) For the purposes of this  _Article XII_, notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in no event shall any Indemnitor be liable for any
consequential damages, special damages, punitive damages, lost profits (except
with respect to Losses for lost profits to the extent a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that lost profits is the appropriate measure of direct
damages with respect to the matters giving rise to the claim for Losses),
damages calculated as a multiple of earnings or revenue, diminution in value
or loss of business reputation or opportunity, except in each case to the
extent payable to a third party in connection with an Action for which
recovery is provided under this _Article XII_.

 

(f) No Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any
Losses in respect of any liability included in the calculation of the
Aggregate Consideration.

(g) In the event a Parent Indemnified Party actually recovers Losses in
respect of an Indemnification Claim, no other Parent Indemnified Party may
recover the same Losses in respect of a claim for indemnification under this
Agreement.

12.5  _Mitigation of Losses_. An Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article XII_. The Indemnitor shall have the
right, but not the obligation, and shall be afforded the opportunity by the
Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably possible, to take all available
steps to minimize Losses for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification before such Losses actually are incurred by the Indemnified
Party.

 



69 12.6 _Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Each of the Parties
acknowledges and agrees that from and after the Closing, except in the case
of fraud, claims under this _Article XII_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
funds available in the Indemnification Escrow Account shall be the sole
source of recovery of the Parent Indemnified Parties. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each of the Parties and each of the Parent Indemnified Parties
hereby waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may
have against any indemnifying party and its Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, agents and representatives relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement based upon predecessor or successor liability, contribution, tort,
strict liability or any Law or otherwise; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, this _Section 12.6_ shall
not relieve any Party for any liability for fraud. All representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement are contractual in nature only and
subject to the sole and exclusive remedies set forth in this _Article XII_.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

(a) the provisions of and the limited remedies provided in this _Article XII_
were specifically bargained for between the Parties and were taken into
account by the Parties in arriving at the Aggregate Consideration;

(b) the Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities
and obligations respecting the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of
this Agreement; and

 

(c) the Parties each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the
justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arms-length
negotiations and the Parties specifically acknowledge that no Party has any
special relationship with another Party that would justify any expectation
beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arms-length
transaction.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Adjustment Amount shall not be considered
"remedies" for purposes of this _Section 12.6_ and shall not be limited by
the terms of this _Section 12.6_.

 

12.7 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any amount that is paid pursuant
to this _Article XII_ shall be treated by the Parties for Tax purposes as an
adjustment of the Aggregate Consideration, except as otherwise required by
applicable Law.

ARTICLE XIII.

written

 



72  consent of the other Parties; provided, that Parent and Merger Sub may
assign this Agreement and their rights hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Company to one or more of their Affiliates, but no such

inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns.

13.4 _Rights of Third Parties_. Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement
is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person, other
than the Parties, any right or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing (i) in the event
the Closing occurs, the present and former officers and directors of the
Company (and their successors, heirs and representatives) are intended third-
party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, _Section 7.2_, (ii) from and after
the Effective Time, the Company Equityholders (and their successors, heirs

incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions herein
contemplated whether or not such transactions shall be consummated, including
all fees of its legal counsel, financial advisers and accountants; _provided_

relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled). 

13.6 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action based upon, arising out
of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State
of Delaware, without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws
to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit

of this Agreement necessary to effect the Merger pursuant to the Laws of the
State of Colorado, which provisions shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of

 



73  Colorado, without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws
to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application
of Laws of another jurisdiction;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any action
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby that involves any of the Financing Sources shall be

result in the application of the laws of any other State.

 

(b) THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT BY ANY OF
THEM AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY AND ANY OF THE FINANCING SOURCES IN ANY MATTERS
ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

13.7 _Captions; Counterparts_. The captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and shall not be considered a part of or affect the
construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to
this Agreement by facsimile or scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of
a manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

13.8 _Schedules and Exhibits_. The Schedules (including the Company Disclosure
Schedules and the Parent Disclosure Schedules) and Exhibits referenced herein
are a part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All references
herein to Schedules and Exhibits shall be deemed references to such parts of
this Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise require. Any disclosure
made by a party in the Schedules with reference to any section or schedule of
this Agreement shall be deemed to be a disclosure with respect to any other
sections or schedules to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face
that such disclosure is relevant to such other section or schedule contained
in this Agreement. Certain information set forth in the Schedules is included
solely for informational purposes and may not be required to be
disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. The disclosure of any information shall
not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such information is
required to be disclosed in connection with the representations and warranties
made in this Agreement, nor shall such information be deemed to establish a
standard of materiality.

13.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Schedules and
Exhibits to this Agreement), the Escrow Agreement and that certain Mutual
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April 21, 2015, by and between Parent
and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties relating to the transactions contemplated hereby
and supersede any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have
been made or entered into by or among any of the Parties or any of their
respective Subsidiaries relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. No
representations, warranties, covenants, understandings, agreements, oral or
otherwise, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exist
between the Parties except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



74 13.10 _Amendments_.

 

(a) This Agreement may be amended or modified in whole or in part, only by a
duly authorized agreement in writing executed by each of the Parties in the
same manner as this Agreement and which makes reference to this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any party seeks an
amendment, modification, consent or waiver to any of _Section 13.4_, _Section
13.6_, _Section 13.13(b)_, this _Section 13.10(b)_ or the last sentence of
_Section 13.15_ that is adverse to the Financing Sources, the prior written
consent of the Financing Sources shall be required before any such amendment,
modification, consent or waiver may become effective.

 

13.11 _Publicity_. Through and including the Closing Date, all press releases
or other public communications of any nature whatsoever relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the method of the release for
publication thereof, shall be subject to the prior mutual approval of Parent
and the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed by any Party, unless such Party determines,
after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law
or by the listing rules of a national securities exchange or trading market to
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in
which event such Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Parties to
review and comment upon such press release or other announcement and shall
give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto.

 

13.12 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The Parties further
agree that if any provision contained herein is, to any extent, held invalid
or unenforceable in any respect under the Laws governing this Agreement,
they shall take any actions necessary to render the remaining provisions of
this Agreement valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by Law
and, to the extent necessary, shall amend or otherwise modify this Agreement
to replace any provision contained herein that is held invalid or
unenforceable with a valid and enforceable provision giving effect to the
intent of the Parties.

 

13.13 _Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 13.6(b)_ and _Section 13.13(b)_ below, any Action
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any other court of the
State of Delaware or, in the case of claims to which the federal courts have
exclusive subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court of the United States
of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and each of the Parties
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any
such Action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to personal
jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in
respect of the Action shall be heard and determined only in any such court,
and agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing
herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of any party to serve
process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or
otherwise proceed against any other party in any other jurisdiction, in each
case, to enforce judgments obtained in any Action, suit or proceeding brought
pursuant to this _Section 13.13(a)_.

 



75 (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge
and irrevocably agree (i) that any Action, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources
arising out of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby or the
Financing or related thereto shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
of any New York State court or Federal court of the United States of America
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, and each Party hereto
submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Action to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (ii) not to bring or permit any of their
Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Action in any
other court and (iii) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such Action in any such court.

 

13.14 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that (a) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof,
without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 10.1_, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement, (b) the availability of
monetary damages shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any
respect any Partys right to specific enforcement and (c) the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would
have entered into this Agreement. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or
equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 13.14_
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
any such injunction.

13.15 _Non-Recourse_. Without limiting the rights of the Parties under
_Section 13.14_, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the entities
that are expressly named as Parties hereto and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party; provided,
however that nothing herein shall limit the rights and remedies of the Parties
and their respective Affiliates under the Confidentiality Agreement. Without
limiting the rights of the Parties under _Section 13.14_ or the Parties
respective rights and remedies under the Confidentiality Agreement, except to
the extent a named Party hereto (and then only to the extent of the specific
obligations undertaken by such named Party in this Agreement), (i) no past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager,
partner, equityholder, Affiliate, agent, 

 



76  attorney, advisor or representative or Affiliate of any named Party and (ii)
no past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
manager, partner, equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, advisor or
representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any liability
(whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations or
liabilities of any one or more of the Parties (whether for indemnification or
otherwise) of or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, agrees that the Financing Sources shall be subject
to no liability or claims by the Company or its Affiliates, whether at law, or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or in connection with the Financing or the performance of services
by the Financing Sources with respect to the foregoing. In no event shall the
Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this
Agreement against the Financing Sources.

13.16 _Acknowledgement and Waiver_.

 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Holder Representative
has retained Latham and Watkins, LLP (" _L andW_") and the Company has retained
LandW and Sherman and Howard L.L.C. (" _S andH_") to act as their respective counsel
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that neither
LandW nor SandH has acted as counsel for any other Person in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby for conflict of interest or any other
purposes. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree that any attorney-client
privilege and the expectation of client confidence attaching as a result of
LandWs representation of the Company or the Holder Representative or SandHs
representation of the Company related to the preparation for, and negotiation
and consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including all communications among LandW and the Company, the Company
Equityholders, the Holder Representatives and/or their respective Affiliates
or SandH and the Company and its Affiliates related to the preparation for, and
negotiation and consummation of, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect. Furthermore,
effective as of the Closing, (i) all communications (and materials relating
thereto) between the Company and its Subsidiaries and LandW or SandH related to
the preparation for, and negotiation and consummation of, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are hereby assigned and transferred to the
Holder Representative, (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries hereby release
all of their respective rights and interests to and in such communications and
related materials and (iii) the Company and its Subsidiaries hereby release
any right to assert or waive any privilege related to the communications
referenced in this _Section 13.16,_ the Company and its Subsidiaries
acknowledge and agree that all such rights shall reside with the Holder
Representative.

 

(b) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree that, notwithstanding any current
or prior representation of the Company by LandW, LandW shall be allowed to
represent any Company Equityholder, the Holder Representative or any of their
respective Affiliates in any matters and disputes adverse to Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company that either is existing on the date hereof or arises
in the future and relates to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; and Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby waive any conflicts or
claim of privilege that may arise in connection with such representation.
Further, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree that, in the event that a
dispute arises after Closing between Parent, Merger Sub or the

 



77  Company and any Company Equityholder, the Holder Representative or any of
their respective Affiliates, LandW may represent such Company Equityholder, the
Holder Representative or Affiliate in such dispute even though the interests
of such Company Equityholder, the Holder Representative or Affiliate may be
directly adverse to Parent or the Company and even though LandW may have
represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that any advice given to or
communication with any Company Equityholder, the Holder Representative or any
of their respective Affiliates (other than the Company) shall not be subject
to any joint privilege and shall be owned solely by such Company Equityholder,
the Holder Representative and any Affiliate of each such party. Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company each hereby acknowledge that each of them have had
the opportunity to discuss and obtain adequate information concerning the
significance and material risks of, and reasonable available alternatives to,
the waivers, permissions and other provisions of this Agreement, including
the opportunity to consult with counsel other than LandW.
