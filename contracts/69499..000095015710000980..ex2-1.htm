(B) the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, (C) the Closing Funded
Indebtedness Amount, (D) the amount of each Company Transaction Expense, (E)

Table of Contents

 

 

  

  

  

(B) $4,000,000 (such amount, the "Sellers' Representative Fund") shall be
deposited into an account designated by the Seller's Representative to Buyer;

  

  

(C) each of the Sellers holding Shares shall as legal and beneficial owner
sell, assign, transfer and convey to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase
and acquire from each Seller, all of the Shares owned by such Seller, against
payment by Buyer at the Closing, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated by such Seller, such Seller's Allocation
Percentage of an amount (the "Closing Payment") equal to (1) the Closing
Consideration minus (2) the Sellers' Representative Fund minus (3) the Escrow

(D) each of the Other Shareholders shall as legal and beneficial owner sell,

(iii) Determination of Final Net Working Capital, Final Cash Amount and Final

(A) As soon as practicable, but no later than forty-five (45) days after the
Closing Date, the Company shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company to, prepare
and deliver to the Sellers' Representative Buyer's good faith calculations of
each of Net Working Capital, the Cash Amount, the Tax Liabilities Amount and
the Funded Indebtedness Amount, in each case, including the components thereof
and in a manner consistent with the definition thereof (the "True-Up
Calculations"). If Buyer fails to timely deliver the True-Up Calculations in
accordance with the foregoing, then, at the election of the Sellers'
Representative in its sole discretion, either (1) no adjustment shall be made
pursuant to Section 2(a)(iv) or (2) the Sellers' Representative shall retain
(at the expense of Buyer) a nationally recognized, independent accounting firm
to provide a review of the Company and its Subsidiaries' books and make an
independent calculation of each of Net Working Capital, the Cash Amount, the
Tax Liabilities Amount and the Funded Indebtedness Amount, each such
calculation of such accounting firm being final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties hereto. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, make its financial records available to the Sellers' Representative and
its advisors (or such independent accounting firm retained by the Sellers'
Representative, as the case may be) in connection with any review conducted in
connection with this Section 2(a)(iii)(A).

(B) If the Sellers' Representative does not give written notice of any dispute
(a "Dispute Notice") to Buyer within forty-five (45) days of receiving the
True-Up Calculations, the Sellers and Buyer agree that the True-Up
Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the Final Net Working Capital, the
Final Cash Amount, the Final Tax Liabilities Amount and the Final Funded
Indebtedness Amount for all purposes hereunder. Prior to the end of such
forty-five (45) day period, the Sellers' Representative may accept any of the
True-Up Calculations by delivering written notice to that effect to Buyer, in
which case the applicable amounts will be finally determined when such notice
is given. If the Sellers' Representative gives a Dispute Notice to Buyer
within such forty-five (45) day period, Buyer and the Sellers' Representative
shall use reasonable best efforts to resolve the dispute during the forty-five
(45) day period commencing on the date Buyer receives the Dispute Notice from
the Sellers' Representative. If the Sellers' Representative and Buyer do not
agree upon a final resolution with respect to any disputed items within such
forty-five (45) day period, then the remaining items in dispute shall be
submitted immediately to Deloitte and Touche LLP, or, if such firm declines to
be retained to resolve the dispute, another nationally recognized, independent
accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Buyer and the Sellers' Representative
(in either case, the "Consultant"). The Consultant shall be requested to
render a determination of the applicable dispute within forty-five (45) days
after referral of the matter to such Consultant, which determination must be
in writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The
terms of appointment and engagement of the Consultant shall be as agreed upon
between the Sellers' Representative and Buyer. In resolving the disputed
items, the Consultant shall (i) make an independent calculation of the
aggregate amount of all such disputed items in a manner consistent with the
applicable definitions (the "Consultant Amount") and (ii) resolve all such
items by choosing either (A) the aggregate amount for all such items set forth
in the True-Up Calculations (the "Buyer Proposed Amount") or (B) the aggregate
amount for all such items set forth in the Dispute Notice (the "Seller
Proposed Amount"), based upon which aggregate amount is closer to the
Consultant Amount. Any engagement fees payable to the Consultant shall be
borne by (x) the Sellers and Other Shareholders if the Consultant chooses the
Buyer Proposed Amount or (y) the Buyer if the Consultant chooses the Seller
Proposed Amount. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, all
other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving
any dispute hereunder before the Consultant shall be borne by the Party
incurring such cost and expense. Such determination of the Consultant shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Parties. The Parties shall revise the True-Up
Calculations to reflect the resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to
this Section 2(a)(iii)(B) and, as so revised, such True-Up Calculations shall
be deemed to set forth the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Cash Amount,
the Final Tax Liabilities Amount and the Final Funded Indebtedness Amount for
all purposes hereunder.

(C) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, make its
financial records and personnel available to the Sellers' Representative, its
accountants and other representatives and the Consultant at reasonable times
during the review by the Sellers' Representative and the Consultant of, and
the resolution of any objections with respect to, the True-Up Calculations.

  

  

(iv) Net Working Capital, Cash Amount, Tax Liabilities Amount and Funded
Indebtedness Amount Adjustment.

  

  

(A) If (1) the Final Net Working Capital plus the Final Cash Amount minus the
Final Tax Liabilities Amount minus the Final Funded Indebtedness Amount (the
"Final Adjustment Amount") is greater than (2) the Closing Net Working Capital
plus the Closing Cash Amount minus the Closing Tax Liabilities Amount minus
the Closing Funded Indebtedness Amount (the "Closing Adjustment Amount"), then
within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the last of Final Net
Working Capital, the Final Cash Amount, the Final Tax Liabilities Amount and
the Final Funded Indebtedness Amount is determined, Buyer shall pay to the
accounts of each Seller or Other Shareholder such Seller's or Other
Shareholder's Allocation Percentage of an amount equal to the excess of the
Final Adjustment Amount over the Closing Adjustment Amount by wire transfer or
delivery of immediately available funds.

  

  

(B) If the Final Adjustment Amount is less than the Closing Adjustment Amount,
then within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the last of Final
Net Working Capital, the Final Cash Amount, the Final Tax Liabilities Amount
and the Final Funded Indebtedness Amount is determined, Buyer and the Sellers'
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to Buyer an amount equal to the excess
of the Closing Adjustment Amount over the Final Adjustment Amount from the
Escrow Funds (which, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, shall be the sole source of recovery for any payment required to be
made pursuant to this Section 2(a)(iv)(B)).

  

  

(b) The Closing.

  

  

(i) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 300 North
LaSalle, Chicago, Illinois at 10:00 a.m. on the later of (A) the second (2nd)
Business Day following full satisfaction or due waiver of all of the closing
conditions set forth in Section 7 hereof (other than those to be satisfied at

other date as is mutually agreeable to the Buyer and the Sellers. The date and

6. Post-Closing Covenants. The Parties agree as follows with respect to the period following the Closing.

  

  

(a) General. In the event that at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the
Parties shall take such further action (including the execution and delivery
of such further instruments and documents) as another Party may reasonably
request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party. The Buyer
agrees to retain records material to the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the period prior to the Closing and make them available to
the Sellers and Other Shareholders for a period of three (3) years after the
Closing, or, in the alternative, to notify the Sellers' Representative in
writing at least thirty (30) days prior to their disposal at any time prior to
the expiration of such period and permit the Sellers' Representative to have
access to such records.

  

  

(b) Litigation Support. In the event and for so long as any Party actively is
contesting or defending against any action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand in connection with (i) any
transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation,
circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event,
incident, action, failure to act or transaction on or prior to the Closing
Date involving either of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each of the
other Parties shall cooperate with such Party or its counsel in the defense or
contest, make available their personnel and provide such testimony and access
to their books and records as shall be reasonably requested in connection with
the defense or contest, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or
defending Party; provided that this Section 6(b) shall not apply with respect
to any actual or threatened litigation or dispute among the Parties.

  

  

(c) Tax Matters.

  

  

(i) Cooperation. The Parties shall cooperate with each other to provide each
other with such assistance as may be reasonably requested by them in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Returns and any Tax audit or other
examination in connection with an administrative or judicial proceeding
involving a Tax Authority relating to Tax.

  

  

(ii) Post-Closing Actions.

  

  

(A) The Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns and Tax Claims for the Company and its Subsidiaries that
are due after the Closing Date. With respect to any such Tax Return or Tax
Claim that would reasonably be expected to give rise, directly or indirectly,
to an obligation to provide an indemnity to the Buyer under this Agreement,
including Section 9(c), the Buyer shall permit the Sellers' Representative to
review and comment on each such Tax Return or Tax Claim prior to filing and
shall consider in good faith such revisions to such Tax Returns or Tax Claims
as are reasonably requested by Sellers' Representative. The Buyer and the
Company, on the one hand, and Sellers' Representative, on the other hand,
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Parties, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and Tax Claims. Such
cooperation shall include, upon Sellers' Representative's request, providing
records and information (including all information necessary to comply with
subpart F and section 1248 of the Code) that are reasonably relevant to any
such matters, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explaining any materials provided in
connection with this Section 6(c)(ii).

(B) Neither Buyer, the Company nor any of their Affiliates shall make any
election under Code § 338 with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Directors' and Officers' Exculpation and Indemnification; Insurance.

  

  

(i) All rights to exculpation or indemnification existing in favor of
directors, officers, members, managers, or employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as provided in the Constitutive Documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as in effect on the date hereof, with respect to matters
occurring through the Closing Date, will survive the transactions contemplated
hereby and will continue in full force and effect thereafter for a period of
six (6) years.

  

  

(ii) As of the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Company to purchase
officers', directors' and managers' liability tail insurance or other
liability insurance that covers events occurring prior to the Closing,
including in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, on terms and in amounts no less favorable to its officers, directors
and managers than the officers', directors' and managers' liability insurance
policy of the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement (a correct and
complete copy of which has been provided to the Buyer) (the "Existing DandO
Policy") for a period of six (6) years after the Closing (the "DandO Tail
Policy"); provided that in no event shall the Buyer be required to pay, with
respect to the entire six-year period following the Closing, premiums for
insurance under this Section 6(d)(ii) that in the aggregate exceed 150% of the
annual premiums payable by the Company for coverage during calendar year 2009
under the Existing DandO Policy (which premiums for such year are hereby
represented and warranted by the Company to be €18,450). If such prepaid
policies have been obtained prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to maintain such
policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder. If the Company, the Subsidiaries or any of their respective
successors or assigns (A) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (B) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Company and
the Subsidiaries shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section
6(d).

  

  

(iii) This Section 6(d) is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the present and former officers, directors and managers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, their heirs and personal representatives and
shall be binding on the Buyer and its successors and assigns and is in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise.

  

  

(e) Designation and Replacement of the Sellers' Representative. The Parties
have agreed that it is desirable to designate the Sellers' Representative to
act on behalf of the Sellers and the Optionholders for certain limited
purposes, as specified herein. The execution of this Agreement by the Sellers
and the Optionholders shall, to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable
Law, constitute irrevocable ratification and approval of such designation by
the Sellers and the Optionholders and authorization of the Sellers'
Representative to serve in such capacity (including to settle any and all
disputes with Buyer under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement), and shall
also constitute a reaffirmation, approval, acceptance and adoption of, and an
agreement to comply with and perform, all of the acknowledgments and
agreements made by the Sellers' Representative on behalf of the Sellers and
the Optionholders in this Agreement and the other documents delivered in
connection herewith (including the Escrow Agreement). The Sellers'
Representative may resign at any time. The designation of the Sellers'
Representative is coupled with an interest, and, except as set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, such designation is irrevocable and shall not
be affected by the death, incapacity, illness, bankruptcy, dissolution or
other inability to act on behalf of any of the Sellers or the Optionholders. A
new Sellers' Representative may be appointed at any time by the vote of
Persons which collectively own more than 50% of the Shares issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior the Closing, such appointment to become
effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new Sellers'
Representative. Written notice of any resignation or appointment of the
Sellers' Representative shall be delivered by the Sellers' Representative to
Buyer promptly after such action is taken.

(f) Authority and Rights of the Sellers' Representative; Limitations on
Liability. The Sellers' Representative shall have such powers and authority as
are necessary or appropriate to carry out the functions assigned to it under
this Agreement and in any other document delivered in connection herewith
(including the Escrow Agreement), including all (and the exclusive) power and
authority to settle any and all disputes with Buyer under this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement and to amend this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby in any and all respects on behalf of all of the Sellers
and the Optionholders, in each case, as the Sellers' Representative determines
in its sole discretion, which settlements and amendments shall bind all of the
Sellers and the Optionholders hereto as if such Sellers and Optionholders made
such settlement or executed such amendment; provided, however, that the
Sellers' Representative will have no obligation to act on behalf of the
Sellers and the Optionholders. The Company, Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to rely on the actions taken by the Sellers' Representative
without independent inquiry into the capacity of the Sellers' Representative
to so act. All actions, notices, communications and determinations by the
Sellers' Representative to carry out such functions shall conclusively be
deemed to have been authorized by, and shall be binding upon, the Sellers and
the Optionholders. Neither the Sellers' Representative nor any of its agents
or representatives shall have any liability to the Sellers or the
Optionholders with respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Sellers' Representative in such capacity (or any of its agents or
representatives in connection therewith), except with respect to the Sellers'
Representative's willful misconduct. The Sellers' Representative shall be
entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as
it shall deem necessary in connection with exercising its powers and
performing its function hereunder and (in the absence of bad faith on the part
of the Sellers' Representative) shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the
opinions and advice of such Persons. The Sellers' Representative (for itself
and its agents and representatives) shall be entitled to full reimbursement
for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including fees and
disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and consultants)
incurred by the Sellers' Representative in such capacity (or any of its agents
or representatives in connection therewith), and to full indemnification
against any loss, liability or expenses arising out of actions taken or
omitted to be taken in its capacity as Sellers' Representative (except for
those arising out of the Sellers' Representative's willful misconduct),
including the costs and expenses of investigation and defense of claims, from
the Sellers or the Optionholders (including from funds paid to the Sellers'
Representative under this Agreement or otherwise received by it in its
capacity as Sellers' Representative, or funds to be distributed to the Sellers
and the Optionholders under this Agreement at its direction, pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement (including under the Escrow Agreement)). In
furtherance of the foregoing, the Sellers' Representative shall have the power
and authority to set aside and retain funds paid to or received by it (or to
be paid to or received by the Sellers and the Optionholders) pursuant to this
Agreement at Closing or thereafter, to satisfy such obligations (including to
establish such reserves as the Sellers' Representative determines in good
faith to be appropriate for such costs and expenses that are not then known or
determinable). The relationship created herein is not to be construed as a
joint venture or any form of partnership between or among the Sellers'
Representative or any of the Sellers or Optionholders for any purpose. Neither
the Sellers' Representative nor any of its Affiliates owes any fiduciary or
other duty to any of the Sellers or Optionholders.

shareholder in, or independent director of, a Portfolio Company) shall not,

"Listed Competing Product") or (B) any injectable product (other than any
Listed Competing Product) incorporating any active pharmaceutical ingredient
or utilizing any brand name set forth on Section 3(d)(iii) of the Disclosure
Schedule or the Additional Products List (each such product, an "Unlisted
Competing Product") in the territories in which any Product is approved,
marketed or proposed to be marketed as of the Closing Date; provided, however,
that, in the case of clause (B) only, during the Restricted Period, RoundTable
or one of its Affiliates may acquire one (1) business that develops,
investigates, tests, manufactures, markets, distributes or sells Unlisted
Competing Products so long as on the date of the closing of such acquisition
or within six (6) months immediately following the closing of such acquisition
(through the divestiture of Unlisted Competing Products) the aggregate net
sales of such Unlisted Competing Products in such acquired business account
for less than ten percent (10%) of the total net sales in such acquired
business.

  

  

(ii) During the Restricted Period, RoundTable agrees that RoundTable and each
of its Affiliates (except (1) its or their respective limited partners or (2)
for the avoidance of doubt, any minority shareholder in, or independent
director of, a Portfolio Company), and each of Steven Thornton and George
Zorich agrees that such Person, shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit,

or consultant to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Buyer to cease or
curtail his or her relationship therewith; provided, however, that the

(ii) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"): (A) real, personal and intangible property
and other Taxes not measured by income or receipts for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be equal to the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period; and (B)
Taxes (other than those Taxes described in clause (A)) for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close of
business on the Closing Date, and in the case of any Taxes attributable to the
ownership of any equity interest in any partnership or other "flowthrough"
entity, as if a taxable period of such partnership or other "flowthrough"
entity ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date. The Parties
agree that for Tax purposes all deductions, credits and other items arising
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
with respect to the Options, will not be taken into account in the Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

  

  

(iii) The Sellers and the Optionholders jointly and severally warrant to the
Buyer Indemnitees that all documents forming part of the title to any material
asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries may wish to enforce or produce in evidence, which are
required to be stamped by Applicable Law, are duly stamped and have, where
appropriate, been adjudicated. If this warranty is untrue with respect to any
document required to be stamped under Applicable Law and Buyer and Seller's
Representative agree that it is necessary under Applicable Law to procure
stamping of such document, then the Sellers and the Optionholders shall
indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees in an amount equal to any unpaid stamp duty
and any interest or penalties payable in respect thereof, and Buyer shall
promptly pay over such amount to the relevant Governmental Authority.

  

  

(iv) The Buyer hereby covenants with the Sellers to pay to the Sellers or any
Person falling within the meaning of section 629(4) of TCA 1997 (or its
equivalent in any other jurisdiction) an amount equal to any Tax for which the
Company is primarily liable to pay in respect of an event occurring after the
Closing, but which the Sellers or any Person falling within the meaning of
section 629(4) of TCA 1997 become liable to pay as a result of a failure on
the part of the Company to pay such Tax, except to the extent that the Tax for
which the Sellers or any Person falling within section 629(4) of TCA 1997 is
liable has been recovered under section 629(5) of TCA 1997.

  

  

(d) Procedures.

  

  

(i) Third Party Claims.

  

  

(A) If a claim, action, suit or proceeding by a Person who is not a Party or
an Affiliate thereof is made against any Indemnified Party (a "Third Party
Claim"), and if such Person intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto
under this Section 9, such Indemnified Party shall promptly give a Notice of
Claim to the Indemnifying Party; provided that failure to give such
notification on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter,
the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, within three
(3) Business Days after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified
Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

Table of Contents

 

 

  

  

  

(B) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it elects, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not, except with the
written consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement that (1)
does not include as a term thereof the giving by the Person(s) asserting such
claim to all Indemnified Parties of a release from all liability with respect
to such claim or consent to entry of any judgment or (2) provides for
injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnified Party. If an
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal fees
or expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Indemnifying Party, but with it being understood, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any
Third Party Claim (and shall be liable for the legal fees and expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such Third Party Claim) if (x)
the Indemnified Party has determined in good faith that the Losses which may
be incurred as a result of the Third Party Claim exceed, either individually
or when aggregated with all other claims, the Escrow Funds remaining at such
time, (y) the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable
relief or relief for other than money damages against the Indemnified Party
which the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after conferring with its
counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages or (z)
the Indemnifying Party is also a party and joint representation would be
inappropriate or there may be legal defenses available to the Indemnified
Party which are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall also be liable for the legal
fees and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party for any period during
which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense of any Third Party
Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not, except with the written consent
of the Indemnifying Party, enter into any settlement that does not include as
a term thereof the giving by the Person(s) asserting such claim to all
Indemnified Parties of a release from all liability with respect to such claim
or consent to entry of any judgment.

  

  

(C) All of the Parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder and each Party (or a duly authorized representative of such
Party) shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to) furnish such records,
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection
therewith.

  

  

(ii) Direct Claims. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
against any Indemnifying Party under this Section 9 that does not involve a
Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party (a "Direct Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly
give a Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party; provided that failure to
give such notification on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have
been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15)
days following its receipt of such notice that it disputes its liability to
the Indemnified Party, such Direct Claim specified by the Indemnified Party in
such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability subject to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9. If the Indemnifying Party has
timely disputed its liability with respect to such Direct Claim as provided
above, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall attempt to
resolve in good faith such dispute within forty-five (45) days of the
Indemnifying Party providing notice to the Indemnified Party of the dispute of
liability (it being understood that such good faith attempt shall not require
either party to submit the dispute to arbitration). If such dispute is not so
resolved within such forty-five (45) day period, then either party may
initiate a lawsuit with respect to the subject matter of such dispute in
accordance with, and subject to the limitations of, Section 10.

(e) Limitations on Indemnification Obligations. The rights of an Indemnified
Party to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of Section 9(b) and
Section 9(c) are subject to the following limitations:

  

  

(i) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover individual Losses
pursuant to Section 9(b)(i)(A) or Section 9(c)(i)(E) if the total amount of
such individual Loss which the Buyer Indemnitees would recover under Section
9(b)(i)(A) or Section 9(c)(i)(E) (as limited by the provisions of Section
9(e)(iv)), but for this Section 9(e)(i), is less than $10,000 (the "Mini-
Basket"); provided that (A) a series of related Losses shall be aggregated for
purposes of this Section 9(e)(i) and (B) Losses that are less than the Mini-
Basket shall be disregarded for purposes of Section 9(e)(iii);

  

  

(ii) the Buyer Indemnitees shall have no right to indemnification pursuant to
Section 9(b)(i)(A) for Losses that are incurred to clean up or otherwise
remediate any Hazardous Materials to the extent such cleanup or other
remediation is not conducted in a reasonably cost-effective manner, taking
into consideration (A) use of the relevant property (with respect to the
Leased Property, as of the Closing Date), (B) applicable Environmental
Requirements, (C) available risk-based approaches, engineering controls,
institutional controls, deed restrictions and activity and use limitations (if
any) under applicable Environmental Requirements and permitted by the relevant
Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over the matter, (D) impact or threat to
the environment or human health and (E) impact to or interference with the
operations of the Buyer Indemnitees; provided that in no event shall such
cleanup or other remediation be deemed to have not been conducted in a
reasonably cost-effective manner for the purposes of the foregoing clause on
the basis that such cleanup or other remediation does not include any
engineering or institutional controls or other activity and use limitations or
deed restrictions or is not based on any risk-based approach where such
restrictions, limitations, controls or approach would unreasonably interfere
with Buyer Indemnitees' operation of the relevant property.

  

  

(iii) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant
to Section 9(b)(i)(A) or Section 9(c)(i)(E) until the total amount which the
Buyer Indemnitees would recover under Section 9(b)(i)(A) and Section
9(c)(i)(E) (as limited by the provisions of Section 9(e)(iv)), but for this
Section 9(e)(iii), exceeds $2,750,000 (the "Deductible"), in which case, the
Buyer Indemnitees shall only be entitled to recover such Losses in excess of
such amount;

  

  

(iv) the funds in the Escrow Account, at any given time, shall be the sole and
exclusive source of recovery with respect to Losses indemnifiable pursuant to
Section 9(b) and Section 9(c), and shall limit the liability of the Sellers
and Optionholders, and in no event shall the Buyer Indemnitees be entitled to
recover, or the liability of the Sellers and Optionholders exceed, more than
the amount of the funds available in the Escrow Account pursuant to Section
2(a)(iv)(B), Section 9(b) and Section 9(c) in the aggregate;

  

  

(v) if an Indemnified Party does not use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate Losses for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification
pursuant to Section 9(b) or Section 9(c), the Indemnifying Party shall not be
required to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent any such Losses
could have been mitigated if the Indemnified Party had used such commercially
reasonable efforts;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

Table of Contents

 

 

  

  

  

(vi) the amount of each Loss shall be determined net of any amounts actually
recovered by the Indemnified Party which suffered such Loss under insurance
policies or from other collateral sources (such as contractual indemnities of
any Person which are contained outside of this Agreement) with respect to such
Loss; provided that such Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue such recovery under available insurance policies or other
available collateral sources;

  

  

(vii) in any case where an Indemnified Party recovers, under insurance
policies or from other collateral sources, any amount in respect of a matter
for which such Indemnified Party was indemnified pursuant to Section 9(b) or
Section 9(c), such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the
Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the
amount of the expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in procuring such
recovery), but not in excess of the sum of any amount previously so paid to or
on behalf of such Indemnified Party in respect of such matter;

  

  

(viii) in no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to recover or make
a claim for any amounts in respect of special or indirect damages, lost
revenues, income or profits, loss in value or diminution in value, of
securities or assets or punitive damages and, in particular, no "multiple of
profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar valuation methodology shall be
used in calculating the amount of any Losses, unless, in each case, paid or
payable (and subsequently paid) to a third party; and

  

  

(ix) for the avoidance of doubt, neither the Mini-Basket nor the Deductible
shall be applicable to the indemnification obligations set forth in subclauses
(B), (C), (D), (E) or (F) of Section 9(b)(i) or subclauses (A), (B), (C), (D),
(F), (G) or (H) of Section 9(c)(i).

  

  

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 9 to the contrary, no
indemnification obligation of any Indemnifying Party under this Agreement that
has been finally judicially determined to have resulted from fraud on the part
of any Indemnifying Party shall be subject to any limitation set forth above
in this Section 9(e); provided that in no event shall the Buyer Indemnitees be
entitled to recover Losses in the aggregate, under this Section 9, any other
Section of this Agreement or any combination thereof or otherwise, in excess
of the Final Purchase Price.

  

  

(f) Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Section 9 shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy for the Parties for (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty contained herein or in any certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) subject to Section 10(o), any failure to
perform any covenant or agreement contained herein, in each case, other than
any such breach or failure that has been finally judicially determined to have
resulted from fraud. In furtherance of the foregoing, except in the case of a
final judicial determination of fraud, no Indemnified Party may avoid the
limitations on liability set forth in this Section 9 by seeking damages or
claims for breach of contract, tort, rescission or pursuant to any other
theory of liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, in no event shall the Buyer Indemnitees be entitled to recover Losses
in the aggregate, under this Section 9, any other Section of this Agreement or
any combination thereof or otherwise, in excess of the Final Purchase Price.

(g) Manner of Payment; Escrow.

  

  

(i) Except as provided in Section 9(g)(ii), any indemnification of the Buyer
Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to this Section 9 shall be
effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the applicable
Persons to an account designated in writing by the applicable Buyer
Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as the case may be, within fifteen (15)
days after the final determination thereof; provided, however, that any
indemnification owed by the Sellers to the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to
Section 9(b)(i)(A) may only be satisfied from the Escrow Funds pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(ii) Any indemnification pursuant to Section 9(c) ("Tax Indemnification"),
other than an indemnification related to a Direct Claim, shall be effected by
wire transfer of immediately available funds from the applicable Persons to an
account designated in writing by the applicable Buyer Indemnitees or Seller
Indemnitees, as the case may be, (A) in the case of Tax Indemnification for a
Tax liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is not yet due
and payable, five (5) Business Days before the latest date on which such Tax
liability becomes due and payable and (B) in the case of any other Tax
Indemnification, fourteen (14) Business Days after the date of delivery of the
Notice of Claim; provided, however, that any indemnification owed by the
Sellers to the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to Section 9(b)(i)(A) may only be
satisfied from the Escrow Funds pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.
For purposes of this Section 9(g)(ii), references to a date on which a Tax
liability becomes due and payable include a reference to the date on which it
would have become due were it not for the availability of some Post-Closing
Relief or right to repayment of Tax.

  

  

(iii) Subject to Section 6(f), (A) any Escrow Funds remaining as of the date
that is eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date (the "First Escrow Release
Date") (minus the aggregate amount claimed by the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant
to claims made against such funds in accordance with this Agreement and not
fully resolved prior to such date) that exceed $27,500,000 shall be released
to the Sellers' Representative and (B) any Escrow Funds remaining as of the
date that is two (2) years from the Closing Date (the "Second Escrow Release
Date") (minus the aggregate amount claimed by the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant
to claims made against such funds in accordance with this Agreement and not
fully resolved prior to such date) shall be released to the Sellers'
Representative. At any time following the Second Escrow Release Date, to the
extent the Escrow Funds exceed the aggregate amount claimed by the Buyer
Indemnitees pursuant to claims made prior to such Second Escrow Release Date
and not fully resolved prior to the time of determination, such excess shall,
subject to Section 6(f), be promptly released to the Sellers' Representative.

  

  

(iv) The Sellers' Representative and Buyer shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to make any
distributions from the Escrow Account provided for herein in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(h) Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. For all Tax purposes the
Parties agree to treat any indemnity payment under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price received by Sellers for the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

majority of the issued and outstanding Shares and any attempted assignment
will be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Buyer may

Any Party may send any notice, request, demand, claim or other communication
hereunder to the intended recipient at the address set forth above or on the
Notice Schedule using any other means (including messenger service, telecopy,

in the manner herein set forth.

  

  

(h) Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware (i.e.,
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware). Each of the Parties hereby (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
and agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in any such court, (ii) waives, and agrees not to assert in any
such suit, action or proceeding, any claim that (A) it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of such court or of any other court to which
proceedings in such court may be appealed, (B) such suit, action or proceeding
is brought in an inconvenient forum or (C) the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper, (iii) expressly waives any requirement for the posting
of a bond by the Party bringing such suit, action or proceeding and (iv)
consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by
mailing, certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy thereof to such
Party at the address in effect for notices hereunder, and agrees that such
service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice
thereof. Nothing in this Section 10(h) shall affect or limit any right to
serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

  

  

(i) Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed (i) by
the Buyer and (ii) prior to the Closing, by Sellers holding a majority of the
issued and outstanding Shares and following the Closing, by the Sellers'
Representative. No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation, or
breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder, whether
intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
default, misrepresentation or breach of representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any
prior or subsequent such occurrence.

  

  

(j) Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules. The Exhibits and Schedules
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof.

  

  

(k) Disclosure Schedule. The Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in
paragraphs corresponding to the lettered paragraphs contained in the Sections
of this Agreement; provided, however, that any event, fact or circumstance
disclosed in any lettered paragraph of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to be a disclosure for purposes of each other lettered paragraph of the
Disclosure Schedule to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the face
of such disclosure that it would also qualify such other lettered paragraph.
The inclusion of information in the Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed
as an admission that such information is material to the Company, its
Subsidiaries or the Sellers. Neither the specification of any dollar amount in
any disclosure contained in the Disclosure Schedule nor the inclusion of any
specific item in the Disclosure Schedule is intended to imply that such
amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items,
are or are not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth
of any such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter
not described herein or included in the Disclosure Schedule is or is not
material for purposes of this Agreement. In addition, matters reflected in the
Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be reflected in the Disclosure Schedule. Such additional matters
are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily include
other matters of a similar nature. The inclusion of any specific item in the
Disclosure Schedule is not intended to imply that such item or other item is
or is not in the Ordinary Course of Business, or is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement, and no Party shall use the fact of the inclusion
of any such item in any dispute or controversy among the Parties as to whether
any obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the
Disclosure Schedule is or is not in the Ordinary Course of Business, or is or
is not material for purposes of this Agreement.

(l) Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

(m) Expenses. Each of the Buyer and the Company and its Subsidiaries and each
Seller and Optionholder will bear its own costs and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the
Buyer, any of its Affiliates, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay
any costs or expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred by any
Seller or Optionholder, unless such costs or expenses (including legal fees
and expenses) are included in Company Transaction Expenses. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, shall be shared equally by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Sellers and the Optionholders, on the other hand, when due, and the Buyer, or
when required by Applicable Law, the Sellers' Representative, will, at its own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by Applicable Law, the
Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any
such tax returns and other documentation.

  

  

(n) Construction. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute
or law shall be deemed to refer to such statute or law as extended, amended,
replaced or reenacted from time to time, unless the context requires
otherwise. In addition, any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign
statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.

  

  

(o) Remedies. The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur if
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that there is adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

  

  

(p) Waiver of Conflicts. Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Beauchamps
Solicitors have acted as legal counsel to the Sellers, its Affiliates, the
Sellers' Representative and the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing, and that Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Beauchamps Solicitors intend to act
as legal counsel to the Sellers, the Sellers' Representative and their
Affiliates (which will no longer include the Company and its Subsidiaries)
after the Closing, each of Buyer and the Company hereby waives, on its own
behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may
arise in connection with Kirkland and Ellis LLP or Beauchamps Solicitors
representing the Sellers, the Sellers' Representative or their Affiliates
after the Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated herein.

  

  

(q) Waiver of Jury Trial. Each Party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury
in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party
hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such Party would not, in
the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other Parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual
waiver and certifications in this Section 10(q).
