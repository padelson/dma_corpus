iv AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of November 19, 2015, by and among (i) Liberator Medical Holdings,
Inc., a Nevada corporation (the " _Company_ "), (ii) C. R. Bard, Inc., a New
Jersey corporation (" _Parent_ "), and (iii) Freedom MergerSub, Inc., a Nevada
corporation and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _MergerSub_ "). The
Company, MergerSub and Parent are each sometimes referred to herein
individually as a " _Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_."
Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in _Annex I_.

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent (for itself and as the
sole shareholder of MergerSub) and MergerSub have approved this Agreement and
the Merger, upon the terms of and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger: (i) the Common Stock shall be converted into
the right to receive, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, the Merger Consideration; and (ii) each Option shall be converted into
the right to receive, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, the Option Consideration;

WHEREAS, the Company Board has determined that the form, terms and provisions
of this Agreement are fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and its Shareholders and, in furtherance thereof, has unanimously: (i) adopted
resolutions adopting and approving this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, in all respects for purposes of
Sections 92A.120 and 78.438 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (as amended from
time to time, the "NRS"), (ii) subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, resolved to recommend this Agreement to the Shareholders of the
Company pursuant to Subsection 2(a) of Section 92A.120 of the NRS; and (iii)
received a written opinion of the Financial Advisor as set forth in
Section 2.24(b) herein;

WHEREAS, in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and MergerSub to
enter into this Agreement, holders of certain shares of Common Stock have
entered into voting agreements with the Company, in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Voting Agreements_ ");

WHEREAS, in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and MergerSub to
enter into this Agreement, the persons specified on _Schedule 1_ have entered
into non-competition agreements with the Company, Parent and MergerSub on the
date hereof (collectively, the " _Non-Compete Agreements_ "); and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, and the
mutual promises herein made, and in consideration of the representations,
warranties and covenants herein contained, the Parties hereby agree as
follows: ARTICLE I

 

MERGER; EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; CLOSING

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, in each case, pursuant to the provisions of
the NRS: (a) MergerSub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ "), and the separate corporate existence of MergerSub shall thereupon
cease; and (b) the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
and shall continue to exist as a Subsidiary of Parent. The separate corporate
existence of the Company with all its rights, privileges, powers and
franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The Merger shall have the
effects specified in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and the NRS. From
and after the Effective Time, the Company is sometimes referred to herein as
the " _Surviving Corporation_."

 

1.2 _Articles of Merger_. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the NRS, Parent, MergerSub and the Company shall
cause the articles of merger attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Articles
of Merger_ ") to be filed in accordance with the NRS and shall make all other
filings or recordings as required by applicable Law. The Merger shall be
effective at the time and on the date of the filing of the Articles of Merger
with the Nevada Secretary of State in accordance with the NRS; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, upon the mutual consent of MergerSub, Parent and the
Company, the Articles of Merger may provide for a later date and time of
effectiveness of the Merger not later than ninety (90) days after the date of
the filing of the Articles of Merger (the date and time of the filing of the
Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State, or such later time as
is specified in the Articles of Merger and as agreed to by MergerSub and the
Company, being the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.3 _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in
their entirety to read as the articles of incorporation of MergerSub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall not be amended. 

1.4 _Bylaws_ . At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of
MergerSub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that
the name of the Surviving Corporation shall not be amended.

 

1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of MergerSub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers
of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time and shall hold office until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the
manner provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided by Law, or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

1.6 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_.

(a) _Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder thereof or any Party, each share
of Common Stock

 



2  issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time (other than Common Stock to
be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_) shall be canceled and converted
into the right to receive $3.35 per share in cash (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof, without interest or
dividends, less any applicable withholding Taxes.

 

(b) _Treasury Shares; Parent and MergerSub Shares_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each share of Common Stock held
in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be canceled, retired and cease to exist as of the Effective Time and
no payment shall be made with respect thereto. Each share of Common Stock
owned by Parent or MergerSub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled and extinguished and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(c) _MergerSub Shares_. As of the Effective Time, each share of common stock
of MergerSub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, without any action on the part of MergerSub, be converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Pursuant to NRS 92A.390, no holder of any shares of
Common Stock will have or be entitled to assert dissenters rights or any
other rights of appraisal as a result of or in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

 

1.7 _Equity Awards_.

(a)  _Options_. As of the Effective Time, without any action on the part of
any holder thereof or any Party, each Option that is outstanding and
unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, whether or
not vested, become fully vested and exercisable and shall be canceled, in
each case, in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the Company
Incentive Plan and related award agreements under which such Options were
granted. In consideration of such cancellation, each holder of an Option that
has a per-share exercise price less than the Merger Consideration, if any,
will be entitled to receive in settlement of such Option, a cash payment from
the Surviving Corporation, subject to any required withholding Tax, equal to
the product of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock otherwise
issuable upon the exercise of such Option and (ii) the Merger Consideration
less the applicable exercise price per share of Common Stock of such Option
(the " _Option Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect
to any Person subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, any such amount shall
be paid as soon as practicable after the first date payment can be
made without liability to such Person under Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act. If the exercise price of any Option is equal to or exceeds the Merger
Consideration, then such Option (whether or not vested) shall, to the extent
not exercised prior to the Effective Time, automatically be extinguished and
canceled without the right to receive any consideration (with no payment being
made hereunder with respect thereto).

 

(b) _Payment_. At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
Parent shall otherwise take all steps necessary to cause to be deposited, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, with the Surviving Corporation
for the benefit of the holders of Options, cash in

 



3  an aggregate amount equal to the aggregate Option Consideration payable to
all holders of Options pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_ (the " _Option Fund_
");  _provided_ , _however_ , that any amount withheld pursuant to _Section
1.10_ shall be remitted by the Surviving Corporation to the appropriate Taxing
Authority. The Option Fund shall not be used for any other purpose except
as provided in this Agreement.

1.8 _Payment for Common Stock in the Merger_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint U.S. Bank National
Association to act as exchange and paying agent, registrar and transfer agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") to facilitate the receipt by the Companys
stockholders of the Merger Consideration. At or before the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or Parent shall otherwise take all steps necessary to
cause to be deposited, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in
trust with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common Stock,
cash in an aggregate amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 1.6(a)_ and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the " _Payment Fund_ ").
The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to instructions provided by Parent, make the
payments provided for in _Section 1.6(a)_ out of the Payment Fund (it being
understood that any and all interest earned on funds made available to the
Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent,
except as otherwise provided in _Section 1.8(e)_). The Payment Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose except as provided in this Agreement.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Common
Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form) which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the certificates representing the Common Stock (the _"_ _Certificates_ _"_ )
or uncertificated Common Stock represented by book entry (" _Uncertificated
Shares_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent and (ii)
instructions for use in surrendering such Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares and receiving the Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

 

(c) Upon (i) surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal validly executed and duly completed
in accordance with the instructions thereto or (ii) compliance with the
reasonable procedures established by the Paying Agent for delivery of
Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares shall be entitled to receive, in exchange therefor (other than Common
Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_), cash in an amount equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, as applicable, and
(ii) the Merger Consideration, which amount shall be paid by the Paying Agent
in accordance with the instructions provided by such holder as set forth in
such holders letter of transmittal. No interest or dividends will be paid or
accrued on the consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate or
transfer of any Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of the applicable
Common Stock may be made to a Person (other than the Person in whose name the

 



4  Certificate surrendered or the Uncertificated Shares so transferred is
registered) if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Shares shall be properly
transferred. The Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect thereof or such Person shall establish to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 1.8_, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share
(other than those representing Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 1.6(b)_) shall represent, for all purposes, only the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares, as applicable and (ii) the Merger Consideration, without any interest
or dividends thereon.

 

(d) The consideration issued upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with this Agreement shall be deemed to
have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Common
Stock formerly represented thereby, subject, however, to the Surviving
Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions,
in each case with a record date (i) after the date of this Agreement but
prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company
on such shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
or (ii) on or prior to the date of this Agreement, and in each case, which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, there shall be
no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of any
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this _Article I_.

 

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any amounts that may be payable
to the former Shareholders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement)
that remains unclaimed by the former Shareholders upon the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing Date shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation
upon demand by the Surviving Corporation to the Paying Agent and any
former Shareholders who have not theretofore complied with this _Article I_
shall thereafter look, subject to _Section 1.8(f)_, to the Surviving
Corporation only as general unsecured creditors thereof for payment of any
Merger Consideration, without any interest or dividends thereon, that may be
payable in respect of each share of Common Stock held by such Shareholder.
Following the Closing, the Paying Agent shall retain the right to invest and
reinvest the Payment Fund, on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, in
securities listed or guaranteed by the United States government or as
otherwise directed by the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation
shall receive the interest earned thereon. Nothing contained in
this Agreement and no investment losses resulting from the investment of the
Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any Shareholder to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. If for any reason
(including investment losses) the Payment Fund is at any time or from time to
time inadequate to pay the amounts to which Shareholders shall be entitled
under _Section 1.6(a)_, then (i) any interest described in this _Section
1.8(e)_ shall not be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation but instead
shall be used to cover any such shortfall and (ii) Parent shall take all steps
necessary to, and shall enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to,
deposit in trust additional cash with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all
payments required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall in any event be liable for the payment thereof.

 



5 (f) None of Parent, MergerSub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable
to a holder of Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or any other Person in
respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have
been surrendered or any Uncertificated Shares shall not have been transferred
by the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date (or immediately prior to
such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration, dividends (whether in
cash, stock or property) or other distributions with respect to Common Stock
in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Body), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all Legal Proceedings or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation) of that fact by the Person (who shall be the record
owner of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct as indemnity against any Legal
Proceeding that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article I_.

 

1.9 _Holders of Certificates_. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of Certificates, Uncertificated Shares and Option award agreements shall
cease to have any rights with respect to the Common Stock, or Options
represented thereby, other than the right to receive any amounts provided in
_Section 1.6_, _Section 1.7_ and _Section 1.8_.

 

1.10 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
each of the Paying Agent, Parent, MergerSub and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payments otherwise payable
to any Securityholder pursuant to this Agreement, such amount as the Paying
Agent, Parent, MergerSub and the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to such payment under the Code, or any other
applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such former Securityholder in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

1.11 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of shares of Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the

10  Except as set forth in _Section 2.7_ of the Disclosure Letter, such SEC
Reports (i) were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and the published rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, each as
applicable to such SEC Reports and (ii) did not contain as of the time they

state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

unresolved comments issued by the staff of the SEC with respect to any of the

at the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated
therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of

information (both financial and non-financial) relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries required to be disclosed by the Company in the SEC Reports
is accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. The
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the Companys auditors
and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies
in the design or operation of internal controls which could adversely affect
the Companys ability to properly record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for the Companys auditors any material
weaknesses in internal controls and (ii) any fraud or suspected fraud, whether
or not material, that involves management, employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal

 



11  control over financial reporting or others where the fraud could have a
material effect on the financial statements contained in the SEC Reports, or
that was received in communication from employees, former employees,
regulators or others.

(e) The management of the Company has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in

the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, and such assessment concluded that
such controls were effective. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
facts or circumstances that would prevent the Companys principal executive
officer and principal financial officer from giving the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next

of the staff of the SEC relating to the SEC Reports, and the SEC has
not asserted that any of such responses are inadequate, insufficient or
otherwise non-responsive. The Company has delivered or made available to
Parent true, correct and complete copies of all correspondence with the SEC
occurring since October 1, 2012.

(g) The audit committee of the Company Board has established " _whistleblower_
" procedures that meet the requirements of Exchange Act Rule 10A-3, and the
Company has made available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of such
procedures. No complaint seeking relief under Section 806 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act has been filed with the United States Secretary of Labor and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, no employee has threatened to file any such
complaint.

contracts other than with respect to the breach thereof, (iii) that were

promptly inform the other Parties of any material communications with any
Governmental Antitrust Entity regarding any such filings or the Merger.
Subject to applicable Law and the terms hereof, the Parties will consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of
any Party relating to proceedings under the HSR Act and/or responding to
requests or objections made by any Governmental Antitrust Entity. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, but subject to the terms
hereof, unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Antitrust Entity, the Parties hereto agree to (i) give each other reasonable
advance notice of all meetings with any Governmental Antitrust Entity relating

Entity regarding this Agreement. Any such disclosures or provisions of

the extent required under applicable Law or as appropriate to protect
confidential business information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
materials furnished by Parent or the Company to the other party pursuant to
this _Section 4.1_ may be redacted to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company or as Parent or the Company, as applicable,
determines in good faith is necessary to comply with applicable Law or to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege concerns. In addition
to, and not in limitation of, the foregoing, a Party may request entry into a
joint defense or similar agreement as a condition to providing disclosure or
materials not provided to such Party pursuant to the two preceding sentences
and that, upon receipt of that request, the Parties shall work in good faith
to enter into a joint defense agreement or other similar arrangement to create
and preserve attorney-client privilege or to address other concerns in order
to provide such Party with such information in a form and substance mutually
acceptable to the Parties.

4.1_, the Parties shall provide or cause to be provided as promptly as
practicable to any Governmental

 



33  Antitrust Entity information and documents requested by any Governmental
Antitrust Entity or necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of
the Merger, including filing no later than ten (10) Business Days after the
date hereof, of any notification and report form and related material required
under the HSR Act by Parent and the Company and thereafter to respond promptly
to any request for additional information or documentary material that may be

use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Antitrust Entity with respect to the Merger
under any Competition Law or any other applicable Law. Each of Parent, the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall use its reasonable best efforts to take
such action as may be required to cause the timely expiration or early
termination of the notice periods under the HSR Act with respect to the
Merger as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement. In
connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging the Merger as violative of any Competition Laws,
each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts
to contest any such Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed,
or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the
Merger, including by pursuing available avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal unless Parent and the Company mutually conclude that litigation is
not in their respective best interests or, in the case of any permanent
Order, Parent concludes and has notified the Company in writing that an appeal
is more likely than not to be unsuccessful. Parent shall be responsible for
one hundred percent (100%) of the fees associated with the filing of the
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act.

(c) For the purposes of this _Section 4.1_, "reasonable best efforts" of
Parent shall not require (nor shall anything in this _Section 4.1_ or
otherwise in this Agreement require) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take
any action that would prohibit or limit in any respect, or place any
conditions on, the ownership or operation by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the
Company or its Subsidiaries of any portion of the business or assets of Parent
or the Company, or their respective Subsidiaries, or compel Parent or the
Company, or their respective Subsidiaries, to dispose of, hold separate or
license any portion of the business, assets or Intellectual Property of Parent
or the Company, or their respective Subsidiaries, respectively, in each case
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents.

(d) In addition, with regard to any Governmental Antitrust Entity, none of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its Related Persons shall,
without Parents prior written consent in Parents sole discretion, discuss or
commit to any divestiture transaction, or discuss or commit to alter their
businesses or commercial practices in any way, or otherwise discuss, take or
commit to take any action that limits Parents freedom of action with respect
to, or Parents ability to retain any of their respective businesses, product
lines or assets or otherwise receive the full benefits of this Agreement.

4.2 _Access to Books and Records_. From the date hereof until the earlier of
the Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VI_

MergerSub and their authorized Representatives, upon reasonable notice, with

personnel, books, commitments, contracts and records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and shall instruct

as reasonably necessary in order for Parent and MergerSub to have the
opportunity to make such investigation as they shall reasonably desire to
make of the Business, affairs and properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the activities of Parent,
MergerSub and Parent and MergerSubs Representatives shall be conducted in a
manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the Business;
and (b) furnish to Parent, MergerSub and their respective Representatives such
additional information as Parent, MergerSub and their
respective Representatives may reasonably request from time-to-time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to provide
such access or information if the Company determines, in its reasonable
judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or jeopardize
protections afforded to the Company or any Subsidiary under the attorney
client privilege or attorney work product doctrine; _provided_ , _however_ ,
the Company shall work together with Parent and MergerSub in good faith to
provide, pursuant to alternative arrangements including entry into a joint
defense or other similar arrangement agreed upon by the Parties, such access
or information. Except as otherwise agreed to by the Company, and
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, the terms and provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of February 15, 2015, between
Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall apply to
all information furnished to any of Parent and MergerSubs authorized
Representatives by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No investigation
pursuant to this _Section 4.2_ or information provided, made available or
delivered to Parent, MergerSub or any of Parent or MergerSubs authorized
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 4.2_ shall affect any
representations, warranties, covenants, conditions, remedies or rights of the
Parties hereto contained in this Agreement.

limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as set forth in _Section
4.3_ of the Disclosure Letter, during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, without the prior written

Thereafter, each Party hereby agrees to (a) consult promptly with each other
Party prior to issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement with respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this

to the requirements set forth in _Section 4.9_, other than with respect to

release or statement (other than any filing with the SEC, which shall solely
be subject to the requirements set forth in _Section 4.9_, other than with
respect to any press release or other public announcement attached as an
exhibit thereto). Neither Party shall issue any such press release or make
any such public statement prior to such consultation and review by the other

reasonable efforts to allow the second Party reasonable time to review and
comment on such release or statement in advance of such issuance.

 



38 ---|--- 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide each employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and who remains employed immediately
after the Closing (each such employee, a " _Continuing Employee_ "), subject
to his or her continued employment, with a level of compensation (such term to
include salary, bonus opportunities, and commissions, but excluding equity-
based compensation) that is no less favorable than that provided by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing. During
the Continuation Period, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide the Continuing Employees with retirement and welfare benefits that
are no less favorable than those provided by the Company (including
participant costs).

 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or its
Subsidiaries including the Surviving Corporation (collectively, " _Parent
Benefit Plans_ ") in which any Continuing Employees will participate following
the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary to,
recognize all service of the Continuing Employees with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be as if such service were with Parent, for
vesting, eligibility and vacation entitlement purposes (but not benefit
accruals) in any Parent Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employees may be
eligible to participate after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that (i) such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits or (ii) such service was not recognized
under the corresponding Employee Plan.

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for
purposes of each Parent Benefit Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee or any other
Parent Benefit Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA), Parent shall cause, or with respect to any such plan that is
fully insured, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each third-
party insurer to: (i) waive all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Benefit Plan for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable Employee Plan in which such employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing; and (ii) cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year of the Employee Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding Parent Benefit Plan begins to be
taken into account under such Parent Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent Benefit Plan.

(d) This _Section 4.5_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 4.5_,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person, including Continuing
Employees, any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this _Section 4.5_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall
be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
terms set forth in this 

 



39   _Section 4.5_ shall not create any right in any employee or any other
Person to any continued employment with the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

4.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Company shall give notice to Parent, and Parent shall give notice to the
Company, as promptly as reasonably practicable, upon becoming aware of (a) any
fact, change, condition, circumstance, event, occurrence or non-occurrence
that has caused, or is reasonably likely to cause, any representation or
warranty in this Agreement made by the Company, Parent or MergerSub, as the
case may be, to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect, such that the
conditions set forth in _Section 5.1(a)_ or _Section 5.2(a)_, as applicable,
would not be satisfied on or before the Termination Date; (b) any failure of
the Company, Parent or MergerSub to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, in
each case such that the conditions set forth in _Section 5.1(b)_ or _Section
5.2(b)_, as applicable, would not be satisfied on or before the Termination
Date; or (c) the institution of or the written threat of institution of any
Legal Proceeding against it related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 4.6_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice, or the
representations or warranties of, or the conditions to the obligations of, the
Parties hereto and thereto.

4.7 _Further Assurances_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Parties shall
cooperate with each other and use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to
appropriate confidentiality protections and  _Section 4.1_, during the Pre-
Closing Period, each Party shall furnish to the other Parties such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other Party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to  _Section 4.1_, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Parent, MergerSub and the
Company: (a) shall make all filings and give all notices reasonably required
to be made and given by such Party in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (b) shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all third-party consents required in
connection with the Merger, but the failure of a third-party to issue any such
consent shall not be a breach of this Agreement.

4.8 _Payoff of Company Indebtedness_. In the event that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has Indebtedness described in clause (a) of the definition
thereof outstanding as of the Closing, the Company will deliver to Parent, not
later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, payoff letters
(the " _Payoff Letters_ ") from each of the Company Creditors specified in
_Section 4.8_ of the Disclosure Letter with respect to the Indebtedness in
_Section 4.8_ of the Disclosure Letter, which letters shall specify: (a) the
aggregate amount required to be paid in order to repay in full the Company
Indebtedness related to such Payoff Letter (including any and all accrued but
unpaid interest and prepayment penalty obligations due upon repayment); (b)
payment instructions on the projected Closing Date, as well as the per diem
amount to be added thereto in the event that the actual Closing Date is a date
subsequent to the projected Closing Date; and (c) wire instructions of
the Companys accounts to make such payoff from the Companys accounts. Each
such Payoff Letter shall include customary undertakings to release in full,
upon payment of the amounts set forth in such Payoff Letters, all Liens
securing the 

 



40  Company Indebtedness related to such Payoff Letter and to promptly prepare
and file with the appropriate Governmental Body such instruments as may be
required to effect or evidence such release or shall include authorization
for the Company or another party designated by the Company to prepare and file
any such instruments.

4.9  _Shareholder Approval; Preparation of Proxy Statement_.

(a) The Company Board has declared this Agreement, the Company Documents
and the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
advisable and adopted a resolution recommending approval of this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by the

(b) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall take all actions in
accordance with applicable Law and the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws,
to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its
Shareholders (the " _Company Shareholder Meeting_ ") as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the clearance by the SEC of the Proxy Statement (or, if
the staff of the SEC has not informed the Company that it intends to review
the Proxy Statement, duly call and give notice of the Company Shareholder
Meeting no later than the first date following the tenth (10th) calendar day
following the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement) for the purpose of
considering and voting upon the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and
such other matters as may be necessary to effectuate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company shall deliver to the
Shareholders: (i) the Proxy Statement; and (ii) any other notice and

opportunity to review and comment on each of the documents to be mailed or
delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this _Section 4.9(b)_ and which are not
attached as Exhibits to this Agreement, and the Company shall consider in good
faith all such comments. Subject to  _Section 4.11(c)_ and _Section
6.1(g)_, the Company Board shall (A) recommend to the Shareholders the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger, (B) include in the Proxy Statement
such recommendation of the Company Board that the Shareholders vote in favor
of the approval of this Agreement, (C) use all reasonable best efforts to
solicit such approval from the Shareholders and (D) not withdraw or modify
such Board Recommendation. The Proxy Statement shall include a copy of the
Fairness Opinion and (subject to _Section 4.11(c)_ hereof) the Board
Recommendation. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
_Section 6.1_, the Company shall submit this Agreement and the Merger to its
Shareholders at the Company Shareholder Meeting. For purposes of clarity, in
no event shall the Company be required to hold the Company Shareholder Meeting
or prepare or mail the Proxy Statement if an Adverse Recommendation has
occurred.

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, and in connection with the Company Shareholder Meeting, the
Company shall (i) prepare and, after prior review and approval by Parent and
MergerSub (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), file with
the SEC, use its commercially reasonable efforts to have cleared by the SEC

4.9(b)_ and _Section 4.11(c)_, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the necessary approvals by the Shareholders of this Agreement and the
Merger and (v) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply
with all legal requirements applicable to the Company Shareholder Meeting. If
at any time prior to the Effective Time any information should be discovered
by any Party hereto which should be set forth in a supplement or amendment to
the Proxy Statement in order to ensure that the Proxy Statement would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other Parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to
the Shareholders.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholder Meeting (i) if, on
the basis of advice of outside counsel, it is necessary to do so in order to
ensure that any information discovered by any Party hereto that should be set
forth in a supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, is provided to the Shareholders, (ii) if as of the
time for which the Company Shareholder Meeting is originally scheduled there
are insufficient shares of Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be
conducted at the Company Shareholder Meeting or (iii) if otherwise required
under applicable Law, including NRS 92A.120; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in
any case, other than with respect to adjournments or postponements under
clause (iii), any such adjournment or postponement of the Company Shareholder
Meeting shall not exceed, without the prior written approval of Parent in its
sole discretion, the earlier of (i) the last day before which it would be
necessary under applicable Law to establish another record date to vote at the
Company Shareholder Meeting, and (ii) the first Business Day following the
twentieth (20th) calendar day of the initially scheduled Company Shareholder
Meeting.

4.10 _Company Action_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all actions necessary and sufficient in accordance with applicable Law, the
Company Incentive Plan and, as applicable, the terms of each Option award
agreement (including delivering all required notices and passing necessary
resolutions of the Company Board and any applicable committee thereof), in
each case, to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including this _Section 4.10_). Without limiting the foregoing, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to 

 



42  ensure that the Company will not, at the Effective Time, be bound by any
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock rights, restricted stock
units, phantom equity awards, warrants or other rights or agreements which
would entitle any Person, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to own any
equity interest in the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in
respect thereof. The Company shall take all actions necessary and sufficient
to terminate the Company Incentive Plan, such termination to be effective at
the Effective Time. The Company does not maintain a 401(k) or similar savings
plan.

 

4.11 _No Solicitation or Negotiation_.

 

(a) The Company acknowledges that neither it, nor any of its Company
Representatives, are engaged in any discussions or negotiations with
any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and confirms that it has
complied with, and is in current compliance with, its standstill obligations
as set forth in the Exclusivity Letter. Except as otherwise permitted by
this  _Section 4.11_, the Company shall not, and shall not authorize or
permit its Company Representatives to, directly or indirectly, from the date
hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VI_ : (i) solicit,
initiate, facilitate or encourage the making of an Acquisition Proposal; or
(ii) (A) furnish or disclose to any Person non-public information with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal; (B) negotiate or engage in discussions with any
Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; or (C) enter into or amend or
grant any waiver or release under any Contract (whether or not binding) or
agreement in principle with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

(b) Except as otherwise permitted by this _Section 4.11_ or unless the
cancellation of, or removal of this Agreement from consideration at, the
Company Shareholder Meeting is mandated by NRS 92A.120, the Company Board
shall not: (i) withdraw, amend, modify or qualify, or publicly propose to
withdraw, amend, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or
MergerSub, its Board Recommendation; (ii) approve, recommend, or fail to
recommend against, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) make any public statement inconsistent with
its recommendation that the Shareholders approve this Agreement and the
Merger; (iv) fail to include its Board Recommendation to the Shareholders in
the Proxy Statement; or (v) enter into any Contract (whether or not binding)
or agreement in principle with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (any of
the foregoing listed in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), an " _Adverse
Recommendation_ " and (v), an " _Adverse Acquisition Agreement_ ").

 

(c) Notwithstanding _Sections 4.11(a)_ and _4.11(b)_ , prior to the receipt of
the Required Approval, including during a Fiduciary Out Notice Period, the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through any Representative, may, but
subject to _Sections 4.11(d)_ and _4.11(e)_ : (i) participate in negotiations
or discussions with any third-party that has made (and not withdrawn) a bona
fide and unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that did not result from violation
of this _Section 4.11_ and that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal (a " _Qualified Acquisition Proposal_ "); (ii) thereafter
furnish to such third party non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an executed confidentiality agreement
containing terms no less favorable to the Company, in the aggregate, as
reasonably determined by the Company, than those set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that each such confidentiality agreement
will permit the sharing of information by the 

 



43  Company to Parent as contemplated by this Agreement (a copy of such
confidentiality agreement shall be promptly provided to Parent (in all events
within thirty-six (36) hours)); (iii) following receipt of and on account of
a Qualified Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good
faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor
constitutes a Superior Proposal, make an Adverse Recommendation and/or enter
into an Adverse Acquisition Agreement; and/or (iv) take any action that any
court of competent jurisdiction orders the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to take (which order remains unstayed), but in each case referred to in the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), only if the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, which shall be deemed
to include its obligations under NRS 92A.120.

 

(d) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clauses
(i) through (iv) of _Section 4.11(c)_ unless the Company complies with the
provisions of this _Section 4.11(d)_. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly (but in no event later than thirty-six (36) hours) after the receipt
by the Company (or any Company Representative) of any Acquisition Proposal,
any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, any request for non-public information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
third-party, in each case, in connection with an Acquisition Proposal. In such
notice, the Company shall: (i) identify the third-party making the Acquisition
Proposal and (ii) provide a summary of the material terms and conditions of
the Acquisition Proposal, or indication or request. The Company shall notify
Parent as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within thirty-six
(36) hours) of any changes to the material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request, including any material amendments or proposed
amendments as to price and other material terms thereof. The Company shall
promptly provide Parent (and in no event later than thirty-six (36) hours
after such information is provided to them) with copies of any non-public
information concerning the Business and the Companys present or future
performance, financial condition or results of operations, provided to any
third party, to the extent such information has not been previously provided
to Parent.

(e) Notwithstanding  _Section 4.11(b)_, at any time prior to the receipt of
the Required Approval, the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1(g)_ in order to enter into
an Adverse Acquisition Agreement, if: (i) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
financial advisor that a Qualified Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least
four (4) Business Days (the " _Fiduciary Out Notice Period_ ") before taking
such action of its intention to take such action with respect to the
Qualified Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall state expressly that the
Company has received a Qualified Acquisition Proposal that the Board has
determined constitutes a Superior Proposal and that the Company Board intends
to make an Adverse Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 6.1(g)_; (iii) the Company attaches to such notice the most current
version of the proposed agreement with respect to (which version shall be
updated on a prompt basis), and the identity of the third-party making, such
Qualified Acquisition Proposal; (iv) the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
its Subsidiaries 

 



44  Representatives to, during the Fiduciary Out Notice Period, negotiate with
Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Qualified Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make
such adjustments (it being agreed that in the event that, after commencement
of the Fiduciary Out Notice Period, there is any material revision to the
terms of the Qualified Acquisition Proposal, including, any revision in price,
the Fiduciary Out Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure
that at least two (2) Business Days remains in the Fiduciary Out
Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such
material revision (it being understood that there may be multiple
extensions)); and (v) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consulting with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that in the
case of a Qualified Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments
made by Parent during the Fiduciary Out Notice Period in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including pursuant to clause (e)(iv) of this
_Section 4.11_. During the Fiduciary Out Notice Period, the Company shall be
permitted to take the actions set forth in _Sections 4.11(c)(i)_ and _(ii)_
in respect of the Person that submitted such Qualified Acquisition Proposal.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.11_ shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under applicable Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal, including talking and disclosing to its Shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) complying with its disclosure
obligations if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to disclose would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law or (iii)
making accurate disclosure to the Shareholders of any factual information
regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 4.11(f)_ shall permit the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation
(including in compliance with Rule 14e-2, Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or other applicable Law)
without complying with _Sections 4.11(d)_ and _4.11(e)_ and, for the
avoidance of doubt, any such disclosure described in clauses (i) and (ii) that
does not reaffirm the Board Recommendation (other than a "stop, look and
listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall constitute an Adverse
Recommendation.

4.12 _Directors  and Officers Liability Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, pursuant to the
provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, in each case, as in
effect on the date hereof, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present
and former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time while such
persons are officers and directors to the same extent as is provided under the
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect on the date of this
Agreement. For a period of six (6) years following the Closing Date, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will amend, repeal or modify such
provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws in any manner that
would adversely affect in any material respect the rights thereunder of such
persons; _provided_ ,

 



45   _however,_ that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation
imposed from time-to-time under applicable Law. The Company shall, during the
Pre-Closing Period, provide for advancement of expenses of the Persons
serving as officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries at any
time during the Pre-Closing Period, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Person to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined by
a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Surviving Corporation as authorized which shall be, in any
event, at least as favorable to such persons as the advancement of expenses
of the officers and directors of MergerSub as set forth in the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of MergerSub as in effect on the date hereof. The
Surviving Corporation shall assume and comply with, and shall not terminate,
modify or amend in any way that is less favorable or adverse to any or all of
the counterparties thereto, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to assume and comply with, and not to terminate, modify or amend
in any way that is less favorable or adverse to any or all of the
counterparties thereto, the Director Indemnification Agreements. To the extent
that this _Section 4.12(a)_ conflicts with any section of any Director
Indemnification Agreement, the Director Indemnification Agreement shall
control to the extent of such conflict.

(b) At Parents sole expense, at or prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall procure, and for a period of six (6) years following the
Closing Date, Parent shall maintain, or cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain, directors and officers liability insurance coverage, which shall
provide for policy limits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of
coverage at least as favorable in the aggregate to the directors and officers
covered under such insurance policies as the policy limits, terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage in the existing policies of the Company,
and which shall provide full prior acts coverage for alleged wrongful acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, for any current or
former officers and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any actions or omissions by such directors or officers occurring
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such insurance
policies are not available at an annual cost not greater than two hundred
fifty percent (250%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof
under such policy (the " _Insurance Cap_ "), then the Company shall obtain, at
Parents sole expense, as much comparable insurance as can reasonably be
obtained in the Companys good faith judgment at a cost up to but not
exceeding the Insurance Cap. Following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
shall, or Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or its successor)
to, maintain the insurance purchased by the Company pursuant to this _Section
4.12(b)_ in effect for the entire six (6) year policy period required by this
_Section 4.12(b)_.

 

(c) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns, in one or more transactions, (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties, rights and other assets to any one or
more Persons, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall be
responsible for the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this
_Section 4.12_. Such assumption shall be a condition precedent to the
Surviving Corporation taking any such action.

(d) The obligations set forth in this  _Section 4.12_ shall not be
terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects
any Person described in this __

 



46   _Section 4.12_ (or any other Person who is a beneficiary under the
directors and officers liability insurance or the policy referred to in
_Section 4.12(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior
written consent of such affected Person.

(e) The provisions of this  _Section 4.12_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are expressly intended to benefit each of the present and former
officers and directors of the Company (or their respective heirs or
representatives) up to the Effective Time who are entitled to indemnification
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement.

4.13 _Notice or Demand for Fair Value of Common Stock_. The Company shall
give Parent prompt written notice upon receipt by the Company at any time
before the Effective Time of any purported notice of intent to demand, or any
purported demand in respect of, payment of the fair value of any shares of
Common Stock under the NRS or otherwise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any withdrawal of any such purported notice
or demand. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, negotiate, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand at any time before the Effective Time, and prior to
the Effective Time, Parent and MergerSub shall have the right to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such purported
demand.

4.14 _Termination of Registration_. Each of the Parties hereto agrees to
cooperate with the other Party in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions
and to do or causing to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to terminate the registration of the Common Stock under the
Exchange Act and to cause the delisting of the Common Stock from NYSE;
_provided_ that such termination and delisting shall not be effective until or
after the Effective Time.

 

4.15 _Shareholder Litigation_. Without limiting _Section 4.13_, the Company
shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any Legal Proceeding brought by
any Shareholder against the Company and/or its directors or officers and shall
promptly provide Parent with copies of all proceedings and third party
correspondence relating to such Legal Proceeding. Each of the Parties hereto
shall give the others the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense
of any Shareholder Legal Proceeding against the Company, Parent or MergerSub,
as applicable, and their respective directors or officers relating to the
Merger or the transactions contemplated under this Agreement and the Parties
shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to contest any such Shareholder
Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any
Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Merger in
connection with any Shareholder Legal Proceeding, including by pursuing
available avenues of judicial appeal. The Company shall not settle any Legal
Proceeding currently pending, or commenced after the date of this Agreement,
against the Company or any of its directors or officers by any Securityholder
relating to this Agreement or the Merger, in each case, without the
prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Company requests that Parent provide
its consent to a settlement of any Shareholder Legal Proceeding agreed to by
the Company and the plaintiffs to any such Shareholder Legal Proceeding, but
Parent unreasonably withholds such consent, and thereafter a permanent Order
relating to such Shareholder Legal Proceeding is imposed that prevents the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and this Agreement is
then terminated, Parent shall reimburse the Company for any third party fees
and expenses it incurs in connection with defending any such Shareholder Legal
Proceeding.

 



47 4.16 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary and permitted to cause the
Merger or the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including any
dispositions of Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
such Common Stock and including the deemed disposition and cancellation of
the Options in the Merger) by each individual who is or will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.

4.17 _State Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Law is or may become
applicable to the Merger or the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement, (a) the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Merger or the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and (b) the Company Board
shall timely take all commercially reasonable actions within its power (and
with respect to NRS 78.411 through 78.444, inclusive, all actions within its
power) necessary to render such statutes inapplicable to the Merger or the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor MergerSub shall knowingly take any action that would
reasonably be expected to render it an interested stockholder of the Company
pursuant to any Takeover Law other than any Takeover Law under the NRS.

 

4.18 _SEC Reports_. From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the
Company shall timely file with the SEC all SEC Reports required to be filed
by it under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. As of its filing date, or
if amended after the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such
amendment, each such SEC Report shall comply in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the
case may be. As of its filing date or, if amended after the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, each such SEC Report
filed pursuant to the Exchange Act shall not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each such SEC
Report that is a registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if
applicable, filed after the date of this Agreement pursuant to the Securities
Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became effective
after the date of this Agreement, shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

4.19 _Officer and Director Resignations_. The Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain written resignations, effective
as of the Closing, from each of the persons set forth in _Section 4.19_ of
the Disclosure Letter, in each case, in his or her capacity as an officer or a
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Closing shall not have occurred by 11:59 pm Eastern time on such date,
_provided_ , _however_ , that the terminating Party is not in breach in any
material respect of any of its obligations hereunder that has been the cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Termination Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Termination Date shall be
extended at either Parents or the Companys option, by notice to the other,
until June 30, 2016 if all conditions to Closing have been satisfied or waived
(other than those that are to be satisfied by action taken at Closing) other

(e) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have
become untrue, in each case such that the conditions set forth in _Sections
5.1_  and _5.3_ would not be satisfied and such breach is incapable of being
cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty
(30) days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach
from Parent stating its intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 6.1(e)_ and this Agreement shall terminate without further
action, notice or deed, on the thirty-first (31st) day after delivery of

 



51  such notice if such breach or failure has not been so cured; _provided_ that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.1(e)_ shall
not be available to Parent if Parent or MergerSub is then in material breach
of this Agreement;

(f) by the Company, if Parent or MergerSub shall have breached or failed to

the conditions set forth in _Sections 5.2_ and _5.3_ would not be satisfied
and such breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured,

this Agreement shall terminate without further action, notice or deed, on the
thirty-first (31st) day after delivery of such notice if such breach or
failure has not been so cured; _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 6.1(f)_ shall not be available to the
Company if the Company is then in material breach of this Agreement;

(g) by the Company, at any time prior to obtaining the Required Approval, if
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) authorizes the Company to enter
into an Adverse Acquisition Agreement concerning a transaction that
constitutes a Superior Proposal and the Company enters into such Adverse
Acquisition Agreement concurrently with such termination, but only if (x) the
Company has complied with _Section 4.11_ (subject to the applicable cure in
_Section 6.2_) and  _Section 6.2_ and (y) as a condition to the
effectiveness of such termination, the Company pays the Termination Fee to
Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds;

 

(h) by the Company or Parent, if a permanent injunction or other Order which

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.1(h)_ shall
have complied with _Section 4.1_ or _Section 4.15_, as applicable.

6.2 _Effect of Termination_. Any Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 6.1_ shall give written notice of such termination to the other
Party in accordance with this Agreement specifying the provision or provisions
of Article VI pursuant to which such termination is being effected and the
basis therefor and such termination shall be effective upon the transmission
of such notice to the other Party (unless a later effective time is specified
in such notice) and compliance with such provisions. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in order to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
6.1(g)_, the Company shall send written notice of intention to terminate (the
" _Section 6.1(g) Notice_ ") to Parent (which transmission shall not
trigger payment of the Termination Fee) which Section 6.1(g) Notice and the
termination contemplated thereby shall become automatically effective without
any further notice at the expiration of the forty-eight (48) hour period
immediately following transmission thereof (the " _Section 6.1(g) Notice
Period_ "), subject only to payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 6.1(g)(y)_ and the entry into the Adverse Acquisition Agreement
described in  _Section 6.1(g)_ concurrently with payment to Parent of the
Termination Fee, unless:

(a) during the Section 6.1(g) Notice Period, Parent delivers to the Company a
written notice indicating that the Company is in compliance with _Section
4.11_, in which case the

 



52  Section 6.1(g) Notice and the termination contemplated thereby shall become
effective automatically upon the Companys receipt of such notice from Parent
and payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 6.1(g)(y)_ and the
entry into such Adverse Acquisition Agreement concurrently with payment to
Parent of the Termination Fee; or

 

(b) during the Section 6.1(g) Notice Period, Parent delivers to the Company a
written notice describing any non-compliance with or breach by the Company of
_Section 4.11(d)_, then the Company shall have the opportunity to cure such
non-compliance or breach during the forty-eight (48) hour period immediately
following the Companys receipt of such notice from Parent, and if the
Company cures such non-compliance or breach during such period (and Company
agrees to provide written notice to Parent of such cure), then the Fiduciary
Out Notice Period shall be automatically extended for an additional two (2)
Business Days and the Parties shall once again comply with the provisions of
_Section 4.11(e)_ with respect to such Fiduciary Out Notice Period and if,
upon the expiration of the Fiduciary Out Notice Period, as extended,
the applicable Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent during such
Fiduciary Out Notice Period, then this Agreement shall be deemed to be
terminated subject only to payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 6.1(g)(y)_ and the entry into such Adverse Acquisition Agreement
concurrently with payment to Parent of the Termination Fee. For the avoidance
of doubt, in the event that any non-compliance with or breach by the Company
of _Section 4.11(d)_ identified by Parent is not cured in accordance with
this Section 6.2(b), then the Company shall have no right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 6.1(g)_ with respect to such Superior
Proposal.

In the event that the effectiveness of any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to a Section 6.1(g) Notice falls on a day that is not a Business Day,
then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 6.1(g)_,
such termination shall nevertheless be effective on such day and the
Termination Fee shall be payable by the Company on the first Business Day
following the effectiveness thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in no event shall delivery of a Section 6.1(g)
Notice constitute an Adverse Recommendation. In the event of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1_, all obligations under this
Agreement (other than those provisions set forth in this _Article VI_ and
_Article VII_ and the penultimate sentence of _Section 4.2_) shall terminate
and shall be of no further force or effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
Party to this Agreement may seek to recover damages in the event of a
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.1_ as result of a
willful breach of this Agreement by another Party prior to the termination of
this Agreement.

 

6.3 _Fees and Expenses Following Termination_.

 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to:

 

(i) _Section 6.1(b)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer
of immediately available funds), within two (2) Business Days after such
termination, a fee in an amount equal to the Termination Fee, unless, prior to
the receipt of the Termination Fee, Parent has commenced an action for or
otherwise seeks an injunction or order of specific performance requiring the
consummation of the Merger, in which case, no Termination Fee shall be payable
during the pendency of such proceeding, but shall be paid to Parent within one
(1) Business Day of any Order denying Parents request for an injunction or
order of specific performance;

 



53 (ii) _Section 6.1(c)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds), within two (2) Business Days
following receipt by the Company of documentation relating to Parents and
MergerSubs fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, an amount equal to all such fees and
expenses up to a maximum of $2,000,000; or

(iii)  _Section 6.1(c)_, _Section 6.1(d)_ (provided that such termination
pursuant to _Section 6.1(d)_ does not occur at a time when termination could
have occurred pursuant to _Section 6.1(h)_) or  _Section 6.1(e)_ and (A) at
or prior to the time of termination of this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal
(which, for purposes of this Section 6.2(a)(iii) shall have the meaning set
forth in the definition of Acquisition Proposal contained in Annex I, except
that all references to "fifteen percent (15%) or more" shall be deemed
references to "more than fifty percent (50%)") shall have been made; and (B)
on or before the twelve (12) month anniversary of the date of termination of
this Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive Adverse Acquisition
Agreement with any third-party other than Parent or its Affiliates (whether or
not with the same party which made the Acquisition Proposal), then the
Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds),
within two (2) Business Days after the date upon which the transaction
contemplated by such definitive Adverse Acquisition Agreement is consummated,
a fee in an amount equal to the Termination Fee less any amount previously
paid to Parent under Section 6.3(a)(ii).

 

(b) The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that the provisions of _Section
6.1(g)_ and this _Section 6.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), and that, without such
provisions, Parent and MergerSub would not have entered into this Agreement.
If the Company shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant
to _Section 6.1(g)_ and this _Section 6.3_, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent makes a claim against the Company that results in a judgment
against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent the costs and expenses
of Parent (including its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred or
accrued in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts
set forth in this _Section 6.3_ at the prime lending rate prevailing during
such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_. Any interest payable
hereunder shall be calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were
required to be paid until (but excluding) the date of actual payment, and on
the basis of a 360-day year. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no
event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and

and (ii) any proposal to adjourn any Company Shareholder Meeting so long as
such adjournment is permitted under the Merger Agreement.

 



3 (b) Prior to the Expiration Date, at every meeting of shareholders of the
Company or at any adjournment thereof or in any other circumstances upon
which such Shareholders vote, consent or other approval (including by written
consent) is sought, such Shareholder shall vote (or cause to be voted) the
Subject Shares against (i) any Adverse Acquisition Agreement, (ii) any
Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, (iii) any action, proposal,
transaction or agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in a
breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of the Company under the Merger Agreement, and (iv) any amendment of
the Companys Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws or other action,
proposal or transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
which amendment or other action, proposal or transaction would reasonably be
expected to impede, interfere with, delay, frustrate, prevent or nullify any
provision of the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated thereby, inhibit the timely consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby or change in any manner the voting rights of
any class of capital stock of the Company. Prior to the Expiration Date, such
Shareholder shall not commit or agree to take any action inconsistent with
the foregoing.

(c) Such Shareholder hereby irrevocably grants to, and appoints, Parent,
and any individual designated in writing by Parent, and each of them
individually, as such Shareholders proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full
power of substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of such
Shareholder, to vote the Subject Shares, or grant a consent or approval in
respect of the Subject Shares, in a manner required by this _Section 4_. Such
Shareholder understands and acknowledges that Parent is entering into the
Merger Agreement and the applicable Ancillary Documents in reliance upon such
Shareholders execution and delivery of this Agreement. Such Shareholder
hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this _Section 4(c)_ is
given in consideration of the execution of the Merger Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance
of the duties of such Shareholder under this Agreement. Such Shareholder
hereby further affirms that the irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest
and may under no circumstances be revoked except upon the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms. Such Shareholder hereby ratifies and
confirms all actions that such irrevocable proxy may lawfully take or cause to
be taken by virtue hereof. Such irrevocable proxy is executed and intended to
be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of all applicable Law,
including NRS 78.355. The irrevocable proxy granted hereunder shall
automatically terminate upon the termination of this Agreement. With respect
to the proxy granted hereunder by such Shareholder, Parent agrees not to
exercise this proxy if such Shareholder complies with his obligations in this
Agreement. Such Shareholder shall take all further action or execute such
other instruments as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the intent of
this proxy.

(d) Prior to the Expiration Date, such Shareholder shall not (i) directly or
indirectly offer, sell, transfer, assign, exchange, pledge, encumber or
otherwise dispose of (including by gift) (collectively, " _Transfer_ "),
or enter into any contract, option, agreement, understanding or other
arrangement (including any profit sharing arrangement) with respect to a
Transfer of, any of such Shareholders Company Shares, or any interest
therein, to any Person, 

 



4  (ii) enter into any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting agreement
or otherwise, with respect to any of such Shareholders Subject Shares or
(iii) commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions.

(e) Such Shareholder (in his capacity as such) shall not engage, nor shall
such Shareholder (in his capacity as such) authorize or permit any investment
banker, attorney, accountant or other representative or agent (collectively,
the " _Shareholder Representatives_ ") of such Shareholder (in his capacity as
such) to engage, directly or indirectly, in any activity that would be
prohibited pursuant to Section 4.11 of the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Company, in compliance with
the provisions of Section 4.11 of the Merger Agreement, has provided
information to or entered into discussions or negotiations with, any Person in
response to an Acquisition Proposal made by such Person, then such Shareholder
and his Shareholder Representatives may provide information to and engage in
discussions or negotiations with such Person only to the extent the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors and the
Company Representatives are permitted to do so pursuant to the terms
of Section 4.11 of the Merger Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing
in this _Section 4(e)_ shall limit or affect any actions or omissions taken
by any Shareholder in such Shareholders capacity as a director or officer
of the Company, including in exercising rights under the Merger Agreement
(including under Section 4.11 thereof), and no such actions or omissions shall
be deemed a breach of this _Section 4(e)_.

 

(f) Such Shareholder (in his capacity as such) shall not issue any press
release or make any other public statement with respect to this Agreement,
the Merger Agreement, the other Ancillary Documents, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated thereby without the prior consent of Parent.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Shareholder
shall be limited or restricted in any way from acting in such Shareholders
fiduciary capacity as a director or officer of the Company, in order for such
Shareholder to comply with such Shareholders fiduciary duties as a director
or officer of the Company. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no Shareholder shall be limited or restricted in
any way from voting in such Shareholders sole discretion on any matter other
than the matters referred to in _Sections 4(a)_ and _(b)_ hereof.
The parties acknowledge that this Agreement shall apply to each Shareholder
solely in such Shareholders capacity as a shareholder of the Company and that
no Shareholder makes any agreement or understanding herein in his capacity as
a director or officer of the Company.

(h) Such Shareholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that such Shareholder is
not and shall not be entitled to any dissenters rights under NRS Chapter 92A
or any other rights of appraisal in connection with the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and
notwithstanding the foregoing, hereby waives, and agrees not to assert or
perfect, any and all rights of dissent or appraisal such Shareholder may have
by virtue of ownership of any of the Company Shares.

 

(i) Such Shareholder hereby acknowledges that such Shareholder is familiar
with and has reviewed the Merger Agreement, understands that the only
consideration the such Shareholder is entitled to receive as a holder of
Company Shares in connection with the Merger is the consideration to be paid
pursuant to the Merger Agreement and such Shareholder hereby consents to such
consideration, including the amount and form thereof.

 



5 SECTION 5. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to
occur of (i) the mutual consent of the parties hereto set forth in a written
instrument signed by each of the parties, (ii) the Effective Time, (iii) the
termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and (iv) the
effectiveness of any modification, amendment or waiver to the Merger Agreement
that materially reduces, adversely affects, delays the payment of, or changes
the form of, the consideration payable to the stockholders of the
Company after the date hereof (such earliest time, the " _Expiration Date_
").

SECTION 6. _Additional Matters_.

(a) Each Shareholder shall, from time to time, execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, such additional or further consents, documents
and other instruments as Parent may reasonably request for the purpose of
effectively carrying out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Company
Shares shall remain vested in and belong to each Shareholder, and Parent
shall have no authority to manage, direct, superintend, restrict, regulate,
govern or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or
exercise any power or authority to direct any Shareholder in the voting of any
of the Company Shares, except as otherwise provided herein.

SECTION 7. _General Provisions_.

 

(a) _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement (including the Schedules
hereto) represents the entire understanding and agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter herein and can be amended only by a written
instrument signed by each of the parties. No action taken pursuant to this
Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be
deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance
with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The
waiver by any party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or
as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other
remedies, equitable or legal, except as set forth in _Section 7(j)_ _._

(b) _Notice_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered personally by hand (with
written confirmation of receipt); (ii) when sent by facsimile or electronic
mail transmission of a " _portable document format_ " (". _pdf_ ") attachment
(provided that any notice received by facsimile or electronic mail
transmission or otherwise at the addressees location on any Business Day
after 5:00 p.m. (addressees local time) shall be deemed to have been
received at 9:00 a.m.

 



6  (addressees local time) on the next Business Day); or (iii) one (1)
Business Day following the day sent by overnight courier (with written
confirmation of receipt), in each case, to Parent in accordance with Section
7.9 of the Merger Agreement and to each Shareholder at its address set forth
on _Schedule A_ hereto (or at such other address for a party as shall be
specified by like notice).

 

(c) _Interpretation_. Unless otherwise expressly provided, for purposes of
this Agreement and any Schedules attached hereto, the following rules of
interpretation shall apply:

(i) The Schedules to this Agreement are hereby incorporated and made a part
hereof and are an integral part of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used
in any Schedule but not otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set
forth in this Agreement;

 

(ii) Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall include all genders, and
words imparting the singular number only shall include the plural and vice
versa;

(iii) The division of this Agreement into Sections and other subdivisions and
the insertion of headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not
affect or be utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All
references in this Agreement to any " _Section_ " are to the corresponding
Section of this Agreement unless otherwise specified;

(iv) The words such as " _herein_ ," " _hereinafter_ ," " _hereof_ ," and "
_hereunder_ " refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a
subdivision in which such words appear unless the context otherwise expressly
requires;

 

(v) The word " _including_ " or any variation thereof means " _including,
without limitation_ ," and shall not be construed to limit any general
statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it; and

(vi) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by
the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 

(d) _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is held
to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties.

(e) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, shall be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in
counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail
transmission in .pdf form, or by any other electronic means intended to
preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, shall
be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 



7 (f) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns any legal
or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 

(g) _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action
(whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, performance, validity,
interpretation, construction and enforcement of this Agreement (including any
claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada applicable to
contracts made and performed in such state, without regard to any choice or
conflict of laws provisions or rules (whether of the State of Nevada or
otherwise) that would require the application of the Law of any other
jurisdiction.

 

(h) _Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process; Waiver of Jury
Trial_.

 

(i) The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada, and in the absence of
such jurisdiction, the exclusive jurisdiction of any other federal or state
court located within the State of Nevada, over any dispute arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and each party hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such
dispute or any suit, action proceeding related thereto may be heard and
determined in such courts. The parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which they may now
or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such
court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such
dispute. Each of the parties agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law.

(ii) Each of the parties hereby consents to process being served by any party
to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by delivery of a copy
thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 7(b)_.

 

(iii) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, IN EACH CASE, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT 

 



8  AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT
TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF EACH RESPECTIVE PARTYS
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER; (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 7(h)(iii)_.

 

(i) _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or
obligations hereunder by any party may be made without the prior written
consent of the other party and any attempted assignment without the required
consent shall be void, _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may assign, or
may cause its permitted affiliates to assign, (without the other partys
consent) this Agreement to any entity in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the following sentence. Parent may assign (without the other partys
consent) this Agreement and any or all of their respective rights or
obligations hereunder (including Parents rights to seek indemnification
hereunder) to any Affiliate of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve
Parent of any Liability hereunder.

(j) _Remedies_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any term or provision of this Agreement was not performed by any
party in accordance with the terms hereof and that each party shall be
entitled to (after obtaining the appropriate court order pursuant to this 
_Section 7(j)_) an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or specific performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedies to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity, in each case without the requirement of posting any bond or other
type of security; provided, however, that injunctive relief shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy available to Parent for any breach by a Shareholder of
Section 4(e) of this Agreement, unless such Shareholder willfully breached
Section 4(e), in which case Parent shall also be entitled to any other
remedies to which it is entitled at law or in equity. Each party hereby agrees
not to raise any objection or legal or equitable defense to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches of this Agreement by another party, and to specifically enforce the
terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of another party under this Agreement.
