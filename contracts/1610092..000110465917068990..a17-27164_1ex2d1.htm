 ** _RECITALS_**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Purchaser desires to acquire (i) all of the issued and
outstanding limited liability company interests of the Company (other than the
Blockers Units) through a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company,
with the Company continuing as the surviving limited liability company, and
(ii) the remaining issued and outstanding limited liability company interests

") has, in accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (as
amended from time to time, the " _DLLCA_ ") and the Company LLC Agreement,

 ** _AGREEMENT_**

 



 

In consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained herein and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I _ 
THE SECURITIES PURCHASE AND THE MERGER_**

 



 

1.1 _Sale and Purchase of Blockers  Equity_. On the Closing Date, immediately
prior to the Effective Time and immediately following the dissolution of LDI
Nautic VIII-A Splitter, L.P. (" _Nautic VIII-A Splitter_ "), pursuant to
_Section 6.11_, each Blocker Seller, severally and not jointly, shall sell
and transfer (or cause to be sold and transferred) to the Purchaser, and the
Purchaser shall purchase from each Blocker Seller, all of the Blockers Equity
held by such Blocker Seller, free and clear of all Liens (other than those
imposed by or arising out of state or federal securities laws), for a purchase
price equal to the sum of (i) a portion of the Transaction Consideration
attributable to the applicable Blockers Equity, and (ii) a contingent right
to receive a portion of the Additional Payment, if any, distributable thereto
pursuant to _Section 2.5_, in each case in accordance with the Allocation
Statement. The portion of the Transaction Consideration payable by the
Purchaser to each Blocker Seller at the Closing in exchange for its Blockers
Equity shall be (i) allocated as between the Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration as set forth in the Allocation Statement, and (ii) equal to the
portion of the Transaction Consideration that would have been allocable to the
Blockers Units held by the Blocker owned by such Blocker Seller in accordance
with the Allocation Statement). Any portion of the Additional Payment, if any,
payable to a Blocker Seller shall be payable in cash in accordance with terms
hereof. The purchase and sale of Blockers Equity described in this Section
1.1 shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Securities Purchase_ ".

 



 

1.2 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall, pursuant to the provisions of the
DLLCA, be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), and the
separate entity existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease in accordance
with the provisions of the DLLCA. The Company shall be the surviving limited
liability company in the Merger and shall continue to exist as the surviving
limited liability company under its present name pursuant to the provisions of
the DLLCA. The separate existence of the Company with all its rights,
privileges, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. The
Merger shall have the effects specified in the DLLCA. From and after the
Effective Time, the Company shall be referred to herein as the " _Surviving
Company_ ".

 



 

1.3 _Certificate of Merger_. On the Closing Date and in connection with the
Closing, the Parties shall cause a certificate of merger in the form of
_Exhibit A_ attached hereto (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be properly
executed and filed in accordance with the DLLCA with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware. The Merger shall be effective at the time (the "
_Effective Time_ ") and on the date of the filing of the Certificate of Merger
in accordance with the DLLCA.

 



      
 

 



 

1.4 _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall
be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DLLCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub or the
Company, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

 



 

1.5 _Certificate of Formation_. At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Merger Sub or the Company, the
certificate of formation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time will become the certificate of formation of Surviving Company,
except that the name of the Surviving Company will be "LDI Holding Company,
LLC" until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or under
applicable Law.

 



 

1.6 _Limited Liability Company Agreement_. Subject to the provisions of
_Section 6.8_, the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving
Company shall be amended and restated at and as of the Effective Time in a
form acceptable to Purchaser. Such amended and restated limited liability
company agreement shall be the limited liability company agreement of the
Surviving Company until amended in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

1.7 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Transactions (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00
a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of Goodwin Procter LLP, 100 Northern
Avenue, Boston, MA 02210, no later than two (2) Business Days following the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions precedent specified under _Article
VII_ hereof (except for those conditions which by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions), or such other date, place and time as the Parties may agree in
writing (the " _Closing Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the Closing Date be earlier than the date that is thirty (30) days
following the date of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser and the Company.

 



 

1.8 _Deliveries at Closing_.

 



 

(a) At (or prior to) the Closing, the Company shall deliver (or cause to be
delivered) to the Purchaser:

 



 

(i) an officers certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, duly executed by
an authorized officer of the Company (in his or her capacity as such and not
in his or her individual capacity), relating to the satisfaction of the
Closing conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ and _Section 7.2(b)_;

 



 

(ii) the Estimated Closing Statement and the Allocation Statement, each duly
executed by an authorized officer of the Company;

 



 

(iii) the following certifications: (A) a certificate from the Company in a

Person executing such certificate is a general partner of the Company within
the meaning of such Section of the Treasury Regulations, and (B) a statement
from each Blocker issued to Purchaser, pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.897-2(h), certifying that none of such Blocker Sellers Blocker
Equity is a U.S. real property interest, along with (1) a form of notice to
the Internal Revenue Service, prepared and executed before (but no more than
30 days before) the Closing by a responsible corporate officer of such Blocker
and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of Treasury regulation
Section 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3), certifying that none of such Blockers
Blocker Equity is a "United States real property interest" (as defined in
Section 897(c)(1)(A) of the Code), (2) a form of notice to the IRS, prepared
and executed before (but no more than 30 days before) the Closing by a
responsible corporate officer of such Blocker and otherwise in accordance with

the Securityholder Representative, Purchaser and the Securityholder
Representative shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint written
instruction instructing the Escrow Agent to release and distribute the amount
(if any) (the " _Escrow Release Amount_ ") equal to (1) the Escrow Amount,

pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(v)_ if the Preliminary Statement were the Final
Statement, to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Sellers in
respect of all Eligible Equity, in accordance with the Allocation Statement,
an updated version of which will be delivered by the Securityholder
Representative to Purchaser and the Paying Agent in connection therewith. If
the Escrow Release Amount is not a positive number, then Purchaser and the
Securityholder Representative shall not deliver to the Escrow Agent such a
joint written instruction and the Escrow Release Amount will be deemed to be
zero ($0) for all purposes under this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) The Securityholder Representative shall have forty-five (45) days to
review the Preliminary Statement from the date of its receipt thereof (the "
_Review Period_ "). During the Review Period, the Securityholder
Representative shall have reasonable access (including the right to make

and advisors of the Company and the Subsidiary to the extent reasonably
required in connection with such review. If the Securityholder Representative
objects to any aspect of the Preliminary Statement, the Securityholder
Representative must deliver a written notice of such objection, specifying in
reasonable detail the items so disputed together with the basis for such
dispute (the " _Objection Notice_ ") to the Purchaser on or prior to the
expiration of the Review Period. If the Securityholder Representative delivers
an Objection Notice to the Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Review
Period as provided in this _Section 2.3(b)_, the Purchaser and the

 



      
 

 



 

Securityholder Representative shall, for a period of thirty (30) days
thereafter (the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith to resolve the
matters contained therein, and any written resolution, signed by each of the
Purchaser and the Securityholder Representative, as to any such matter shall
be final, binding, conclusive and non-appealable for all purposes hereunder.
In the event the Securityholder Representative does not deliver an Objection
Notice to the Purchaser as provided in this _Section 2.3(b)_ prior to the

hereunder.

Securityholder Representative have not reached an agreement with respect to
all disputed matters contained in the Objection Notice, then within ten (10)
Business Days thereafter, the Purchaser and the Securityholder Representative
shall submit for resolution those of such matters remaining in dispute to
Grant Thornton LLP, or if such firm is unavailable or unwilling to so serve,
to a mutually acceptable nationally recognized independent accounting firm (as
the case may be, the " _Neutral Arbitrator_ "). The Neutral Arbitrator shall
act as an arbitrator to resolve (based solely on the applicable provisions of
this Agreement and written presentations of the Purchaser and the
Securityholder Representative and not by independent review) only those
matters submitted to it in accordance with the first sentence of this _Section
2.3(b)(iv)_. The Purchaser and the Securityholder Representative shall direct
the Neutral Arbitrator to render a resolution of all such disputed matters
within thirty (30) days after its engagement or such other period agreed upon
in writing by the Purchaser and the Securityholder Representative. The
resolution of the Neutral Arbitrator shall be set forth in a written statement
delivered to each of the Purchaser and the Securityholder Representative and
shall be final, binding, conclusive and non-appealable for all purposes
hereunder. The Preliminary Statement, once modified and/or agreed to in
accordance with this _Section 2.3(b)(iv)_, shall become the " _Final
Statement_ ," and will determine the Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount
(the " _Final Net Working Capital_ "), the Closing Cash (the " _Final Closing
Cash_ "), the Closing Indebtedness (the " _Final Closing Indebtedness_ "), and
the Selling Expenses (the " _Final Selling Expenses_ "), the calculation of
which will produce the Cash Consideration as set forth in the Final Statement
(referred to herein as the " _Final Cash Consideration_."

 



 

(v) All fees and expenses relating to the work performed by the Neutral
Arbitrator shall be borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Securityholder Representative, on the other hand, based upon the percentage
which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each Party bears to
the amount actually contested by such Party, as determined by the Neutral
Arbitrator. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs and
expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving any dispute
hereunder before the Neutral Arbitrator shall be borne by the Party incurring
such cost and expense.

 



 

(vi) If the Estimated Cash Consideration exceeds the Final Cash Consideration
(the amount of such excess, the " _Downward Adjustment Amount_ "), then the
Securityholder Representative and the Purchaser shall promptly execute and
deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to (x) effectuate
disbursement of the Downward Adjustment Amount to the Purchaser from the
Escrow Account, and (y) effectuate the

 



      
 

 



 

disbursement of the remaining amount of the Escrow Amount, if any, to the
Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Sellers in respect of all
Eligible Equity, in accordance with the Allocation Statement, an updated
version of which will be delivered by the Securityholder Representative to
Purchaser and the Paying Agent in connection therewith.

 



 

(vii) If the Final Cash Consideration exceeds the Estimated Cash Consideration
(the amount of such excess, the " _Upward Adjustment Amount_ "), then (x) the
Purchaser shall pay, within three (3) Business Days after the date on which
the Preliminary Statement becomes the Final Statement, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to
Sellers in respect of all Eligible Equity, in accordance with the Allocation
Statement, an updated version of which will be delivered by the Securityholder
Representative to Purchaser and the Paying Agent in connection therewith, an
amount equal to the Upward Adjustment Amount, and (y) the Securityholder
Representative and the Purchaser shall promptly execute and deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to effectuate the disbursement of the
Escrow Amount to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Sellers in
respect of all Eligible Equity, in accordance with the Allocation Statement,
an updated version of which will be delivered by the Securityholder
Representative to Purchaser and the Paying Agent in connection therewith.

 



 

2.4 _Escrow Account; Securityholder Expense Amount Holdback_.

 



 

(a) The Escrow Amount to be deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)_ shall be held in a designated escrow account (the " _Escrow
Account_ ") in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Securityholder Expense Amount deposited with the Securityholder
Representative pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ shall be held in an account
maintained by the Securityholder Representative (the " _Holdback Account_ ")
for the Securityholder Representative to hold on behalf of the Sellers
pursuant to the terms of _Section 10.10_. The Holdback Account need not be
invested, and need not earn interest or other income. To the extent any amount
becomes payable out of the Holdback Account to the Sellers, the Securityholder
Representative shall cause such amounts to be paid in accordance with this
_Section 2.4_.

 



 

(c) The Parties agree that for federal and applicable state and local income
Tax purposes: (i) Purchaser shall be treated as the owner of the Escrow
Account and all interest and earnings earned from the investment and
reinvestment of the Escrow Amount, or any portion thereof, shall be allocable
to Purchaser pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code and Proposed Treasury
Regulation Section 1.468B-8, (ii) the right of the Sellers to the Escrow
Account shall be treated as deferred contingent purchase price eligible for
installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law, as appropriate, (iii) if and to the
extent any amount of the Escrow Account is actually distributed to the
Sellers, interest may be imputed on such amount as required by Section 483 or
1274 of the Code and (iv) in the event any interest and earnings earned
thereon paid to the Sellers under this Agreement exceeds the imputed interest,
such interest shall be treated as interest or other income and not as purchase
price. Clause (iv) of the preceding sentence is intended to ensure that the
right of the Sellers to the Escrow Amount and any interest and earnings earned
thereon is not

 



      
 

 



 

treated as a contingent payment without a stated maximum selling price under
Section 453 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.
All Parties hereto shall file all Tax Returns consistently with the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 2.4(c)_.

 



 

2.5 _Payment of Additional Payments_. Any Additional Payment required to be
paid to the Sellers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement shall be allocated among the Sellers in accordance with the
Allocation Statement and shall be paid to or on behalf of such Persons, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, to the Paying Agent, for further
distribution to each Seller in respect of all Eligible Equity, in accordance
with the Allocation Statement, an updated version of which will be delivered
by the Securityholder Representative to Purchaser and the Paying Agent in
connection therewith; _provided_ , _that_ , that no Seller shall be entitled
to receive Additional Payments until such Person shall have delivered a duly
executed and completed Letter of Transmittal.

 



 

2.6 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Parties agree to allocate the

days) after the determination of the Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount,
as finally determined, the Securityholder Representative shall deliver to the
Purchaser a schedule of such allocation (the " _Tax Allocation Schedule_ ").

comment on the Tax Allocation Schedule. If, within ten (10) days of the end of
such thirty (30) day period, Purchaser notifies Securityholder Representative
of Purchasers disagreement with the Tax Allocation Schedule, then Purchaser
and Securityholder Representative shall, during the ensuing seven (7) days,
negotiate in good faith to resolve such disagreement, failing which such
disagreement shall be submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator for resolution in
accordance with the procedures of _Section 2.3(b)_, _mutatis mutandis_ ;
_provided_ , that any resolution made by the Neutral Arbitrator shall be made
in a manner consistent with the purchase price allocation methodology set
forth in _Schedule 2.6_. The Purchaser and Unitholders and their Affiliates
shall report, act and file Tax Returns including, but not limited to, IRS Form

(with respect to the Unitholders), in all respects and for all purposes
consistent with the Tax Allocation Schedule, as the same may be modified by
agreement of Purchaser and Securityholder Representative, or by the Neutral
Arbitrator, in accordance with the foregoing. Neither the Purchaser nor the
Unitholders shall take any position for Tax purposes (whether in Tax audits or
on Tax Returns) that is inconsistent with the Tax Allocation Schedule (as so
modified) unless required to do so by applicable Law.

Plans or under any other arrangement that is a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan or otherwise to pay any separation, severance, termination
or similar benefit as a result of any transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or solely as a result of a change in control or ownership within the
meaning of Section 280G of the Code. Neither the execution of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement or the other documents relating to this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder, will
increase the amount of benefits otherwise payable under any Employee Plan or
result in the acceleration of the time of payment, funding or vesting of any
such benefits.

or other materials shall be deemed a

 



      
 

 



 

representation or warranty hereunder or otherwise or deemed to be relied upon
by the Purchaser or Merger Sub in executing, delivering and performing this
Agreement and the Transactions. It is understood that any estimates, budgets,

executing, delivering and performing this Agreement and the Transaction.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V _ 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER_**

 



 

The Purchaser and Merger Sub hereby, jointly and severally, represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

5.1 _Organization_. Each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub was duly organized or
formed, as the case may be, and is validly existing under the applicable laws
of its jurisdiction of organization, has all requisite corporate or requisite
limited liability company power and authority, as applicable, to carry on its
business as now conducted and to own or lease and operate its properties and
assets.

 



 

5.2 _Authority and Validity_. Each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub has all
requisite corporate or requisite limited liability company power and
authority, as applicable, to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to
which the Purchaser or Merger Sub is a party, to carry out its obligations
under such Transaction Documents and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents to which the Purchaser or
Merger Sub is a party and the consummation of the Transactions has been duly
and validly authorized by each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub, and no other
proceedings on the part of the Purchaser or Merger Sub are necessary to
approve the Transaction Documents to which the Purchaser or Merger Sub is a
party or to consummate the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other Parties,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of the Purchaser and Merger
Sub, enforceable against each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, subject to General
Enforceability Exceptions.

 



 

5.3 _No Violation_. The execution and delivery by each of the Purchaser and
Merger Sub of the Transaction Documents to which the Purchaser or Merger Sub
is a party do not, and the consummation of the Transaction, and performance by
each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub of their obligations hereunder and
thereunder, will not (i) result in a violation or breach of any provision of
the Governing Documents of either the Purchaser or Merger Sub, (ii) result in
a material violation or material breach of any provision of any Law or Order
applicable to the Purchaser or Merger Sub, or (iii) except with respect to
Purchasers existing lenders and in connection with the Debt Financing,
require the consent of any Person under, conflict with, result in a violation
or breach of, constitute a default under or result in the acceleration of any

 



      
 

 



 

Contract to which the Purchaser or Merger Sub is a party or by which the
Purchaser or Merger Sub is bound or to which any of the Purchasers or Merger
Subs properties or assets is subject, except where the violation, breach,
conflict, default, acceleration or failure to give notice would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to delay or impair
the Purchasers or Merger Subs abilities to consummate the Transaction. No
consent, approval, Order, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any
Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to the Purchaser or Merger
Sub in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transaction, except for (x) such filings as may be
required under the HSR Act and for filings required under the Exchange Act or
under applicable federal and state securities laws, (y) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger, and (z) such consents, approvals, Permits, Orders,
declarations, filings or notices that the failure to take or make, as the case
may be, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
delay or impair the Purchasers or Merger Subs abilities to consummate the
Transaction.

 



 

5.4 _Litigation_. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge
of the Purchaser or Merger Sub, threatened, against or affecting the Purchaser
or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates that relate to this
Agreement or the Transactions, nor is there any Order of any Governmental
Entity binding on Purchaser or Merger Sub, that challenges the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or seeks to enjoin or prohibit consummation
of, or seek other material equitable relief with respect to, the Transactions
or that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
delay or impair the Purchasers or Merger Subs abilities to consummate the
Transactions.

 



 

5.5 _Brokers or Finders_. All negotiations relating to this Agreement and the
Transactions have been carried on without the intervention of any Person
acting on behalf of the Purchaser or Merger Sub in such manner as to give rise
to any valid claim against any Securityholder, any Blocker Seller, any Blocker
or the Company and/or the Subsidiary for any brokerage or finders commission,
fee, or similar compensation.

 



 

5.6 _Financing_. The Purchaser has delivered to the Company and attached
hereto as _Exhibit E_ true, complete and correct copies of each of the
executed Financing Letters. The Purchaser has fully paid (or caused to be
paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees in connection with the
Financing Letters that are required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof,
and as of the date hereof, the Financing Letters are in full force and effect
and are legal, valid and binding obligations of the Purchaser, and to the
knowledge of the Purchaser, the other parties thereto enforceable in
accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles. As of the date of this
Agreement none of the obligations or commitments under the Financing Letters
have been withdrawn, rescinded, terminated or replaced in any respect, and, to
the knowledge of the Purchaser, no such withdrawal, rescission, termination or
replacement of the obligations or commitments thereunder is contemplated as of
the date of this Agreement. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies relating to the funding of the Debt Financing equal to the
Required Amount (as defined below) other than as expressly set forth in the
Financing Letters. As of the date of this Agreement, (i) Purchaser is not in
breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in any of the Financing
Letters, (ii) no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would

 



      
 

 



 

reasonably be expected to constitute a breach by the Purchaser or failure by
the Purchaser to satisfy any condition precedent set forth in the Financing
Letters, (iii) no party to any of the Financing Letters has notified the
Purchaser of its intention to terminate or reduce its commitment under the
Financing Letter and (iv) Purchaser has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing will fail to timely be satisfied or that the
full amount of the Debt Financing will be unavailable on the Closing Date
assuming that the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ are
satisfied in accordance with their terms. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements to
which the Purchaser is a party relating to the Financing Letters that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the availability of the Financing
in any material respect, other than as set forth in the Financing Letters. The
aggregate net proceeds from the Debt Financing (both before and after giving
effect to any "flex" provisions) together with available cash or other sources
of immediately available funds will be sufficient to consummate the
Transactions, including the payment of all amounts required to be paid under
_Section 2.1_, the payment of any fees and expenses of or payable by
Purchaser and any related repayment or refinancing of any Closing
Indebtedness, and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions, including amounts required to be paid in
connection with the Financing Letters and all fees, expenses and other amounts
in connection with the Debt Financing (the " _Required Amount_ "). The
obligations of Purchaser to consummate the Merger at Closing upon satisfaction
of the conditions precedent set forth in _Section 7.01_ are not contingent on
Purchasers ability to obtain the Financing.

 



 

5.7 _Solvency_. Immediately following the Effective Time, and after giving
effect to the Merger and assuming the accuracy of the representations in
_ARTICLE III_ and _ARTICLE IV_ and the financial information for the Company
provided to Purchaser and the compliance by Sellers and the Company with this
Agreement, the Surviving Company and the Subsidiary on a consolidated basis
will be Solvent. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Solvent_ " when used with
respect to the Surviving Company, means that, as of immediately following the
Effective Time and after giving effect to the Merger, (a) the Present Fair
Saleable Value of its assets will, as of such date, exceed its liabilities as
of such date, (b) the Surviving Company will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of assets or capital for the business in which it is
engaged or will be engaged, and (c) the Surviving Company will be able to pay
its debts as they become absolute and matured, in the ordinary course of
business. The term "Solvency" shall have a correlative meaning. For purposes
of the definition of "Solvent", "debt" means liability on a right to payment,
whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured. " _Present Fair Saleable Value_ " means the amount that
may be realized if the aggregate assets of the Surviving Company (including
goodwill) are sold as an entirety with reasonable promptness in an arms
length transaction under present conditions for the sale of comparable
business enterprises.

 



 

5.8 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_. Purchaser has timely filed all forms,
reports and documents required to be filed by it with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since January 1, 2016
through the date of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Purchaser SEC
Documents_ "). Each of the Purchaser SEC Documents, at the time of its filing
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to the Purchaser SEC Documents.
As of their respective dates (or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of
the date of such amendment), the Purchaser SEC Documents did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. The
financial statements (including any related notes) contained in the Purchaser
SEC Documents fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby in accordance with GAAP applied
on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered (except as may be
indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC, and except that
unaudited financial statements may not contain footnotes and are subject to
year-end adjustments).

 



 

5.9 _Legal Compliance; NYSE Requirements_. Purchaser and Merger Sub are in
compliance with all applicable New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ")
requirements applicable to the listing of Purchasers securities on the NYSE,
except where the failure to comply would not have a material and adverse
effect on the Purchaser or Merger Sub. Purchaser is not required to obtain
stockholder approval of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
pursuant to the rules of the NYSE applicable to listed companies. None of the
Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries is in default or
violation of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, rule, order, judgment or
decree of a Governmental Entity that is applicable to the Purchaser, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset
of the Purchaser, Merger Sub or their respective Subsidiaries is bound, except
for any such conflicts, defaults or violations that have not, or would not
reasonably be expected to have, a material and adverse effect on the Purchaser
or Merger Sub.

 



 

5.10 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since June 30, 2017 and until the
date of this Agreement, except as disclosed in the Purchaser SEC Documents,
Purchaser has conducted its business only in the ordinary course of business,
consistent with past practice in all material respects, and there has not
occurred: (a) any change, event or condition (whether or not covered by
insurance) that, individually or in the aggregate with any other changes,
events or conditions, has resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to
result in, a material adverse effect of the Purchaser, (b) any declaration,
setting aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution (whether in
cash, stock or property) with respect to Purchaser Common Stock, (c) any
amendment of any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or bylaws of, or
of any material term of any outstanding security issued by, Purchaser, (d) any
material change in any method of accounting or accounting practice of
Purchaser except for any such change required by a change in GAAP, or any
split, combination or reclassification of Purchaser Common Stock or any
issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any other securities in
respect of, in lieu of, or in substitution for shares of Purchaser Common
Stock.

 



 

5.11 _S-3 Eligibility; Registration Statement_. Purchaser is eligible to
register secondary offerings of securities, including the resale of the shares
of Purchaser Common Stock constituting the Stock Consideration on a
registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities

 



      
 

 



 

Act and a well-known seasoned issuer as defined under Rule 405 of the
Securities Act. Subject to Purchaser continuing to meet the requirements for
well-known seasoned issuer status at Closing and receipt of the Required
Financials and Audits, to Purchasers Actual Knowledge, no reason exists which
would prevent a registration statement for the Registrable Securities on Form
S-3 filed at the Closing (the " _Registration Statement_ ") from becoming
automatically effective upon filing with the SEC pursuant to this Agreement.
Any such Registration Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto,
when and if filed in accordance with this Agreement, will comply as to form in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act. At the time
the Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto becomes
effective, the Registration Statement, as amended or supplemented, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading, in light of the circumstances in which they
are made. The representations and warranties contained in this _Section 5.11_
will not apply to statements or omissions in the Registration Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto based upon information furnished to Purchaser
by the Company specifically for use therein.

 



 

5.12 _Capitalization and Related Matters_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of Purchaser (" _Purchaser Capital Stock_ ")
consists of 590,000,000 shares of Purchaser Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares
of preferred stock. As of the date hereof, 68,873,219 shares of Purchaser
Common Stock (net of treasury shares) were issued and outstanding. As of the
date hereof, no shares of Purchaser Company Preferred Stock are issued and
outstanding **. **As of the date hereof, Purchaser has outstanding employee
stock options to purchase an aggregate of 5,847,648 shares of Purchaser Common
Stock (of which options to purchase an aggregate of 1,399,396 shares of
Purchaser Common Stock were exercisable) (" _Purchaser Options_ "). Other than
the Purchaser Options and except pursuant to the Purchasers 2014 Omnibus
Incentive Plan, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
commitments, preemptive rights, deferred compensation rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any kind to which the Purchaser is a party
relating to the issuance of, or outstanding securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for, any shares of capital stock of any class or
other equity interests of the Purchaser. All shares of Purchaser Capital Stock
have been duly authorized, and all issued and outstanding shares of Purchaser
Common Stock have been validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

 



 

(b) The shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in accordance with this
Agreement will, upon such issuance, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable, free of any Liens (other than Liens created by this
Agreement or any obligations of the holder thereof to comply with applicable
laws in connection with the sale or transfer thereof), will be issued without
violation of the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws.

 



 

5.13 _No Other Representations_. NONE OF THE PURCHASER, THE MERGER SUB OR
THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES OR DIRECT OR INDIRECT EQUITYHOLDERS HAS MADE,
AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE MADE, ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED OR OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER RELATING TO THE PURCHASER, THE
MERGER SUB OR THE BUSINESS OF THE PURCHASER OR THE MERGER SUB OR OTHERWISE IN

 



      
 

 



 

CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION, AND DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE OR COMMUNICATED (ORALLY OR IN WRITING,
INCLUDING ANY OPINION, INFORMATION OR ADVICE WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES) TO THE OTHER PARTIES, OTHER THAN THOSE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE V.

 



 

5.14 _Due Diligence Investigation; No Other Representations_. Each of the
Purchaser and Merger Sub is an informed and sophisticated Person, and has
engaged expert advisors experienced in the evaluation and acquisition of
companies such as the Blockers, the Company and the Subsidiary as contemplated
hereunder. Each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub has undertaken such
investigation and has been provided with and has evaluated such documents and
information as it has deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed and
intelligent decision with respect to the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the Transactions. Each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub
has been afforded the opportunity to obtain any additional information
necessary, including gaining access to the Representatives of the Blockers,
the Company and the Subsidiary, to verify the accuracy of any such information
or of any representation or warranty made by the Blocker Sellers, the Company
and/or the Subsidiary hereunder or otherwise to evaluate the merits of the
Transactions. Each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub has completed to its
satisfaction its own due diligence review with respect to the Blockers, the
Company and the Subsidiary and is entering into the Transactions based on the
foregoing investigation and due diligence. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, each of the Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledges that (a) none
of the Blocker Sellers, the Company, the Subsidiary, their respective
Representatives or direct or indirect equityholders has made or is making any
representation or warranty with respect to (i) any estimates, budgets,
projections or predictions delivered to or made available to the Purchaser or
Merger Sub or any other Person of future revenues, future results of
operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of the Blockers, the Company, the
Subsidiary or the future business and operations of the Blockers, the Company
and the Subsidiary or (ii) any other information or documents made available
to the Purchaser or Merger Sub or their Representatives with respect to the
Blockers, the Company and the Subsidiary, or any of their respective
businesses, assets, liabilities or operations, except as expressly set forth
in _Article III_ and/or _Article IV_ hereof, and (b) neither the Purchaser
nor Merger Sub has relied nor will either rely upon any of the information
described in sub clauses (i) and (ii) of clause (a) above or any other
information, representation or warranty, except those representations or
warranties set forth in _Article III_ and/or _Article IV_ hereof (in each
case, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedule), in negotiating, executing,
delivering and performing the Transaction Documents, as applicable, and the
Transaction. The Purchaser and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge and agree to the
disclaimers set forth in _Section 3.26_ and _Section 4.6_ and that, except
to the extent specifically set forth in _Article III_ and/or _Article IV_
hereof (in each case, as qualified by the Disclosure Schedule), the Purchaser
and Merger Sub are acquiring the Blockers, the Company and the Subsidiary on
an "as is, where is" basis with all faults.

 



       
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI _ 
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

6.1 _Publicity_. The Parties will, and will cause each of their respective
Affiliates and representatives to, maintain the confidentiality of this
Agreement and will not, and will cause each of their respective Affiliates not
to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
announcement or disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions
without the prior written consent of the Securityholder Representative and the

disclosure by a Party to the extent that such Party reasonably determines,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that such action is required by
Law or by the rules of any applicable self-regulatory organization, the SEC or
the NYSE, in which event such Party will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the Securityholder Representative and the Purchaser
and allow reasonable time to comment on such disclosure, and to reasonably
incorporate any such comments to the extent related to the Company or the
terms of the transactions contemplated hereby, in advance of such disclosure,
(ii) any disclosure to the Securityholders, (iii) any disclosure to any
representative of any Securityholder who needs to know such information for
the purpose of evaluating the Transaction, and (iv) disclosure by a
Securityholder or any of its Affiliates, that is, in each case, an investment
fund, as part of such Persons ordinary course reporting or review procedure
or to such Persons investors or prospective investors or otherwise in
connection with such Persons ordinary course fundraising, marketing,
information or reporting activities.

 



 

6.2 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notices and Consents_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms hereof, during the period from the date of this
Agreement until the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ "), the Parties shall
each use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) take, or cause to be taken,

Business Days after the execution of this Agreement and shall seek early
termination with respect thereto), and (ii) the applicable antitrust laws of
any other jurisdiction; and (d) execute or deliver any additional instruments
reasonably necessary to consummate the Transactions in accordance with the
terms hereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (x) the failure
to obtain any consent or Order (including those set forth on _Schedule 3.1(c)_
but other than those consents expressly

 



      
 

 



 

required to be obtained on _Schedule 1.8(a)(ix)_ and the HSR Approval) shall
not serve as the basis for the Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 9.1_, and (y) under no circumstances shall the Company or the
Subsidiary be required to make payment to any Person or incur any other
liability to secure such Persons consent, except as set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement.

 



 

(b) The Parties shall cooperate fully with one another to comply as promptly
as practicable with all governmental requirements applicable to the

each other all information concerning the Purchaser, the Target Companies
and/or their respective Affiliates that counsel to the Purchaser and the

(ii) promptly providing the Company and Purchaser with copies of all written
communications to or from any Governmental Entity relating to any competition

to review and incorporate the other Partys reasonable comments in any
communication given by it to any Governmental Entity or in connection with any
proceeding related to the HSR Act or applicable antitrust laws of any other
jurisdiction, and (v) to the extent there are meetings with respect to any
Governmental Entity in connection with requests under the HSR Act or
applicable antitrust laws of any other jurisdiction, permitting each Party to
attend such meetings if so requested by such Party. The Purchaser will pull
and re-file any notice under the HSR Act only if the other Parties agree.

 



 

(c) The Parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve
favorably any review or consideration of the antitrust aspects of the
Transactions by any Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over the enforcement
of any applicable antitrust laws, including by (i) responding promptly to and
complying fully with any request for additional information or documents under
the HSR Act and applicable antitrust laws of any other jurisdiction and (ii)
vigorously defending, through appeal, any Legal Proceeding brought by any
Governmental Entity or other Person seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the
consummation of the Transaction. Nothing in this Agreement shall require the
(1) Company, the Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates to take or agree to
take any action with respect to their business or operations unless the
effectiveness of such agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing and
(2) the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to agree to (i) sell, hold, divest,
discontinue or limit, before or after the Closing, any assets, businesses or
interests of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates; or (ii) any conditions
relating to, or changes or restrictions in, the operations of any such assets,
businesses or interests which, in either case, would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect or materially and adversely impact the
economic or business benefits to Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will promptly notify the
Purchaser in writing of any fact, change, condition, circumstance or
occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event of that will or is reasonably likely
to result in any of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ of this
Agreement to not be satisfied or any other material development affecting

 



      
 

 



 

the ability of the Company or the Sellers to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(a) Each of Blocker Seller and Nautic Partners VIII, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (collectively with the Blocker Sellers, the " _Restricted Parties_
" and each, a " _Restricted Party_ ") hereby agrees that such Restricted Party
will not, and will cause each of such Restricted Partys Affiliates not to,
either alone or in conjunction with any other Person, directly or indirectly,
at any time during the three-year period immediately following the Closing
Date (i) engage, employ, solicit or contact with a view to the engagement or
employment of Len Dino, Albert Thigpen, Janice Forsyth, David Byrne, Tom
Hughes and Evan Raml (each a " _Restricted Employee_ "); _provided_ , that the
foregoing restrictions shall cease as to any Restricted Employee on the date
that is two (2) years following the date such Restricted Employees employment
with the Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable, is
terminated by the Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiary, as applicable,
without cause or (ii) make, publish or communicate to any Person or in any
public forum any defamatory or disparaging remarks, comments or statements

(b) Each Restricted Party will, and will cause such Sellers Representatives
and Affiliates (other than Company) to, keep confidential and not disclose
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser or otherwise use any
Company Information, except as necessary to consummate the Transactions, and
deliver promptly to the Purchaser or destroy, at the request and option of the
Purchaser, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of Company Information
which are in such Restricted Partys possession or under such Restricted
Partys control. If any Restricted Party, based on the written advice of
counsel, is legally compelled to disclose any Company Information to any
governmental tribunal, such Restricted Party may disclose to the governmental
tribunal only the minimum amount of such Company Information as such
Restricted Party is legally compelled to disclose; provided, however, that,
prior to making any such disclosure, such Restricted Party will provide
Purchaser with: (a) prompt written notice of such compulsion so that Purchaser
may seek a protective order or other remedy; and (b) reasonable assistance in
opposing such disclosure or seeking a protective order or other limitations on
disclosure; provided further that such Restricted Party may disclose Company
Information to its current and prospective limited partners which are subject
to confidentiality agreements in a manner consistent with such Restricted
Partys past practices.

 



 

(c) In addition, during the three (3) year period following the Closing, each
Restricted Party will not, and will cause its controlled or commonly
controlled Affiliates (other than their respective portfolio companies) not to
and will not direct any of its or its Affiliates portfolio companies to,
solicit, cause, induce or encourage, or attempt to solicit, cause, induce or
encourage, any of the customers of the Company set forth on _Schedule 6.4(b)_
to use the Business Services of any Person other than the Company or
Purchaser. For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Business Services_ " means
the provision of comprehensive pharmacy benefit management services, which
shall not include other pharmacy services, including without limitation, the
services provided as of the date hereof by ExactCare Pharmacy (whether such
services are provided by ExactCare Pharmacy or any other Person).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) In the event of any breach or violation by any Restricted Party of any of
the covenants in this _Section 6.4_, the time period of such covenant with
respect to such Restricted Party will be tolled and will not run until such
breach or violation is resolved.

 



 

(e) Each Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Restricted
Party is familiar with Companys trade secrets and other Company Information,

the Companys and the Subsidiarys goodwill, in the Company Information and in
preventing unfair competition from current and former stockholders, employees
and agents, (iii) the restrictions contained in this _Section 6.4_ are
reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the
Company and Subsidiary from time to time, including their respective trade
secrets, confidential information, reputation, goodwill and substantial
relationships with specific prospective or existing customers, and constitute
a material inducement to the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby and (iv) in the event of a breach by such Restricted Party
of any of the provisions of this _Section 6.4_, monetary damages may be
inadequate and the Purchaser may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly,
in the event of any such breach, the Purchaser and its successors or assigns
may, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor,
enforce their rights and such Restricted Partys obligations hereunder by any
Legal Proceeding for specific performance, injunctive and/or other relief,
without any requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages or posting
any bond or other security.

 



 

(f) The Purchaser acknowledges that the information provided to it in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions is subject to the terms of
the letter agreement by and between Nautic Partners, LLC on behalf of the
Subsidiary and the Purchaser dated August 22, 2017 (the " _Non-Disclosure and
Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Non-Disclosure and
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. In the event that this Agreement
terminates pursuant to _Section 9.1_, however, the Non-Disclosure and

dispositions of, and/or investments in, whether by way of equity sale, merger,
consolidation or other business combination with any other Person, any equity

(a) _Employment and Benefit Matters_. For the period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, the
Purchaser agrees to maintain, or cause to be maintained, the base compensation
and benefit levels, including base salary, annual incentive opportunities,
retirement and health and welfare benefit plan programs at levels which are,
in the aggregate, substantially similar to those in effect for the Employees
immediately prior to the Closing. The Purchaser, the Surviving Company and
their respective subsidiaries shall treat, and cause the applicable benefit
plans to treat, the service of the Employees with the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company (or their predecessor entities) attributable to any
period before the Closing Date as service rendered to the Purchaser, the
Surviving Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, as applicable, for
purposes of eligibility and vesting under the

 



      
 

 



 

Purchasers, the Surviving Companys or such subsidiarys, as applicable,
severance policy, sick leave, vacation program, health or welfare benefit
plan(s), and such Persons tax-deferred retirement plans, except where credit
would result in duplication of benefits and except where any such benefit plan
is not offered to any such Employee. Without limiting the foregoing, to the
extent that any Employee participates in any group health or other welfare
benefit plan of the Purchaser, Surviving Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries in the one-year period following the Closing Date, (a) the
Purchaser, the Surviving Company or such subsidiary shall cause any pre-
existing conditions or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required
physical examinations under any health or similar welfare plan of the
Purchaser, the Surviving Company or such subsidiary to be waived with respect
to the Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the
corresponding plan in which the Employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and (b) any deductibles, co-pays and maximum out-of-pocket
payments by any such Employee under any of the Companys or its Subsidiarys
health plans in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs shall be
credited towards deductibles, co-pays and maximum out-of-pocket payments under
the health plans of the Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries. The Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Company to, recognize vacation days and paid time off previously accrued and
reserved for by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date. Nothing in
this Section or any other provision of the Agreement shall be interpreted to
obligate the Purchaser or any other entity to continue the employment of any
Employee after the Closing or preclude the ability of Purchaser of any other
entity to terminate the employment of any Employee at any time and for any
reason.

 



 

(b) _401(k) Plan Matters_. If elected by Purchaser in its sole election and
by providing written notice to the Company of such election at least three
business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cause the
Subsidiary to take appropriate and binding corporate action (including any
necessary plan amendment), in a form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser,
to terminate the Leehar Distributors, LLC 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan
effective on a date that precedes the Closing Date, and if such election is
exercised, Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, permit an Employee with an
account balance in such plan (including an outstanding participant loan
balance that is not otherwise in default) to roll over within 90 days of the
Closing Date all or a portion of such account balance into the 401(k) type
defined contribution retirement plan that may be offered by Purchaser to the
Employee after the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) _Limitations_. Purchaser and each Seller acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this _Section 6.7_ are included for the sole benefit
of Purchaser, the Company and the Subsidiary and nothing contained herein

program, (ii) create any third-party beneficiary or other rights in any other
Person, including any employee or former employee of any of Purchaser, the
Company, the Subsidiary, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (iii)
otherwise obligate Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiary, or any of their
respective Affiliates to maintain any particular employee benefit plan or
retain the employment of any particular Employee following the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall pay to the Employees the bonus amounts in respect of the
calendar year ending December 31, 2017 that are accrued in Current Liabilities
as of the Closing within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date.

      
 

 



 

6.8 _Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) The Purchaser agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and exculpation by the Blockers, the Company and the Subsidiary now
existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to
the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer,
director, trustee, manager, member, employee, partner, consultant,
representative, agent, advisor, or unitholder or his, her or its Affiliate, as
applicable, of the Blockers, the Company and the Subsidiary (each, together
with such Persons successors, heirs, executors or administrators, a " _D andO
Indemnified Person_"), as provided in the Governing Documents of such Blocker,
the Company or such Subsidiary, in each case as in effect on the date of such
activities or otherwise in effect on the date of this Agreement, will not be
amended, repealed or modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights of the DandO Indemnified Persons for at least six (6) years after the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that in the event any claim or claims are asserted
or made within such survival period, all such rights to indemnification in
respect of any claim or claims shall continue until final disposition of such
claim or claims.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, or cause the Subsidiary to obtain (the cost of which
will shall be paid on a 50/50 basis by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Sellers, on the other hand) as of the Closing Date, "tail" directors and
officers liability insurance policies with a claims period of six (6) years
from the Closing Date from insurance carriers with at the same or better
claims-paying ability ratings as the Companys current insurance carriers with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance policies, with at
least the same coverage and amounts, and containing terms and conditions that
are not less advantageous to the DandO Indemnified Person, in each case with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred on or
prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with the Transaction).
After the Closing, none of the Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiary or any
of their respective Affiliates will take any action to negate, cancel or
otherwise modify or terminate such "tail" insurance policies.

 



 

(c) The obligations of the Purchaser under this _Section 6.8_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO
Indemnified Person to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies without the consent of
such affected DandO Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the DandO
Indemnified Person to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.8_, each of whom may enforce the provisions
of this _Section 6.8_).

 



 

(d) In the event the Purchaser, the Blockers, the Company, the Subsidiary or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Purchaser, such Blocker, the Company or such Subsidiary, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section
6.8_.

(a) Subject to _Section 6.9(b)_, except pursuant to applicable Law, during
the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will, at the Purchasers expense: (i)

Financing (or satisfaction of any condition to obtaining any portion of the
Financing) less likely to occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of
Purchaser to enforce its rights against any other party to the Financing
Letters, the ability of Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the likelihood of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, at Purchasers sole expense, the Company agrees to
use, and agrees to cause the Subsidiary to use, reasonable best efforts to

pursuant hereto may be shared with the Financing Sources. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary: (A) such
requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or
the ongoing operations of the Company or any of its Affiliates; (B) nothing in
this _Section 6.12_ shall require cooperation to the extent that it would (1)
cause any condition to the Closing set forth in this Agreement to not be
satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement or (2) reasonably be
expected to conflict with or violate the Companys or any of its Affiliates
respective organizational documents or any requirement of law, or result in
the contravention of, or result in a violation or breach of, or default under,
any Material Contract; (C) prior to the Closing, neither the Company nor any
of its Affiliates shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or
incur, or take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in the

the Effective Time; (D) none of the Company or its Affiliates, nor any of
their directors, officers, managers, members, partners or similar Persons,
shall be required to execute or enter into, perform or authorize any agreement
(other than, subject to the limitations specified above, customary
authorization letters) with respect to the Debt Financing that is not
contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Effective
Time; (E) nothing shall obligate the Company to provide, or cause to be
provided, any legal opinion by its counsel, or to provide any information or
take any action to the extent it would result in a violation of applicable Law
and (F) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to take any
corporate actions prior to the Closing to permit the consummation of the Debt
Financing.

 



 

(c) The Company hereby consents to the customary use of its corporate logos in

will not file any such Registration Statement or prospectus to which the

Business Days after the receipt thereof. The comment or objection of the
Securityholder Representative shall be deemed reasonable if such Registration
Statement or prospectus, as proposed to be filed, contains a material
misstatement or omission. Purchaser and the Company shall ensure that the
Registration Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading (provided that each Seller shall be solely responsible for the

writing for inclusion in the Registration Statement and Purchaser and the

information relating to such Sellers and furnished by such Sellers (through
the Securityholder Representative) in writing for inclusion in the
Registration Statement). Purchaser agrees and the applicable Sellers shall
agree (solely as to itself and not with respect to any other Seller), promptly
to correct any information provided by it for use in the Registration
Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and Purchaser further agrees, and the
applicable Sellers shall agree, to take all steps necessary to amend or

30, 2017 and any other annual or quarterly financial statements necessary for
Purchaser to meet its SEC reporting requirements (together the " _Required
Financials_ ") and (ii) Purchaser obtaining an unqualified audit opinion in
accordance with GAAP with respect to such year-end financial statements and
any required auditor consents (together, the " _Audits_ "). The Company shall
promptly respond to any requests for information by the auditor in connection
with the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall reimburse
the Company immediately prior to the Closing for any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Company, Blockers or the Sellers in connection with
complying with the terms of this _Section 6.14_. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Purchaser agrees, subject to the Companys compliance
with this _Section 6.14_, that the Required Financials shall be prepared and

 **ARTICLE VIII _ 
CERTAIN TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

8.1 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall each pay, when due, fifty
percent (50%) any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other similar Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees
and charges (including any penalties and interest but excluding any Taxes
based on or measure by income or gain) incurred in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "). The
Purchaser shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes, and if required by
applicable Law or to the extent reasonably requested, the Sellers shall
cooperate in the preparation and filing and join in the execution of any such
Tax Returns and other documentation.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser shall take such action as may be necessary to cause the
taxable period of each Blocker to end as of the close of business of the
Closing Date for federal income Tax purposes and shall not take or permit any
Target Company to take any action outside the ordinary course of business on
the Closing Date but after the Closing that is not contemplated by this
Agreement and increases the Taxes of any Blocker for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Provided that the Units other than Blocker Units represent at least 50% of
the interests in capital and profits of the Company, on account of which, by
reason of the transfer of such Units to Purchaser in the Merger, the Company
will, on the Closing Date, terminate as a partnership for federal (and, as
applicable, state and local) income Tax purposes under and within the meaning
of Section 708(b)(1)(B) and, in consequence, the taxable year of the Company
will end on the Closing Date, the Securityholder Representative shall have the
right, exercisable by written notice to Purchaser within ten (10) days of the
Closing, to elect to cause to be prepared (at Sellers expense) any income Tax
Returns of the Company and the Subsidiary for taxable periods ending on or
before the Closing Date for which the items of income, deductions, credits,
gains or losses are passed through to Sellers under applicable Law (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, IRS Form 1065). All such income Tax Returns ("
_Pre-Closing Flow-Through Returns_ ") shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practice of the Company and, in any event, applicable Law, and
consistent with the Tax Allocation Schedule (as finally modified). The
Securityholder Representative shall provide Purchaser with a copy of each Pre-
Closing Flow-Through Return at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due
date for filing such Pre-Closing Flow-Through Return (taking into account all
applicable extensions). Purchaser shall have twenty-one (21) days to review
and comment on such Pre-Closing Flow-Through Return, and the Securityholder
Representative shall consider any such comments in good faith. If any such
Pre-Closing Flow-Through Return either (i) requires the signature of any
officer or agent appointed by Purchaser or (ii) reports income or loss
allocable to any Blocker in an amount which will cause such Blocker to owe Tax
in excess of the amount taken into account in the Closing Indebtedness, and,
by the end of such twenty-one (21) day period, Purchaser notifies the
Securityholder Representative in writing of Purchasers disagreement with such
Pre-Closing Flow-Through Return, then Purchaser and Seller shall, during the
ensuing ten (10) days, negotiate in good faith to resolve such disagreement,
failing which such disagreement shall be submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator
for prompt resolution (with the fees of the Neutral Arbitrator to be divided
between Purchaser on the one hand, and Securityholder Representative on the
other hand, consistent with the fee allocation set forth in _Section
2.3(b)(v)_), and the Pre-Closing Flow-Through Return shall be modified as
necessary to comport with the Neutral Arbitrators decision. Securityholder
Representative or (in the case any such Pre-Closing Flow-Through Return
requiring the signature of any officer or agent appointed by Purchaser)
Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account all
applicable extensions) each Pre-Closing Flow-Through Return as prepared
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_, provided that if any disagreement over any
Pre-Closing Flow-Through Return that is subject to the preceding sentence is
not resolved (and such Pre-Closing Flow-Through Return practicably modified as
necessary to conform to the resolution of such disagreement) before the due
date (taking into account applicable extensions) of such Pre-Closing Flow-
Through Return, then Securityholder Representative or (in the case any such
Pre-Closing Flow-Through Return requiring the signature of any officer or
agent appointed by Purchaser) Purchaser shall timely file such Pre-Closing
Flow-Through Return, with any disputed items addressed in the manner which the
party filing such Pre-Closing Flow-Through Return deems correct, subject to
prompt filing of an amended Pre-Closing Flow-Through Return following (and as
necessary to comport with) the resolution of such disagreement (so that such
disagreement does not delay the timely filing of the original Pre-Closing
Flow-Through Return).

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall prepare all Tax Returns of the Target Companies that
required to be filed after the Closing Date for Taxable periods that begin on
or before the Closing Date, other than any Pre-Closing Flow-Through Returns
that Securityholder Representative elects to file under _Section 8.1(c)_ (all
such Tax Returns (other than any Pre-Closing Flow-Through Returns that
Securityholder Representative elects to file), " _Purchaser-Prepared Tax
Returns_ "). All Purchaser-Prepared Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in
a manner consistent with past practice of the Target Companies, except as
required by applicable Law or the other provisions of this Agreement. Prior to
filing any Purchaser-Prepared Tax Return that (i) is not prepared consistent
with past practice of the Target Companies (due to a requirement of applicable
Law or another provision of this Agreement) and (ii) reports any Tax for which
Sellers are liable under this Agreement, Purchaser will permit Securityholder
Representative to review and comment on such Purchaser-Prepared Tax Return,
and shall not file such Purchaser-Prepared Tax Return more than one day prior
to its due date without the consent of the Securityholder Representative,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If, in
accordance with the foregoing, Purchaser files such Purchaser-Prepared Tax
Return without the consent of the Securityholder Representative, and the
Securityholder Representative has notified (or, within ten (10) days of such
filing, notifies) Purchaser in writing of Securityholder Representatives
disagreement with such Purchaser-Prepared Tax Return, then such disagreement
shall be submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator, and such Purchaser-Prepared Tax
Return shall amended if and as necessary to conform to the decision of the
Neutral Arbitrator (whose fees shall be divided between Purchaser on the one
hand, and Seller on the other hand, consistent with the fee allocation set
forth in _Section 2.3(b)(v)_).

 



 

(e) The Securityholder Representative and the Purchaser shall cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection
with the filing of any Tax Returns for the Target Companies, the filing and
prosecution of any Tax claims, and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes of the Target Companies. Such cooperation shall include
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
assistance in the preparation of Tax Returns and additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

exercise such commercially reasonable efforts, the Purchaser may not terminate
this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(d)_ until the expiration of such
thirty (30) day period without such Seller Terminating Breach having been
cured (but in no event shall the preceding proviso be deemed to extend the
Outside Date (as such may be extended pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_) set forth
in _Section 9.1(a)_); or (ii) if satisfaction of any of the conditions set
forth in _Section 7.2_ is or becomes impossible (other than through the
failure of the Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this Agreement);
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Purchaser shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this clause _Section 9.1(d)_ at any time during
which the Purchaser would be unable to satisfy the conditions in _Section
7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ hereof; or

 



 

(e) by the Company: (i) upon a breach of any representation, warranty,

commercially reasonable efforts, and for so long as the Purchaser continues to
exercise such commercially reasonable efforts, the Company may not terminate

9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) The Parties termination rights under _Section 9.1_ are in addition to
any other rights they may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the
exercise of a right of termination hereunder will not be an election of
remedies, except as provided in _Section 9.2(b)_. Subject to _Section
9.2(b)_, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, all
further obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will terminate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if this Agreement is terminated by the
Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, because of the
willful and material breach of this Agreement by the other, the terminating
Partys right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such termination
unimpaired, except to the extent that the Reverse Termination Fee is payable
in connection with such termination; _provided further_ , that the provisions
of _Section 6.1_, this _Section 9.2_ and in _ARTICLE X_ shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_ or _(f)_ or is terminated pursuant
to _Section 9.1(a)_ at a time when the Company is entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to any of _Section 9.1(e)_ or _(f)_ , then the Purchaser
shall pay Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000) in cash (the " _Reverse
Termination Fee_ ") to the Company no later than two (2) Business Days after
such termination, by wire transfer to an account designated by the Company.
The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree (i) that the provisions contained in
this _Section 9.2(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and are included herein in order to induce the Company and
the Blocker Sellers to enter into this Agreement and to reimburse the Company
and the Blocker Sellers for incurring the costs and expenses related to
entering into this Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) that any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section
9.2(b)_ do not constitute a penalty. If the Purchaser fails to pay the Reverse
Termination Fee and the Company commences an action to obtain the Reverse
Termination Fee that results in a judgment against the Purchaser for the
Reverse Termination Fee or any portion thereof, then the Purchaser shall pay
the Companys reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees, expenses and disbursements) incurred in connection with such action,
together with interest on the Reverse Termination Fee at the "prime rate" as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , Eastern Edition, in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date of payment
(calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed, without compounding); provided however, that if such action does
not result in a judgment against Purchaser for payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Purchaser reasonable costs and
expenses

 



      
 

 



 

(including reasonable attorneys fees, expenses and disbursements) incurred in
connection with such action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the parties agree that (1) the Reverse Termination Fee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company, the Securityholder Representative
and the Blocker Sellers and each of their respective Affiliates in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of _Sections 9.1(e)_ or
_(f)_ or is terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ at a time when the
Company is entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any of _Sections
9.1(e)_ or _(f)_. Upon payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, none of
Purchaser, its financing sources, or any of their respective Affiliates or of
any of the foregoing shall have any further liability or obligation relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein or
the Financing Letters whether by or through a claim by or on behalf of a Party
hereto or any other Person (including a claim to enforce the Financing
Letters) or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Purchaser
be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Securityholder
Representative shall have no duties to the Sellers or have any liability to
the Sellers with respect to any action taken or not taken, decision made or
instruction given by the Securityholder Representative in connection with the
Transaction Documents, other than resulting from the Securityholder
Representatives bad faith or willful misconduct.

 



 

(d) The Securityholder Representative shall be indemnified by Sellers for and
shall be held harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the
Securityholder Representative or any of its Affiliates and any of their
respective direct or indirect equityholders, consultants, attorneys,
accountants, brokers or other Representatives, in each case relating to the
Securityholder Representatives conduct as Securityholder Representative,
other than losses, liabilities or expenses resulting from the Securityholder
Representatives bad faith or willful misconduct in connection with its
performance under the Transaction Documents. This indemnification shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. The costs of such indemnification
(including the costs and expenses of enforcing this right of indemnification)
shall be first deducted from the Holdback Account and shall thereafter be
individual obligations of the Sellers in accordance with the Allocation
Statement, which obligations may be satisfied as contemplated by _Section
10.10(f)_. The Securityholder Representative may, in all questions arising
under any Transaction Document, rely on the advice of counsel and for anything
done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Securityholder Representative
in accordance with such advice, the Securityholder Representative shall not be
liable to the Sellers, the Escrow Agent or any other Person. In no event shall
the Securityholder Representative be liable to the Sellers hereunder or in
connection herewith for (i) any indirect, punitive, special or consequential
damages or (ii) any amounts other than those that are satisfied out of the
Holdback Account.

 



 

(e) In the performance of its duties hereunder, the Securityholder
Representative shall be entitled to (i) rely upon any document or instrument
reasonably believed to be genuine, accurate as to content and signed by any
Seller or any Party hereunder and (ii) assume that any Person purporting to
give any notice in accordance with the provisions hereof has been duly
authorized to do so.

 



 

(f) The Securityholder Representative is authorized, in its sole discretion,
to comply with final, nonappealable Orders issued or enacted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Escrow Account and the Holdback
Account. If any portion of the Escrow Amount and/or the Securityholder Expense
Amount is at any time attached, garnished or levied upon under any court
order, or in case the payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery of
any such property shall be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case
any order, judgment

 



      
 

 



 

or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property or any
part thereof, then and in any such event, the Securityholder Representative is
authorized, in its sole discretion, but in good faith, to rely upon and comply
with any such order, writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal
counsel selected by it is binding upon it without the need for appeal or other
action; and if the Securityholder Representative complies with any such order,
writ, judgment or decree, it shall not be liable to any Seller or to any other
Person by reason of such compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or
decree may be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled set aside or vacated.

 



 

(g) The Securityholder Expense Amount shall be withheld from amounts otherwise
payable to the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement at the Closing and
contributed by the Purchaser on behalf of the Sellers to the Holdback Account
as provided in _Section 2.1(b)_, for the Securityholder Representative to
hold on behalf of the Sellers as a fund for any out of pocket fees and
expenses (including legal, accounting and other advisors fees and expenses,
if applicable) incurred by the Securityholder Representative in its capacity
as the Securityholder Representative and as a fund, at the sole discretion of
the Securityholder Representative, to pay any amounts owing to the Purchaser
under this Agreement. All amounts deposited to the Holdback Account shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Sellers
based on the Allocation Statement, and the Purchaser shall have no obligation
to any Seller with respect to the Securityholder Expense Amount or the
Holdback Account. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 10.10_, with respect to any out of pocket fees and expenses
(including legal, accounting and other advisors fees and expenses, if
applicable) incurred by the Securityholder Representative in its capacity as
the Securityholder Representative, the Securityholder Representative shall be
entitled, in its sole discretion, to have each Seller pay such Sellers
respective portion (determined in accordance with the Allocation Statement) of
any out of pocket fees and expenses (including legal, accounting and other
advisors fees and expenses, if applicable) incurred by the Securityholder
Representative in its capacity as the Securityholder Representative, whether
such fees and expenses are paid from any amounts remaining in the Holdback
Account or otherwise. In no event will the Securityholder Representative be
required to advance its own funds or be liable on behalf of the Sellers or
otherwise. The Securityholder Representative shall distribute (or cause to be
distributed) any amounts in the Holdback Account to the Sellers, in accordance
with the Allocation Statement at such time or times as the Securityholder
Representative shall determine in its sole discretion.

 



 

(h) If the Securityholder Representative or its successors or assigns, as the
case may be, advise the Sellers that he, she or it is unavailable to perform
his, her or its duties hereunder, within three (3) Business Days of notice of
such advice, an alternative Securityholder Representative will be appointed by
a majority in interest of the Units and will become effective upon not less
than ten (10) Business Days of prior written notice to Purchaser. Any
references in this Agreement to Securityholder Representative shall be deemed
to include any duly appointed successor Securityholder Representative.

 



 

(i) Purchaser, Merger Sub and Surviving Company will have the right to rely
upon all actions taken or omitted to be taken by Securityholder Representative
pursuant to this Agreement and/or any Transaction Document, all of which
actions or omissions will be legally binding upon Sellers. The grant of
authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest

 



      
 

 



 

and will be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Seller, and (ii) will survive the consummation of the
Merger.

 



 

10.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, such term or provision will be ineffective only to the minimum extent
of such invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such term or
provision or all other terms or other provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

10.12 _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any claim or controversy arising
out of or relating to this Agreement) shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Delaware without regard to conflict of law principles that would
result in the application of any Law other than the laws of the State of
Delaware. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Party
acknowledges and irrevocably agrees that any proceeding, whether in contract
or tort, at law or in equity or otherwise, involving any Financing Source
arising out of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York.

 



 

10.13 _Waiver of Trial by Jury_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.13_.

 



 

10.14 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware),
in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating
thereto, and each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts; (ii) agrees
that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any state
appellate court therefrom; (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware Chancery
or state appellate court; and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware Chancery or state appellate court. Each Party
agrees that (i) this Agreement involves at least $100,000 and (ii) this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement has been entered into by the Parties in express reliance upon 6 Del.
C. § 2708. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section 10.2_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the parties hereto agrees
that it (i) will not bring or support any action or proceeding, cross-claim or
third party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or equity,
whether in contract or tort or otherwise against the Financing Sources arising
out of or relating to this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing, in any forum other than a court of
competent jurisdiction located within the Borough of Manhattan in the City of
New York, New York, whether a state or federal court and (ii) the provisions
of Section 10.13 relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such
action or proceeding, cross-claim or third party claim.

 



 

10.15 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the other Party may be irreparably
damaged in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are
breached. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement and subject to _Section 10.15(b)_, each Party hereby agrees
that the other Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, and to
enforce specifically the performance by such Party under this Agreement,
including without limitation, Purchasers obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby upon satisfaction or waiver by the applicable
party of the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ hereof (except those
conditions that may only be satisfied at the Closing, provided that such
conditions are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur at such
time) and each Party hereby agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that
the other Party has an adequate remedy at law and to interpose no opposition,
legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of injunction or specific performance
as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post any bond in
connection with obtaining such relief. The equitable remedies described in
this _Section 10.15_ shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
remedies at law or in equity that the Parties may elect to pursue.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is
explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance of the Purchasers obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and fund the Transaction Consideration only in the event
that (i) the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _7.2_ have been
satisfied or with respect to _Section 7.2_, waived as of the date of the
Closing should the Closing be consummated pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions
assuming a Closing would occur), (ii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to
the Purchaser in writing that (A) all of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.1_, _Section 7.2_ and _Section 7.3_ have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions assuming a

 



      
 

 



 

Closing would occur), and (B) the Company is prepared to consummate the
Closing, and, regardless of whether the Debt Financing is funded, the Company
stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing, (iii) the Debt
Financing is, or at the Closing, will be funded in accordance with the terms
of the Financing Letters and (iv) Purchaser fails to consummate the Closing
within three Business Days following the receipt of such certification from
the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will the
Company, the Blocker Sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates be
entitled to monetary damages in excess of the Reverse Termination Fee,
specific performance or any other equitable remedies in the event that the
Reverse Termination Fee becomes payable in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, and for the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the Company and/or its Affiliates be entitled to, or
be permitted to seek, specific performance in respect of any Financing Sources
in connection with the Debt Financing. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Section 10.15_, if the Sellers are entitled to seek specific
performance of the Purchasers obligations as set forth in this _Section
10.15_, the Sellers and the Target Companies may seek specific performance of
Purchasers obligations in _Section 6.12(a)_ in connection with the Debt
Financing.

 



 

10.16 _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in
this Agreement, (i) in no event may the Sellers, the Target Companies or any
other Person seek or permit to be sought on behalf of the Sellers, the Company
or any of their Affiliates or any other Person, any damages or any other
recovery or judgment of any kind, in law or in equity, from any Purchaser
Related Party in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, that in no event shall either of Purchaser or
Merger Sub be considered a Purchaser Related Party for purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, and (ii)
the Target Companies and each Seller acknowledge and agree that they have no
right of recovery against, and no personal Liability shall attach to any such
Purchaser Related Party, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or
through a claim by or on behalf of the Sellers or the Target Companies against
Purchaser or any Purchaser Related Party, by the enforcement of any assessment
or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation
or applicable Law in connection with this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall the
Financing Sources have any liability or obligation to Seller, Target Companies
or their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any Financing), whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

 



 

10.17 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. No provision of this Agreement is
intended to or shall be deemed to confer any rights or remedies upon any
Person other than the Parties, except for _Sections_ _10.8_ , _10.12_ ,
_10.13_ , _10.14_ , _10.15_ , _10.16_ and this _10.17_ (in each case, solely
to the extent relating to the Financing Sources) and _Section 6.8_ as set
forth therein.

 



 

10.18 _Cumulative Remedies_. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, all rights and remedies of either Party are cumulative of each
other and of every other right or remedy such Party may otherwise have at law
or in equity, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies shall not
prejudice or impair the concurrent or subsequent exercise of other rights or
remedies.

 



      
 

 



 

10.19 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein (including
_Section 6.2_, _Section 8.1_ and _Section 6.8_ hereof), all costs and
expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and
accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not
the Closing shall have occurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser
shall pay (or reimburse the Company) and be fully responsible for (i) all
filing and other similar fees payable in connection with any filings or
submissions under the HSR Act and any comparable non-U.S. Laws, (ii) fifty
percent (50%) of any fees and expenses charged by the Escrow Agent, and (iii)
all fees and expenses charged by the Paying Agent.

 



 

10.20 _Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that Goodwin Procter
LLP (" _Goodwin_ ") has acted as counsel to the Company, the Subsidiary, the
Blockers, the Blocker Sellers, the Securityholders and the Securityholder
Representative (in its capacity as both the Securityholder Representative and
as a Securityholder) in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and
consummation of the Transaction, and that Goodwin has not acted as counsel for
any other Person in connection with the Transactions and that no other Party
or Person has the status of a client of Goodwin for conflict of interest or
any other purposes as a result thereof.

 



 

(b) The Purchaser hereby consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the
Company and the Subsidiary to consent and agree to, Goodwin representing the
Blocker Sellers, the Securityholder Representative and Securityholders after
the Closing, including with respect to disputes in which the interests of the
Blocker Sellers, the Securityholder Representative and/or the Securityholders
may be directly adverse to the Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Company and the Subsidiary), and even though Goodwin may have represented any
of the Target Companies in a matter substantially related to any such dispute,
or may be handling ongoing matters for the Target Companies.

 



 

(c) In connection with the foregoing, the Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives
and agrees not to assert, and agrees to cause the Company and the Subsidiary
to irrevocably waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising from
or in connection with (a) Goodwins prior representation of the Target
Companies and (b) Goodwins representation of the Blocker Sellers, the
Securityholder Representative and the Securityholders prior to and after the
Closing.

 



 

(d) The Purchaser further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing,
on behalf of the Company and the Subsidiary, that all communications occurring
on or prior to the Closing in any form or format whatsoever between or among
any of Goodwin, Blocker Sellers, the Securityholder Representative, the
Securityholders, the Company, the Subsidiary, or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees or other Representatives that relate in any way
to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute arising under this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Deal Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be retained
and owned by the Blocker Sellers, the Securityholders and controlled by the
Securityholder Representative, and shall not pass to or be claimed by the
Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiary. All Deal Communications that are

 



      
 

 



 

attorney-client privileged (the " _Privileged Deal Communications_ ") shall
remain privileged after the Closing and the privilege and the expectation of
client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to the Blocker Sellers
and the Securityholders and be controlled by the Securityholder Representative
and shall not pass to or be claimed by Purchaser, the Company or the
Subsidiary **.**

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
the Purchaser, the Company or a Subsidiary, on the one hand, and a third party
other than the Blocker Sellers, the Securityholder Representative and/or the
Securityholders, on the other hand, the Purchaser, the Company or such
Subsidiary may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure
of the Privileged Deal Communications to such third party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that none of the Purchaser, the Company or any subsidiary may
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Securityholder
Representative. In the event that the Purchaser, the Company or any subsidiary
is legally required by Order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or
a portion of the Deal Communications, the Purchaser shall immediately (and, in
any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the Securityholder
Representative in writing (including by making specific reference to this
Section) so that the Securityholder Representative can seek a protective order
at its expense and the Purchaser agrees to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to assist therewith.

 



 

(f) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Goodwin
constitute property of its clients, only the Blocker Sellers, the
Securityholders and the Securityholder Representative shall hold such property
rights and Goodwin shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any such files or
other materials or any Deal Communications by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between Goodwin, on the one hand, and a Target Company, on the
other hand.

 



 

(g) Except with respect to post-Closing dispute with a Person that is not a
Seller or a Securityholder Representative or their respective Affiliates and
except as provided in _Section 10.20(e)_, the Purchaser agrees that it will
not, and that it will cause the Company and the Subsidiary not to, (i) access
or use the Deal Communications, including by way of review of any electronic
data, communications or other information, or by seeking to have the
Securityholder Representative waive the attorney-client or other privilege, or
by otherwise asserting that the Purchaser, the Target Companies have the right
to waive the attorney-client or other privilege or (ii) seek to obtain the
Deal Communications from Goodwin. In furtherance of the foregoing, it shall
not be a breach of any provision of this Agreement if prior to the Closing,
the Blocker Sellers, the Securityholders, the Securityholder Representative,
the Blockers, the Company, the Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives takes any action to protect from access or
remove from the premises of the Company or the Subsidiary (or any offsite
back-up or other facilities) any Deal Communications, including without
limitation by segregating, encrypting, copying, deleting, erasing, exporting
or otherwise taking possession of any Deal Communications. In the event that
any copy, backup, image, or other form or version or electronic vestige of any
portion of such Deal Communication remains accessible to or discoverable or
retrievable by the Purchaser, the Company or the Subsidiary (each, a "
_Residual Communication_ "), the Purchaser agrees that it will not, and that
it will cause the Blockers, the Company, the Subsidiary and their respective
directors, officers, employees or other

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives not to use or attempt to use any means to access, retrieve,
restore, recreate, unarchive or otherwise gain access to or view any Residual
Communication in a manner that would be adverse to a Seller or a
Securityholder Representative or their respective Affiliates.

 



 

(h) This _Section 10.18_ shall not be terminated or modified without
Goodwins prior written consent, it being expressly agreed that Goodwin is a
third party beneficiary of this _Section 10.18_.

 



 

10.21 _Time of the Essence_. Time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the
date specified for giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business
Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be given or any
action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then the date for
giving such notice or taking such action (and the expiration date of such
period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be
the next date which is a Business Day.

 



 

10.22 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile, . _pdf_ or other means of electronic
file delivery), each of which when executed shall be deemed an original and
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
