_Agreement_ "), among WellPoint, Inc., an Indiana corporation (" _Purchaser_
"), WellPoint Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned
subsidiary of Purchaser (" _Merger Sub_ ") _,_ and WellChoice, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Company_ ").



WITNESSETH: 



WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors (as defined in Section 8.13(d))
of Purchaser and Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of each
corporation and its shareholders and stockholders, respectively, that
Purchaser and Company engage in a business combination in order to advance
the long-term strategic business interests of Purchaser and Company;



WHEREAS, the combination of Purchaser and Company shall be effected by the
terms of this Agreement through a merger as outlined below;



WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of
Purchaser, Merger Sub and Company have adopted or approved this Agreement,
pursuant to which Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the "
_Merger_ "), with each share of (a) common stock, $0.01 par value, of
Company (" _Common Stock_ ") and (b) Class B common stock, $0.01 par value,
of the Company (" _Class B Common Stock_ ", and, together with the Common
Stock, " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3) (other than (i) Company
Treasury Shares (as defined in Section 1.8(a)), (ii) shares of Company Common
Stock owned by Purchaser or Merger Sub, (iii) Dissenting Shares (as defined
in Section 1.9) and (iv) Subsidiary Held Stock (as defined in Section 1.8(d)))
being converted into the right to receive (x) $38.25 cash, without interest,
and (y) 0.5191 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Purchaser (" _Purchaser Common Stock_ ");



WHEREAS, Purchaser and The New York Public Asset Fund (the " _Fund_ ") will
enter into a Voting Agreement simultaneously herewith (the " _Voting
Agreement_ "), which has been approved by the Board of Directors of Company
for the purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("
_DGCL_ ");



WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the
Merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and that this Agreement shall
constitute a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Sections 354 and
361 of the Code (subject to the election provided for in Section 1.1); and



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows: ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Company shall be merged with
and into Merger Sub at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3). Upon
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Company shall
cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). In lieu of Company being merged with and into
Merger Sub, if all of the conditions set forth in Article VI (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date)
have been satisfied or waived other than the conditions set forth in Section
6.2(h) or 6.3(c) (relating to the receipt of opinions that the Merger is a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code), Purchaser shall have the
right to irrevocably elect (the " _Reverse Merger Election_ ") by notice
delivered to Company, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, to cause the "Merger" to be a merger of Merger Sub
with and into Company at the Effective Time, in which case, following the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Company
shall continue as the Surviving Corporation. The parties agree to amend this
Agreement and any related documents to the extent necessary to provide for
more specific mechanics with respect to the Reverse Merger Election, if made.



1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the closing of the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_
") will take place on the Business Day (as defined in Section 8.13(e)) after
the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions set
forth in Article VI (other than any such conditions which by their terms
cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, which shall be required to be so
satisfied or waived (subject to applicable law) on the Closing Date) unless
another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the actual
time and date of the Closing being referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_
"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of White and Case LLP, 1155 Avenue
of the Americas, New York, New York, unless another place is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto.



1.3 _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the parties shall file a certificate of
merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by and
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective at such time the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such subsequent
time as Purchaser and Company shall agree and as shall be specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being
the " _Effective Time_ ").



1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger will
have the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub
shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of Company and Merger Sub shall be the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.



 

-2- 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time and without any
further action on the part of Company or Merger Sub, the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation,
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.



1.6 _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time and without any further action on the
part of Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger Sub shall be the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended or repealed
as provided therein, in the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation or by applicable law.



1.7 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. The directors of Merger
Sub as of the Effective Time shall serve as directors of the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or
otherwise ceasing to be a director or until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified. The persons designated by the Board
of Directors of Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time shall serve as the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their death,
resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.



1.8 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock:



(a) All shares of Company Common Stock that are held by Company as treasury
stock (the " _Company Treasury Shares_ ") or by Purchaser or Merger Sub shall
be canceled and shall cease to exist and no cash, Purchaser Common Stock or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Company Treasury Shares, (ii)
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Purchaser or Merger Sub, (iii)
Dissenting Shares and (iv) Subsidiary Held Stock) shall be converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive (x) $38.25 in cash, without
interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), and (y) 0.5191 shares of Purchaser
Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Upon such conversion, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each Company
Certificate (as defined in Section 1.10) shall thereafter represent the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, cash for fractional shares in accordance
with Section 2.5 and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
2.3 upon the surrender of the Company Certificate in accordance with the terms
hereof. 



(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and unchanged
following the Effective Time as shares of the Surviving Corporation.



 

(d) Each share of Company Common Stock held by a Subsidiary (as defined in
Section 8.13(n)) (other than Merger Sub) of Purchaser _ ("Subsidiary Held
Stock")_ shall be  



 

-3-  converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock equal to the product of one multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio
(as defined in Section 1.11(a)) _("Subsidiary Stock Consideration")_ and no
Cash Consideration. Upon such conversion, all such shares of Subsidiary Held
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Subsidiary Held Stock
_("Subsidiary Held Certificate")_ shall thereafter represent the right to
receive the Subsidiary Stock Consideration and cash for fractional shares in
accordance with Section 2.5 upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with the terms hereof.



1.9 _Dissenter s Rights_. Notwithstanding Section 1.8(b), any shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a person who has not voted in favor of the Merger and who has properly
demanded in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262
of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration or be entitled to cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock or any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to this Article I unless and until the holder thereof
(" _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to appraisal of such shares
of Company Common Stock held by such holder under Section 262 of the DGCL,
and any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to shares of Company Common
Stock owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. If any Person (as defined in
Section 8.13(l)) who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall
have failed to properly perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
the right to dissent with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, such
shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as though such
shares of Company Common Stock had been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8 hereof. Company shall give
Purchaser (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable law received by Company relating to stockholders rights of
appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for appraisal
under the DGCL. Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Purchaser, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of
Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.



1.10 _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall appoint
EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., or another bank or trust at Purchasers sole
discretion, as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of
exchanging certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
evidenced shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Certificates_ ") for
the Merger Consideration.



1.11  _Company Stock Options and Other Stock Awards_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each employee or director stock option exercisable
for shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stock Options_ ")
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Company or the holders
thereof, be converted automatically into an option to purchase a  



 

-4-  number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock (a " _Converted Option_ ") equal
to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio; _provided_
that any fractional share resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded
down to the nearest whole share. The " _Option Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean
the sum of (i) 0.5191 plus (ii) a fraction the numerator of which is 38.25 and
the denominator of which is the closing trading price of Purchaser Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Inc. (" _NYSE_ "), as reported in the
Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or such other source as the parties
shall agree upon in writing), on the Business Day prior to the Effective Time.
The terms and conditions of the Converted Options shall, subject to
the provisions relating to acceleration of vesting and exercisability set
forth in Section 1.11(f), otherwise remain the same as the terms and
conditions of the Company Stock Options, except that the exercise price per
share of each Converted Option shall equal the exercise price per share of
such Company Stock Option divided by the Option Exchange Ratio; _provided_
that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent.



(b) For purposes hereof, all shares of restricted Company Common Stock (the "
_Company Restricted Stock Awards_ "), together with all other awards of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to vesting or future issuance under any
Company Stock Plan, including without limitation stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock units and deferred stock awards (but not including
Company Stock Options or the Company ESPP (as defined in Section 4.1(b)),
shall be referred to as the " _Other Stock Awards._ " At the Effective Time,
all Other Stock Awards held by employees or directors of Company or its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of Company or the holders
thereof, be converted automatically into a right or award with respect to a
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock (a " _Converted Other Stock Award_
") equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Other Stock Award multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio;
_provided_ that any fractional shares resulting from such multiplication shall
be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The terms and conditions of the
Converted Other Stock Awards shall, subject to the provisions relating to
acceleration of vesting and exercisability and/or lapsing of restrictions set
forth in Section 1.11(f), otherwise remain the same as the terms and
conditions applicable to the Other Stock Awards under the plan and award
agreements pursuant to which such Other Stock Awards were granted as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(c) At the Effective Time, all of the Company Stock Options and Other Stock
Awards shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on
the part of Company or the holders thereof, be assumed in full by Purchaser,
which shall have assumed all plans and agreements pursuant to which a Company
Stock Option or Other Stock Award has been issued (the " _Company Stock Plans_
") as of the Effective Time by virtue of this Agreement and without any
further action by Purchaser. From and after the Effective Time, all references
to Company in the Company Stock Plans and in any agreements granting Company
Stock Options or Other Stock Awards shall be deemed to refer to Purchaser.
Purchaser shall take all actions with respect to the Company Stock Plans, and
the Company Stock Options and Other Stock Awards, that are necessary to
implement the provisions of this Section 1.11, including all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Converted Options or future
issuance under the Converted Other Stock Awards. Purchaser shall take all
actions reasonably necessary to cause the registration of  



 

-5-  the shares of Purchaser Common Stock subject to the Converted Options or
Converted Other Stock Awards to become effective as part of a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not
available, other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Purchaser
Common Stock subject to the Converted Options or Converted Other Stock Awards
promptly, but in any event no later than the Closing Date; and, thereafter,
Purchaser shall deliver or make available to holders of Converted Options or
Converted Other Stock Awards any applicable prospectus and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements, including the current
status of any related prospectus, for so long as the Converted Options or
Converted Other Stock Awards remain outstanding.



(d) Purchaser and Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate
and retain Company Insiders in connection with the Merger, both prior to and
after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be subject
to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended and including all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder ( _the_ " _Exchange Act_ "), to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law in connection with the conversion of Company Common Stock
and other equity securities (i.e., Company Stock Options and Other Stock
Awards) into shares of Purchaser Common Stock, Converted Options and Converted
Other Awards in the Merger and for that compensatory and retentive purpose
agree to the provisions of this Section 1.11(d). The Board of Directors of
Company, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act) thereof, shall adopt a
resolution providing that the disposition by Company Insiders of Company
Common Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration and the disposition by
Company Insiders of Company Stock Options and Other Stock Awards upon
conversion into Converted Options and Converted Other Stock Awards, in each
case, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, are
intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the
Exchange Act. " _Company Insiders_ " shall mean those officers and directors
of Company who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act. In addition, with respect to any director or officer of
Company who at the Effective Time will become a director or officer of
Purchaser subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act, the Board of Directors of Purchaser, or a committee of Non-
Employee Directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)
under the Exchange Act) thereof, shall adopt a resolution providing that the
acquisition by such Persons of Purchaser Common Stock and the acquisition by
such Persons of Converted Options and Converted Other Stock Awards, in each
case, pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, are
intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the
Exchange Act.



(e) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deliver
or cause to be delivered to each holder of Converted Options or
Converted Other Stock Awards an appropriate notice setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to any Company Stock Plans, after giving effect to
the transactions hereunder.



(f) Company, including the Board of Directors of Company and any committee
acting on behalf of Company or the Board of Directors of Company, shall take
all actions necessary to provide for the acceleration of the vesting and
exercisability of, and/or lapsing of restrictions on, all Company Stock
Options and Other Stock Awards, as applicable, as  



 

-6-  of the Effective Time, but shall not otherwise amend, modify or change the
terms of any such Company Stock Options or Other Stock Awards;
_provided, however_ , that no Company Stock Options awarded to Companys
President and Chief Executive Officer and/or Companys "named executive
officers" (as defined in Item 402 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the
Exchange Act) shall be accelerated as to exercisability pursuant to this
Section 1.11(f) and such Company Stock Options shall instead continue to be
exercisable in accordance with their terms.



1.12 _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Purchaser Common Stock or Company Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different
class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-
up, combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable
in any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such
period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the Merger Consideration,
the Option Exchange Ratio and the Subsidiary Stock Consideration shall
be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock,
Company Stock Options and Other Stock Awards the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.



ARTICLE II



EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



2.1 _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, (i) certificates representing the
Purchaser Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.8 (or otherwise shall
make shares of Purchaser Common Stock available for such issuance) and (ii)
cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration to be paid in the
Merger, cash for fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.5 and any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. Purchaser shall make
available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, additional cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5
and any dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. Any cash
and certificates of Purchaser Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent
(or shares of Purchaser Common Stock otherwise made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this Section 2.1) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_." 



2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly, but in any event within ten Business
Days after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a Company Certificate (i) a letter of
transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be
in customary form and have such other provisions as Purchaser may reasonably
specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Company
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Company Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) the number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.8 (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical



 

-7-  certificate is requested) and (B) a check in the amount of the aggregate
Cash Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to Section 1.8 and for the cash that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, including cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 and
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. No interest will
be paid or will accrue on the Cash Consideration or on any cash payable
pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 2.5. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of Company, the proper number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
(which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested) and a check in the amount of the aggregate Cash
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
1.8, the cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3, may be issued and paid
with respect to such Company Common Stock to such a transferee if the Company
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid.



2.3 _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Purchaser Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Company Certificate with respect to the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Company Certificate until such holder shall surrender such
Company Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Company Certificate, there
shall be paid to such holder of shares of Purchaser Common Stock issuable in
exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date prior
to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Purchaser Common
Stock and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Purchaser Common Stock.



2.4 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or Subsidiary Held
Stock_. All shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued and cash paid
upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock or Subsidiary Held Stock in
accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article II (including any cash
paid pursuant to Section 2.3 or 2.5) shall be deemed to have been issued or
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock or Subsidiary Held Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Article II, each Company Certificate or Subsidiary Held Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration or the Subsidiary Stock
Consideration (and any cash to be paid pursuant to Section 2.3 or 2.5), or the
right to the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL pursuant to Section
1.9, as applicable.



 

-8- 2.5 _No Fractional Shares of Purchaser Common Stock_.



(a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
Purchaser Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Company Certificates and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of
a shareholder of Purchaser or a holder of shares of Purchaser Common Stock.



(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or Subsidiary Held Stock exchanged pursuant to
the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Purchaser Common Stock (after taking into account all Company
Certificates or Subsidiary Held Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Purchaser Common Stock
multiplied by (ii) the closing price for a share of Purchaser Common Stock on
the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape on the date of the Effective Time or, if
such date is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately before the date
on which the Effective Time occurs. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Purchaser,
and Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit such amount
with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments
to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the
terms hereof. 



2.6 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Certificates twelve months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Purchaser or otherwise on the
instruction of Purchaser and any holders of the Company Certificates who
have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only
to the Surviving Corporation and Purchaser for the Merger Consideration with
respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8 and Section 2.2, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or
distributions with respect to shares of Purchaser Common Stock to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3.



2.7 _No Liability_. None of Purchaser, Merger Sub, Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.



2.8 _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Purchaser on a daily basis,
or as otherwise agreed to by Purchaser and the Exchange Agent. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to
Purchaser, or as otherwise agreed to by Purchaser and the Exchange Agent.



2.9 _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Company



 

-9-  Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Company Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and
distributions on shares of Purchaser Common Stock deliverable in respect
thereof, in each case, pursuant to this Agreement.



2.10 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Purchaser
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Purchaser, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, as the case
may be, and such amounts shall be delivered by the Surviving Corporation or
Purchaser, as the case may be, to the applicable taxing authority.



2.11 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
managers of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect
or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger.



2.12 _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of Company shall be
closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
thereafter on the records of Company. On or after the Effective Time, any
Company Certificate presented to the Exchange Agent or Purchaser for any
reason shall be converted into the Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to which the holders thereof
are entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or other distributions
to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3.

good faith and fair dealing.



(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser does not, and
the consummation by Purchaser of the Merger and the other transactions

termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
the loss of a material benefit under, or the creation of a Lien on any assets

cancellation or acceleration, loss or creation, is hereinafter referred to as

or for the respective periods set forth therein, all in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (" _GAAP_ ")
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved except as
otherwise noted therein, and subject, in the case of the unaudited interim
financial statements, to normal and recurring adjustments that were not or are

incorporated by reference therein), as of their respective dates (and as of
the date of any amendment to the respective Purchaser SEC Report), complied as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Purchaser in connection with the Share
Issuance, or any of the amendments or supplements thereto (collectively, the
" _Form S-4_") will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, or at
any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or

make the statements therein not misleading, and (B) the proxy statement for
use relating to the adoption by the stockholders of Company of this Agreement,

5.1(b)), contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Form S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder.



(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1(e), no
representation or warranty is made by Purchaser with respect to statements
made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement based
on information not supplied by it or Merger Sub.



 

-13- (f) _Board Approval_. The Board of Directors of Purchaser, by resolutions duly
adopted at a meeting duly called and held and not subsequently rescinded or
modified in any way (the " _Purchaser Board Approval_ "), has unanimously
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger.

the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser.

warrants to Purchaser as follows:

(i) Each of Company and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other
Person duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws

carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in

Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject to
the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Vote (as defined in
Section 3.2(g)). The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Company, subject
to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company Vote. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by Company and, assuming that this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Purchaser and Merger
Sub, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Company, enforceable against
it in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors generally or by general equity principles
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law) or by an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.



(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Company does not, and
the consummation by Company of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, or result in a Violation pursuant
to: (A) any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
Company or any Subsidiary of Company or (B) except as set forth in Section
3.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Company, and subject to obtaining or making the consents, approvals,
orders,  



 

-16-  authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings referred to in
paragraph (iii) below, any loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage,
bond, indenture, lease, benefit plan or other agreement, obligation,

statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Company or any
material Subsidiary of Company or their respective properties or assets.

authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity or expiry of any related waiting period is required by or

Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby in the manner specified in this Agreement and the Voting Agreement
will constitute a transfer of Company Common Stock in violation of the Company
Common Stock ownership restrictions set forth in Article VII of
Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. None of the
execution of this Agreement, the execution of the Voting Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby in the manner
specified in this Agreement and the Voting Agreement will result in any
Person becoming the "Beneficial Owner" (as such term is defined in the
applicable BCBSA License Agreement (as defined in Section 8.13(c))) of a

position and the consolidated results of its operations for the periods

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Company.



(iii) Company has heretofore furnished Purchaser a complete and correct copy
of all material agreements, documents or other instruments required to be, but
which have not yet been, filed with the SEC and any amendments or
modifications which have not yet been filed with the SEC to agreements,

with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder or the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder.

will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, or at any time it is
amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a  



 

-18-  material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (B)
the Proxy Statement will, on the date it is first mailed to Company

misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder.

affect Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and has identified for Companys auditors and the audit committee
of Companys board of directors any material weaknesses in internal control
over financial reporting and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



5.1 _Preparation of Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_.



(a) Company and Purchaser shall prepare and Company shall file with the SEC
the Proxy Statement, and Purchaser shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus and
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement and Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC no later than 30 days
following the date of this Agreement. Each of Purchaser and Company shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (but, in
any event, no more than 3 business days after the SEC notifies Purchaser that
the SEC will consider a written request for the acceleration of the effective
date of the Form S-4). Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as
practicable (but no more than 5 business days) after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Purchaser shall also take any action
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
now so qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state securities
law in connection with the Share Issuance, and Company shall furnish all
information concerning Company and the holders of Company Common Stock and
rights to acquire Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company Stock Plans as
may be reasonably required in connection with any such action. Each of
Purchaser and Company shall furnish all information concerning itself and its
Subsidiaries to the other as may be reasonably requested in connection with
any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4
and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. Each of
Purchaser, Merger Sub and Company agrees to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement that shall have
become false or misleading.



(b) Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, subject to and in
accordance with its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, promptly and
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as soon as practicable (but no
more than 30 days) following the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes
effective a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock (the " _Company
Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of voting to adopt this Agreement,
and except as otherwise provided in the following sentence, (i) shall declare
that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby are advisable and in the best interests of Company and the stockholders
of Company and recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
Company (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and include in the Proxy Statement
such Company Recommendation, (ii) shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit and obtain such adoption and (iii) shall not (A) withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify (or publicly propose to or publicly state that it
intends to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify) in any manner adverse to
Purchaser such recommendation (it being understood that taking a neutral
position or no position with respect to any Alternative Transaction (as
defined in Section 8.13(a)) shall be considered an adverse modification) or
(B) take any other action or make any other public statement inconsistent with
such recommendation (collectively, a " _Change in Company Recommendation_ ").
In the event that prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Company
stockholders (and in no event after the adoption of this Agreement by the
Companys stockholders), the Board of Directors of Company receives a Superior
Proposal (as defined in Section 8.13(o)) without breaching its obligations
under Section 5.5 and the Board of Directors of Company reasonably determines
in good faith by resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside
counsel that the failure to take such action would constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties under Delaware law, the Board of Directors of Company may
effect a Change in Company Recommendation; _provided, however_ , that before
effecting a Change in Company  



 

-40-  Recommendation, it gives Purchaser five business days prior written notice
of its intention to do so (unless at the time such notice is
otherwise required to be given there are less than five business days prior
to the Company Stockholders Meeting, in which case Company shall provide as
much notice as is reasonably practicable) and during such time, Company, if
requested by Purchaser, shall have engaged in good faith negotiations to
amend this Agreement (including by making its officers and its financial and
legal advisors reasonably available to negotiate) such that the Board of
Directors of Company may continue to recommend the adoption of this
Agreement. The parties agree that nothing in this Section 5.1(b) shall in any
way limit or otherwise affect Purchasers right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(c) at such time as the requirements of such
subsection have been met. Any such Change in Company Recommendation shall not
(x) change the approval of this Agreement, the Voting Agreement or any other
approval of the Board of Directors of Company in any respect that would have
the effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover
statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger, or (y) change the
obligation of Company to present this Agreement for adoption at the Company
Stockholders Meeting on the earliest practicable date (but no more than 30
days) after the Form S-4 becomes effective. Notwithstanding any Change in
Company Recommendation, if this Agreement is not otherwise terminated by
either Company or Purchaser in accordance with the terms hereof, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of Company at the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting on adopting this Agreement,
and nothing contained herein, including any rights of Company to take certain
actions pursuant to Section 5.5, shall be deemed to relieve Company of such
obligation. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Company from
(i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) from making
any required disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good
faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Company (after receiving the
advice of its outside counsel), failure to so disclose would constitute a
breach of its obligations under applicable law; _provided_ , that such Rules
and requirements will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any
action pursuant to such Rules or requirements would otherwise have under this
Agreement.



(c) During the term of this Agreement, Company shall not take any actions to
exempt any Person other than Purchaser and Merger Sub from the
threshold restrictions on Company Common Stock ownership or any other
antitakeover provision in Companys certificate of incorporation, or make any
state takeover statute (including any Delaware state takeover statute) or
similar statute inapplicable to any Alternative Transaction.



5.2 _Accountant s Letters_.

delivered to Company a letter from Purchasers independent public accountants,

cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of Purchaser reasonable
access during normal business hours, during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to such of its properties, books, contracts, commitments, records,
officers and employees as Purchaser may reasonably request and, during such
period, Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly
to Purchaser (a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed, published, announced or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state securities laws, as
applicable (other than documents which Company is not permitted to disclose
under applicable law), and (b) consistent with its legal obligations, all
other information concerning it and its business, properties and personnel as
Purchaser may reasonably request; _provided, however,_ that Company may
restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any law, treaty, rule or
regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to Company requires Company
or its Subsidiaries to restrict access to any properties or information.
Purchaser will hold any such information that is non-public in confidence to
the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of that certain
Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 15, 2005, between Purchaser and Company
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Any investigation by Purchaser shall
not affect the representations and warranties of Company.

its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file as promptly
as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary applications,

cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry under the
HSR Act.

that Purchaser shall make as promptly as practicable such filings as are
required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby on its behalf. Purchaser and Company agree that Purchaser shall make

domiciliary insurance regulator of each Subsidiary of Company that is an
insurance company or health maintenance organization, and shall control the

Purchaser and Company shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
provide each other with copies of any written comments and advise the other
party (as defined in Section 8.13(j)) of any oral comments with respect to
the Form A or other regulatory filing from each applicable Governmental
Entity. Purchaser shall control all other regulatory notice filings or
approval requests necessary or desirable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable law relating to the
sharing of information, Purchaser and Company, as the case may be, shall
submit all such filings, requests and hearing testimony, witness lists and
other similar materials relating to any hearing to the other for its review
prior to filing and the substance of each of the foregoing shall be controlled
by Purchaser.



(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 or in any other provision of this
Agreement shall be construed as requiring Purchaser to agree to any terms or
conditions as a condition to, or in connection with, obtaining any Necessary
Consents or any required approval of the BCBSA that would (i) impose any
limitations on Purchasers ownership or operation of all or any portion of its
or Companys, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, businesses or assets,
or compel Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate
all or any portion of its or Companys, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, businesses or assets, (ii) impose any limitations
on the ability of Purchaser to acquire or hold or to exercise full rights of

such terms or conditions as are reasonable and relate to the ordinary course
of business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and that are imposed by a
Governmental Entity with power and authority to grant the Necessary Consents,
and which individually or in the aggregate (A) could have been imposed on the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of September 27, 2005 by such Governmental
Entity in the ordinary course of regulating the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and (B) do not competitively disadvantage Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries or Company or any of its Subsidiaries) (any such term or
condition in (i) through (v) being referred to herein as a " _Burdensome Term
or Condition_ ").

this Agreement, it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and
its Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives

directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate, or furnish
or disclose non-public information in furtherance of, any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer with respect to any Alternative Transaction,
or negotiate, explore or otherwise engage in discussions with any Person
(other than Purchaser, Merger Sub or their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives) with respect to any Alternative
Transaction, or approve, endorse, recommend or authorize any Alternative
Transaction, or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with
respect to any Alternative Transaction or requiring it to abandon, terminate
or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; _provided_ that, at any time prior to the adoption of this
Agreement by Companys stockholders (and in no event after the adoption of
this Agreement by Companys stockholders), Company may furnish information to,
and negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with, any party who delivers
a bona fide written proposal for an Alternative Transaction which was not
solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated after the date of this
Agreement, if and so long as the Board of Directors of Company reasonably
determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted after consultation with
its outside legal counsel that the failure to provide such information or
engage in such negotiations or discussions would constitute a breach of such
Board of Directors fiduciary duties under Delaware law and reasonably
determines in good faith that such a proposal is, or is reasonably likely to
lead to, a Superior Proposal. Company shall notify Purchaser promptly (but in
any event within 24 hours) of any such inquiries, proposals or offers
received by, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or
continued with, Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or its
Subsidiaries representatives, indicating the name of such Person and
providing to Purchaser a summary of the material terms of such proposal or
offer for an Alternative Transaction. Prior to providing any information or
data to, or entering into any negotiations or discussions with, any Person, or
making any such recommendation, in connection with a proposal or offer for an
Alternative Transaction, Company shall receive from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement containing terms and provisions at least as
restrictive as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (which shall
not preclude discussions or negotiations relating to the proposal or offer
from such Person and which shall not contain any exclusivity provision or
other term that would restrict, in any manner, Companys ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Company
agrees that it will keep Purchaser informed, on a prompt basis, of the status
and material terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any
material developments in respect of any such discussions or negotiations and
that it will deliver to Purchaser a summary of any material changes to any
such proposals or offers and all nonpublic information being furnished to such
Person. Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Third
Parties conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any
Alternative Transaction and will not terminate, amend, modify or waive any
provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a
party and shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law,
the provisions of any such agreement, including, but not limited to, by
obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in any court having
jurisdiction.

-45-  Company pursuant to Companys certificate of incorporation, bylaws and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with
any current or former directors, officers and employees of Company and its

acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) and (ii)
purchase as of the Effective Time a tail policy to the current policy of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Company which tail

arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
and which tail policy shall contain substantially the same coverage and
amounts as, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous than, in the

however,_ that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend, for the entire tail policy, in excess of 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by Company for its current policy of directors and officers
liability insurance (which premiums are hereby represented and warranted by
Company to be approximately $7,900,000); and, _provided, further_ that, if the
premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, the
Surviving Corporation after consultation with Company shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.



(b) Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 5.7, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the
Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Person

event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and neither
Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to such Indemnified
Persons for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expense
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Persons in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation elects
not to assume such defense or counsel or the Indemnified Persons advise that
there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Persons, the Indemnified Persons may
retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Purchaser shall and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
for the Indemnified Persons promptly as statements therefor are received;
_provided, however,_ the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to
this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Persons in any jurisdiction, (ii) the Indemnified Persons will cooperate in
the defense of any such matter and (iii) neither Purchaser nor the Surviving

written consent; and _ provided, further,_ that neither Purchaser nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Person if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately
determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Person in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable law.



(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after
the Effective Time) is made  



 

-46-  against any Indemnified Persons on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.7 shall continue in
effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation.



(d) The covenants contained in this Section 5.7 are intended to be for the

respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in

succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.



5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to
Company, to the extent that either acquires actual knowledge of (i) the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which would be reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate and (ii) any failure of
Purchaser, Merger Sub or Company, as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder; _provided, however,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant

take any position inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a

contemplated by this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting to obtain
the Required Company Vote has not occurred and (y) a proposal with respect to
an Alternative Transaction shall have been publicly announced or otherwise
communicated or made known to the senior management or Board of Directors of
Company (or any Third Party shall have publicly announced, communicated or
made known a bona fide intention, whether or not conditional, to make a
proposal with respect to an Alternative Transaction) at any time after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the date of termination of this Agreement;



(iii) Section 7.1(d), and a proposal with respect to an Alternative

and prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting; or



(iv) Section 7.1(g)(i), based on a material breach by Company of Section

an account specified by Purchaser, in the amount of $230,000,000 and (y) in
the case of a termination contemplated by Section 7.3(a)(ii), Section
7.3(a)(iii) or Section 7.3(a)(iv), if, in each case, Company, within twelve

incapable of accurate calculation and that the amounts payable by Company
pursuant to Section 7.3(a) hereof are reasonable forecasts of the actual
damages which may be incurred by Purchaser under such circumstances. The

damages and not a penalty and shall be the sole monetary remedy in the event
of termination of this Agreement on the bases specified in such Section,
except for willful breaches as provided in the proviso in Section 7.2. If
Company fails to pay to Purchaser any amounts due under Section 7.3(a) in
accordance with the terms hereof, Company shall pay the costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of Purchaser in connection
with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action,
taken to collect payment.



(d) Any amounts not paid when due pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall bear
interest from the date such payment is due until the date paid at a
rate equal to five percent.
