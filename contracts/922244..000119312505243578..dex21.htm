A. _The Proposed Transaction_. The parties intend to effect a strategic
business combination through the merger of Main Street with and into BBandT (the
_"Parent Merger"_ ).



B. _Board Determination_. The Board of Directors of BBandT has determined that
the Parent Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are
consistent with and will further BBandTs business strategies and goals and is
in the best interests of its shareholders and, therefore, has approved
the Parent Merger, this Agreement and the plan of merger contained in this
Agreement. The Board of Directors of Main Street, in connection with the
Merger (as defined herein) and the other transactions contemplated herein, has
determined that this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated herein are in the best interests of Main Street and its
shareholders after giving due consideration to all relevant factors, including
the short-term and long-term social and economic interests of the employees,
customers, shareholders and other constituents of Main Street and the Main
Street Subsidiaries, the communities within which Main Street and the Main
Street Subsidiaries operate and the consideration offered by BBandT in relation
to the current value of Main Street available in other freely-negotiated
transactions or in relation to the Main Street Board of Directors estimate of
the future value of Main Street as an independent entity, and therefore,
has approved the Parent Merger, this Agreement and the plan of merger
contained in this Agreement.



C. _Employment and Consulting/Noncompete Agreements_. As an inducement to, and
condition of, BBandTs willingness to enter into this Agreement, as of the date
hereof, (i) Samuel B. Hay, III shall have entered into a five-year
employment/consulting agreement with BBandT (or its specified Subsidiary) and
(ii) Edward C. Milligan and Robert R. Fowler each shall have entered into a
three-year consulting/noncompete agreement with BBandT (or its specified
Subsidiary), each of which shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such persons and the parties hereto and thereto.



D. _Intended Tax Treatment_. The parties intend the Parent Merger to be
treated as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the _"Code"_ )
and intend for this Agreement to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of the Code.

Street shall cease and BBandT shall survive and continue to exist as a North
Carolina corporation (BBandT, as the surviving corporation in the Parent Merger,
sometimes being referred to herein as the  _"Surviving Corporation"_ ). The
BBandT Articles, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, and the BBandT
Bylaws, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the

that no such change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of
consideration to be issued to holders of Main Street Stock as provided for
in Article III of this Agreement (subject to adjustment as provided in
Section 3.05), (ii) adversely affect the tax treatment of Main Streets
shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration, or (iii)
materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



2.02 _The Subsidiary Merger._ At the time specified by BBandT Bank in its
Articles of Merger filed with the North Carolina Secretary of State (which
shall not be earlier than the  



 

7  Effective Time), Bank shall merge with and into BBandT Bank (the " _Subsidiary
Merger_ ") pursuant to an agreement to merge (the " _Agreement to Merge_ ")
to be executed by Bank and BBandT Bank and filed with the North Carolina
Secretary of State and the Georgia Secretary of State, as required. Upon
consummation of the Subsidiary Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Bank shall cease and BBandT Bank shall survive and continue to exist as a North
Carolina state banking corporation. (The Parent Merger and the Subsidiary
Merger shall sometimes collectively be referred to herein as the "
_Merger"_.)



2.03 _Effectiveness of the Parent Merger._ Subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the Parent Merger shall
become effective upon the occurrence of the filing of articles of merger with
the North Carolina Secretary of State in accordance with Section 55-11-05 of
the NCBCA and the filing of articles of merger with the Georgia Secretary of
State in accordance with Sections 14-2-1105 and 14-2-1106 of the GBCC, or such
later date and time as may be set forth in such filings (the time the Merger

waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the closing of the Merger
(the _"Closing"_ ) will take place in the offices of the BBandT Legal Department

11:00 a.m. on (i) the date designated by BBandT that is within thirty (30) days
following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VII, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing (the _"Effective Date"_ ); _provided, however,_ that no such
election shall cause the Effective Date to fall after the date specified in
Section 8.01(c) hereof or after the date or dates on which any Regulatory
Authority approval or any extension thereof expires, or (ii) such other date
to which the parties may agree in writing.



ARTICLE III



Consideration; Exchange Procedures 



3.01 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Parent Merger and without
any action on the part of any Person, each share of Main Street Common Stock
(excluding Company-Owned Stock and shares of Main Street Common Stock held by
BBandT) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into shares of BBandT Common Stock (the _"Merger Consideration"_ )
based upon a fixed exchange ratio of .6602 of a share of BBandT Common Stock
for each share of Main Street Common Stock (subject to adjustment as set forth
in Section 3.05, the _"Stock Exchange Ratio"_ ).



(a) _Company-Owned Stock and Shares Held by BB andT_. Each share of Main Street
Common Stock held as Company-Owned Stock or held by BBandT immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time and no
consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.



 

8 (b) _Outstanding BB andT Common Stock_. Each share of BBandT Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
issued and outstanding and unaffected by the Merger.



3.02 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time, holders
of Main Street Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as,
shareholders of Main Street, other than to receive any dividend or other
distribution with respect to such Main Street Common Stock with a record date
occurring prior to the Effective Time and the consideration provided under
this Article III, and each certificate previously representing any such
shares of Main Street Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive without interest (i) the number of whole shares of BBandT Common
Stock and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of
Main Street Common Stock represented by such certificate have been converted
pursuant to this Article III. After the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of Main Street or the Surviving
Corporation of any shares of Main Street Stock.



3.03 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of BBandT Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor,
or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger;
instead, BBandT shall pay to each holder of Main Street Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of BBandT Common Stock (after taking
into account all Old Certificates (as defined below) delivered by such
holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying such
fractional share of BBandT Common Stock to which the holder would be entitled by
the average of the last sale price of BBandT Common Stock (as reported
on NYSEnet.com or, if not reported thereon, in another authoritative source)
for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the Effective Date.



3.04 _Exchange Procedures_. (a) At or after the Effective Time, BBandT shall
cause BBandT Bank (in such capacity, the _"Exchange Agent"_ ), for the benefit
of the holders of certificates formerly representing shares of Main Street
Common Stock ( _"Old Certificates"_ ), to exchange for outstanding shares of
Main Street Common Stock in accordance with this Article III, certificates
representing shares of BBandT Common Stock ( _"New Certificates"_ ) and an
estimated amount of cash to the extent there are any fractional shares
(together with any dividends or distributions with a record date occurring on
or after the Effective Date with respect thereto without any interest on any
such cash, dividends or distributions).



(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, upon the
shareholders delivery to the Exchange Agent of Old Certificates owned by
such shareholder representing shares of Main Street Common Stock (or an
indemnity affidavit reasonably satisfactory to BBandT and the Exchange Agent, if
any, if such certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed), BBandT shall cause New
Certificates into which such shares of Main Street Common Stock are converted
on the Effective Date to be delivered to such shareholder and/or any check in
respect of cash to be paid as part of the Merger Consideration (in respect of
any fractional share interests, dividends or distributions that such
shareholder shall be entitled to receive). No interest will be paid on any
such cash to be paid in lieu of fractional share interests or in respect of
dividends or distributions that any such shareholder shall be entitled to
receive pursuant to this Article III.



 

9 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any former holder of Main Street Common Stock for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to BBandT Common Stock with
a record date occurring on or after the Effective Date shall be paid to the
record holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate representing shares of Main
Street Common Stock converted in the Merger into the right to receive shares
of such BBandT Common Stock until the holder thereof has delivered properly
endorsed Old Certificates in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 3.04. After becoming so entitled in accordance with this Section 3.04,
the record holder thereof also shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which thereto
for had become payable with respect to shares of BBandT Common Stock on or after
the Effective Date, and which such holder had the right to receive
upon surrender of the Old Certificates.



3.05  _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event BBandT changes the number of
shares of BBandT Common Stock issued and outstanding between the date hereof and
the Effective Date as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, split up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment or similar transaction and the record date therefor shall
be prior to the Effective Date, the Stock Exchange Ratio shall be
proportionately adjusted.



3.06 _Options_. (a) On the Effective Date, whether or not then exercisable,
each outstanding option to purchase shares of Main Street Common Stock under
the Main Street Stock Plans (each, a _"Main Street Stock Option"_ ) shall be
converted into and become rights with respect to BBandT Common Stock, and BBandT
shall assume each Main Street Stock Option in accordance with the terms of the
Main Street Stock Plans, except that from and after the Effective Time (i)
BBandT and its Compensation Committee shall be substituted for Main Street and
the relevant committee of Main Streets Board of Directors for purposes of
administering the Main Street Stock Plans, (ii) each Main Street Stock Option
assumed by BBandT may be exercised solely for shares of BBandT Common Stock,
(iii) the number of shares of BBandT Common Stock subject to each such Main
Street Stock Option shall be the number of whole shares of BBandT Common Stock
(omitting any fractional share) determined by multiplying the number of
shares of Main Street Common Stock subject to such Main Street Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Stock Exchange Ratio, and (iv)
the per share exercise price under each such Main Street Stock Option shall be
adjusted by dividing the per share exercise price under each such Main Street
Stock Option by the Stock Exchange Ratio and rounding up to the nearest cent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, BBandT may, at its election, substitute as of the
Effective Time options under the BBandT Corporation 2004 Stock Incentive Plan
or any other duly adopted comparable plan (in either case, the " _BB andT Option
Plan_") for all or a part of the Main Street Stock Options, subject to the
following conditions: (A) the requirements of (iii) and (iv) above shall be
met; (B) such substitution shall not constitute a modification, extension or
renewal of any of the Main Street Stock Options and shall be tax neutral to
the option holder; and (C) the substituted options shall continue in effect
on the same terms and conditions as provided in the Main Street Stock Option
Agreements and the Main Street Stock Plans governing each Main Street Stock
Option. BBandT shall cause each grant of a converted or substitute option to
any individual who subsequent to the Merger will be a director or officer of
BBandT as construed under Commission Rule 16b-3, as a condition to such  



 

10  conversion or substitution, to be approved in accordance with the provisions
of Rule 16b-3. Each Main Street Stock Option that is an incentive stock
option shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code, and the
Regulations promulgated thereunder, so as to continue as an incentive stock
option under Section 424(a) of the Code, and so as not to constitute a
modification, extension or renewal of the option within the meaning of
Section 424(h) of the Code. Each Main Street Stock Option that is intended to
be exempt from the application of Code Section 409A and related regulations or
other guidance shall be subject to adjustment as necessary in order to comply
with Prop. Reg. §1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D), or any successor provisions thereto.
BBandT and Main Street agree to take all necessary steps to effectuate the
foregoing provisions of this Section 3.06. BBandT has reserved and shall
continue to reserve adequate shares of BBandT Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of any converted or substitute options. Within five business days
after the Effective Time, if BBandT has not already done so, BBandT shall file a
registration statement on Form S-3 or Form S-8 (or any successor or other
appropriate form), as the case may be, with respect to the shares of BBandT
Common Stock subject to converted or substitute options and shall use
its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as such converted or substitute options remain
outstanding. With respect to those individuals, if any, who subsequent to the
Merger may be subject to the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act, BBandT shall administer the Main Street Stock Plans assumed
pursuant to this Section 3.06 (or the BBandT Option Plan, if applicable) in a
manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the
extent necessary to preserve for such individuals the benefits of Rule 16b-3
to the extent such benefits were available to them prior to the Effective
Time. Main Street hereby represents that the Main Street Stock Plans in their
current forms comply with Rule 16b-3 to the extent, if any, required as of the
date hereof.



(b) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, BBandT shall deliver
to the participants receiving converted options under the BBandT Option Plan an
appropriate notice setting forth such participants rights pursuant thereto.



(c) Eligibility to receive stock option grants following the Effective Time
with respect to BBandT Common Stock shall be determined by BBandT in accordance
with its plans and procedures as in effect from time to time, and subject to
any contractual obligations.

in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04 or to one or more of its
respective covenants contained in Article IV and Article VI; _provided,

17  connection therewith by the independent certified public accountants
auditing such financial statements; and (B) its interim unaudited
quarterly financial statements for the quarters beginning after December 31,
2004 and ending on September 30, 2005 (as to each, the _"Last Report Date"_ ).
The documents described in clauses (A) and (B) above (collectively, the
_"Main Street Financial Statements"_ ):



     | 1) | are true, complete and correct; 
---|---|--- 



     | 2) | are in accordance with the books and records of Main Street; 
---|---|--- 



     | 3) | fairly and accurately presents the financial condition of
Main Street as of the dates thereof, and the results of operations for the
periods then ended, as applicable (except in each case as may be noted
therein and subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to
the absence of notes and to normal year-end adjustments that are not material
in amount or in effect); 
---|---|--- 


     | 4) | were prepared on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved; and 
---|---|--- 



     | 5) | have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except in each
case as may be noted therein and subject, in the case of unaudited interim
financial statements, to the absence of notes and to normal year-end audit
adjustments that are not material in amount or effect). 
---|---|--- 



(ii) Neither Main Street nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities that
are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of Main
Street included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal
quarter ended September 30, 2005 (including any notes thereto) and for
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since December 31, 2002 or in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.



(iii) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Main Street and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of Main Street or its Subsidiaries or Main Streets accountants
(including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the system of internal
accounting controls described below in this Section 5.03(g)(iii). Main Street
(A) has implemented and maintains  



 

18  disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 promulgated
under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to
Main Street, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the
management of Main Street by others within those entities, and (B) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Main Streets outside auditors and the audit committee of Main Streets Board
of Directors (y) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely
to adversely affect Main Streets ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (z) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Main
Streets internal control over financial reporting. These disclosures were
made in writing by management to Main Streets auditors and audit committee
and a copy has previously been made available to BBandT. As of the date hereof
and except as Previously Disclosed, there is no reason to believe that Main
Streets outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Sections 302, 404
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification (except to the extent
expressly permitted by such rules and regulations), when next due.



(iv) Since December 31, 2004, (A) through the date hereof, neither Main
Street nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to Main Streets knowledge, any
director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Main
Street or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained
knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether
written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of Main Street or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Main Street or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (B) no attorney
representing Main Street or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed
by Main Street or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Main Street or any of it Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,

(ii) "Material Contracts" shall mean those contracts on Main Streets
Disclosure Schedule listed under Section 5.03(k). All of the Material
Contracts are in full force and effect and are legal, valid, binding and
enforceable in accordance with their terms (A) as to Main Street or any of
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and (B) to the knowledge of Main Street,

conditions and covenants required to be performed by it under the Material

that would give rise to any valid claim against any party hereto for a

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for a fee to be paid to

(m) _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(i) Section 5.03(m)(i) of Main Streets Disclosure Schedule contains a
complete and accurate list of all existing bonus, incentive, deferred
compensation, pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee
stock ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock, stock option,
severance, welfare and fringe benefit plans, employment or severance
agreements and all similar practices, policies and arrangements maintained or
contributed to by Main Street or any of its Subsidiaries and in which
any employee or former employee (the _"Employees"_ ), consultant or former
consultant (the _"Consultants"_ ) or director or former director (the
_"Directors"_ ) of Main Street or any of its Subsidiaries participates or to
which any such Employees, Consultants or Directors are a party (the
_"Compensation and Benefit Plans"_ ). Neither Main Street nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any commitment to create any additional Compensation
and Benefit Plan or to modify or change any existing Compensation and Benefit
Plan, except as otherwise contemplated by Section 4.01(e) of this Agreement.



(ii) Each Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in
all material respects in accordance with its terms and in substantial
compliance with applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the
Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, or any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all
filings, disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and any other
applicable law have been timely made. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan which
is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA (a _"Pension Plan"_ ) and which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
(including a determination that the related trust under such Compensation and
Benefit Plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code) or opinion
letter, as applicable, from the Internal Revenue Service ( _"IRS"_ ), and Main
Street is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of
any such favorable determination letter. There is no material pending or, to
the knowledge of Main Street, threatened legal action, suit or claim relating
to the Compensation and Benefit Plans other than routine claims for benefits
thereunder. To Main Streets knowledge, neither Main Street nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take any action, with
respect to any Compensation and  



 

23  Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject Main Street or any
of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 502 of ERISA, assuming for purposes of Section 4975 of the
Code that the taxable period of any such transaction expired as of the date
hereof.



(iii) None of the Compensation and Benefit Plans is subject to Title IV of
ERISA. No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by Main Street or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of
them, or any single-employer plan of any entity (an _"ERISA Affiliate"_ )
which is considered one employer with Main Street under Section 4001(a)(14) of
ERISA or Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code (an _"ERISA Affiliate Plan"_ ). No
ERISA Affiliate Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA. None of Main Street, any
of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has contributed, or has been
obligated to contribute, to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV
of ERISA at any time since September 26, 1980. To the knowledge of Main
Street, there is no pending investigation or enforcement action by the
Department of Labor or IRS or any other governmental agency with respect to
any Compensation and Benefit Plan.



(iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Compensation
and Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan have been timely made in cash or have
been reflected on the Main Street Financial Statements (as defined in Section
5.03(g)) as of September 30, 2005. Neither any Pension Plan nor any ERISA
Affiliate Plan has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived)
within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.



(v) Neither Main Street nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations to
provide retiree health and life insurance or other retiree death benefits
under any Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by
Section 4980B of the Code. There has been no communication to Employees by
Main Street or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to
promise or guarantee such Employees retiree health or life insurance or other
retiree death benefits on a permanent basis.

 



(vi) Main Street and its Subsidiaries do not maintain any Compensation and
Benefit Plans covering foreign Employees.



(vii) With respect to each Compensation and Benefit Plan, if applicable, Main
Street has provided or made available to BBandT true and complete copies of
existing: (A) Compensation and Benefit Plan documents and amendments thereto;
(B) trust instruments and insurance contracts; (C) two most recently filed
Form 5500s; (D) most recent actuarial report and financial statement; (E) the
most recent summary plan description; (F) all top hat notices filed with the
Department of Labor; (G) most recent determination letter issued by the IRS;
(H) any Form 5310 or Form 5330 filed with the IRS; and (I) most recent  



 

24  nondiscrimination tests performed under ERISA and the Code (including 401(k)
and 401(m) tests).



(viii) Except as disclosed on Section 5.03(m)(viii) of Main Streets
Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement would not, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, as
a result of any termination of employment prior to or following the Effective
Time) reasonably be expected to (A) entitle any Employee, Consultant or
Director to any payment (including severance pay or similar compensation) or
any increase in compensation, (B) result in the vesting or acceleration of
any benefits under any Compensation and Benefit Plan or (C) result in any
material increase in benefits payable under any Compensation and Benefit Plan.



(ix) Neither Main Street nor any of its Subsidiaries maintains any
compensation plans, programs or arrangements the payments under which would
not reasonably be expected to be deductible as a result of the limitations
under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder.



 

(x) Except as disclosed on Section 5.03(m)(x) of Main Streets Disclosure
Schedule, as a result, directly or indirectly, of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, as a result of
any termination of employment prior to or following the Effective Time), none
of BBandT, Main Street or the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries will be obligated to make a payment that would be characterized
as an "excess parachute payment" to an individual who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code) of Main
Street on a consolidated basis, without regard to whether such payment is
reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be performed in
the future.



(xi) Section 5.03(m)(xi) of Main Streets Disclosure Schedule identifies each
Compensation and Benefit Plan that is or has ever been a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Code Section 409A and
associated Treasury Department guidance, including IRS Notice 2005-1 and
Proposed Treasury Regulations Sections 1.409A-1 _et seq._ (collectively "
_409A_ ") (each such plan a " _NQDC Plan_ "). Except as provided in Section
5.03(m)(xi) of Main Streets Disclosure Schedule, each NQDC Plan has been
operated, notwithstanding any terms to the contrary, in good faith compliance
with 409A, to the extent required under 409A.



(n) _Labor Matters_. Neither Main Street nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or
other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor
is Main Street or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding
asserting that it or any such Subsidiary has committed an unfair
labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or
seeking to compel Main Street or any such Subsidiary to bargain with any labor
organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike
or other labor dispute involving it or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to
Main Streets  



 

25  knowledge, threatened, nor is Main Street aware of any activity involving
its or any of its Subsidiaries employees seeking to certify a
collective bargaining unit or engaging in other organizational activity.

"affiliate transaction", "business combination" or other anti takeover laws
and regulations of any state (collectively, _"Takeover Laws"_ ) applicable to
it, including, without limitation, the State of Georgia. Main Street has taken
all action required to be taken by it in order to make this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby comply with, and this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby do comply with, the requirements of any

provisions (collectively, the _"Takeover Provisions"_ ).



(p) _Environmental Matters_. Except as Previously Disclosed, to Main Streets
knowledge, neither the conduct nor operation of Main Street or its
Subsidiaries nor any condition of any property presently or previously owned,
leased or operated by any of them (including, without limitation, in
a fiduciary or agency capacity), or on which any of them holds a Lien,
violates or violated Environmental Laws and to Main Streets knowledge, no
condition has existed or event has occurred with respect to any of them or any
such property that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, is
reasonably likely to result in liability under Environmental Laws. Neither
Main Street nor any of its Subsidiaries has used or stored any Hazardous
Material in, on, or at any property presently or previously owned, leased or
operated by any of them in violation of any Environmental Law. To Main
Streets knowledge, neither Main Street nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice from any Person that Main Street or its Subsidiaries or
the operation or condition of any property ever owned, leased, operated, or
held as collateral or in a fiduciary capacity by any of them are or were in
violation of or otherwise are alleged to have liability under any
Environmental Law, including, but not limited to, responsibility (or
potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other remediation of any
pollutants, contaminants, or hazardous or toxic wastes, substances or
materials at, on, beneath, or originating from any such property. Neither
Main Street nor any of its Subsidiaries is the subject of any action, claim,
litigation, dispute, investigation or other proceeding with respect to
violations of, or liability under, any Environmental Law. Main Street and each
of its Subsidiaries has timely filed all reports and notifications required

previously owned, leased or operated by any of them and has generated and

ended on or before December 31, 2004. Neither Main Street nor any of its

Schedule), were entered into by Main Street or Main Streets Subsidiaries (i)
in accordance with prudent business practices and all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and regulatory policies and (ii) with counterparties believed to
be financially responsible at the time; and each of them constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligation of Main Street or one of its Subsidiaries,
enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors rights or by general equity principles), and is in full

after such date, except (i) statutory liens for amounts not  



 

28  yet due and payable, (ii) pledges to secure deposits and other liens
incurred in the ordinary course of banking business, (iii) such
imperfections of title, easements, encumbrances, liens, charges, defaults or
equitable interests, if any, as do not affect the use of properties or assets
subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business
operations at such properties, (iv) dispositions and encumbrances in the
ordinary course of business, and (v) liens on properties acquired in
foreclosure or on account of debts previously contracted. All leases pursuant
to which Main Street or any of its Subsidiaries, as lessee, leases real or
personal property (except for leases that have expired by their terms or that
Main Street or any such Subsidiary has agreed to terminate since the date
hereof) are valid without default thereunder by the lessee or, to
Main Streets knowledge, the lessor.



(z)  _Loans_. Each loan reflected as an asset in the Main Street Financial
Statements (as defined in Section 5.03(g)) and each balance sheet date
subsequent thereto (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of
indebtedness that are true, genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to the

not a party to a loan, including any loan guaranty, with any director,
executive officer or 5% shareholder of Main Street or any of its Subsidiaries
or any Person controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of
the foregoing. All loans and extensions of credit that have been made by Bank
that are subject either to Section 22(b) of the Federal Reserve Act, as
amended, or to Part 349 of the rules and regulations promulgated by the FDIC,
comply therewith.



(aa) _Allowance for Loan Losses_. The allowance for loan losses reflected on
the Main Street Financial Statements (as defined in Section 5.03(g)), as of
their respective dates, is adequate in all material respects under
the requirements of GAAP to provide for reasonably incurred losses on
outstanding loans.



(bb) _Repurchase Agreements_. With respect to all agreements pursuant to which
Main Street or any of its Subsidiaries has purchased securities subject to an
agreement to resell, if any, Main Street or such Subsidiary, as the case may

ownership in book entry form of the government securities or other collateral

to such Part are accurate.



(ee) _Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC and Customer
Information_. Main Street is not aware of, has not been advised of, and has no
reason to believe that any facts or circumstances exist, which would cause it
or any of its Subsidiaries to be deemed (i) to be operating in violation
in any material respect of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, any order
issued with respect to anti-money laundering by the U.S. Department of the
Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other applicable anti-
money laundering statute, rule or regulation; or (ii) not to be in
satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the applicable privacy
and customer information requirements contained in any federal and state
privacy laws and regulations, including, without limitation, in Title V of

It is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause it to believe
that any non-public customer information has been disclosed to or accessed by
an unauthorized third party in a manner that would cause it or any of its
Subsidiaries to undertake any material remedial action. The Main Street Board
(or, where appropriate, the board of directors of any of Main
Streets Subsidiaries) has adopted and implemented an anti-money laundering
program that contains adequate and appropriate customer identification
verification procedures that comply with Section 326 of the Patriot Act and
such anti-money laundering program meets the requirements in all material
respects of Section 352 of the Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder, and

with any requirements to file reports and other necessary documents as
required by the Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder.

Covenants



6.01 _Reasonable Best Efforts._ Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Main Street and BBandT agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable
under applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as  



 

33  promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall cooperate fully with the other
party hereto to that end.



6.02 _Shareholder Approval._ Main Street agrees to take, in accordance with
applicable law and the Main Street Articles and Main Street Bylaws, all action
necessary to convene an appropriate meeting of its shareholders to consider
and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and any other matters required
to be approved or adopted by Main Streets shareholders for consummation of
the Merger (including any adjournment or postponement, the _"Main Street
Meeting"_ ), as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective. The Main Street Board shall recommend that its
shareholders adopt this Agreement at the Main Street Meeting unless the Main
Street Board, after consultation with independent legal counsel, determines in
good faith that it is probable that such recommendation would be a breach of
its fiduciary duties under applicable Georgia law and Main Streets Articles.



6.03 _Registration Statement._ (a) BBandT agrees to prepare, pursuant to all
applicable laws, rules and regulations, a registration statement on Form S-4
(the _"Registration Statement"_ ) to be filed by BBandT with the SEC in
connection with the issuance of BBandT Common Stock in the Merger (including the
proxy statement and prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of Main
Street constituting a part thereof (the _"Proxy Statement"_ ) and all related
documents). Main Street agrees to cooperate, and to cause its Subsidiaries to
cooperate, with BBandT, its counsel and its accountants, in preparation of the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement; and provided that Main Street
and its Subsidiaries have cooperated as required above, BBandT agrees to file
the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement (together, the
_"Proxy/Prospectus"_ ) with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable.
Each of Main Street and BBandT agrees to use all reasonable efforts to cause the
Proxy/Prospectus to be declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after filing thereof. BBandT also agrees to
use all reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date of the
Registration Statement, all necessary state securities law or "Blue
Sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Main Street agrees to furnish to BBandT all
information concerning Main Street, its Subsidiaries, officers, directors and
shareholders as may be reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing.



(b) Each of Main Street and BBandT agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will, at the time
the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) the
Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to the Main Street shareholders and at the time of the Main Street
Meeting, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading or any statement which, in the
light of the circumstances under which such statement is made, will be false
or misleading with respect to any material fact, or which will omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false
or misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier statement
in the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto. Each of Main
Street and BBandT further agrees that if it shall become aware prior to the
Effective Date of any information furnished by it  



 

34  that would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement to be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take the
necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement.



(c) BBandT agrees to advise Main Street, promptly after BBandT receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order
or the suspension of the qualification of BBandT Common Stock for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for
any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement
of the Registration Statement or for additional information.



6.04 _Press Releases._ Each of Main Street and BBandT agrees that it will not,
without the prior approval of the other party, issue any press release or
written statement for general circulation relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, except as otherwise required by applicable law or
regulation, or NYSE or NASDAQ rules.



6.05 _Access; Information._ (a) Each party agrees that upon reasonable notice
and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, it
shall afford the other party and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants
and other authorized representatives, such access during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the
books, records (including, without limitation, tax returns and work papers of
independent auditors), properties, personnel and to such other information as
the other party may reasonably request and, during such period, (i) each
party shall furnish promptly to the other party all information concerning the
business, properties and personnel of a party as the other party may
reasonably request, and (ii) Main Street shall furnish promptly to BBandT a
copy of each material report, schedule and other document filed by Main Street
pursuant to any federal or state securities or banking laws. Neither party
shall be required to provide access to the other party or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of a partys customers, jeopardize any attorney-client privilege or
contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty
or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.



(b) Each of BBandT and Main Street agrees that it will not, and will cause its
representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section
6.05 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof in
connection with the entering into of this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Subject to the requirements of law, each party will keep confidential, and
will cause its representatives to keep confidential, all information and
documents obtained pursuant to this Section 6.05 (as well as any other
information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with the entering
into of this Agreement) unless such information (i) was already known to such
party, (ii) becomes available to such party from other sources not known by
such party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is disclosed
with the prior written approval of the party to which such information
pertains or (iv) is or becomes readily ascertainable from published
information or trade sources. No investigation by either party of the business
and affairs of the other shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any
representation, warranty,  



 

35  covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the conditions to either partys
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 



(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
Main Street shall promptly furnish BBandT with copies of all monthly and other
interim financial statements produced in the ordinary course of business as
the same shall become available.



6.06 _Acquisition Proposals._ Main Street agrees that it shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents,
advisors and affiliates not to, solicit or encourage inquiries or proposals
with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide
any confidential information to, or have any discussions with, any Person
relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, except to the extent that the Main
Street Board, after consultation with independent legal counsel, determines in
good faith that it is probable that the failure to take such action would be
a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Georgia law and Main
Streets Articles. It shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the date of this
Agreement with any parties other than BBandT with respect to any of the
foregoing (except as permitted by the immediately preceding sentence) and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or
similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Main Street shall
promptly advise BBandT following the receipt by Main Street of any Acquisition
Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal), and advise BBandT of any material
developments with respect to such Acquisition Proposal promptly upon the
occurrence thereof.



6.07 _Affiliate Agreements._ Not later than the 15th day prior to the mailing
of the Proxy Statement, Main Street shall deliver to BBandT a schedule of each
Person that, to the best of its knowledge, is or is reasonably likely to be,
as of the date of the Main Street Meeting, deemed to be an "affiliate" of Main
Street (each, a _"Main Street Affiliate"_ ) as that term is used in Rule 145
under the Securities Act. Main Street shall cause each Person who may be
deemed to be a Main Street Affiliate to execute and deliver to Main Street on
or before the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement an agreement in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_. Main Street shall deliver such executed
affiliate agreements to BBandT at the Closing.



6.08 _Takeover Laws._ No party hereto shall take any action that would cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them shall take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or, if necessary, challenge
the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or
hereafter in effect. Neither party will take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated hereby not to comply with any Takeover
Provisions and each of them will take all necessary steps within its control
to make those transactions comply with (or continue to comply with) the
Takeover Provisions.



 

6.09 _Reports._ Each of Main Street and BBandT shall file (and shall cause Main
Streets Subsidiaries and BBandTs Subsidiaries, respectively, to file),
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, all reports
required to be filed by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission and any
other Regulatory Authorities having jurisdiction over such party, and Main
Street shall deliver to BBandT copies of all such reports promptly after the
same are filed. If  



 

36  financial statements are contained in any such reports filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, such financial statements will fairly
present the consolidated financial position of the entity filing such
statements as of the dates indicated and the consolidated results of
operations, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for the periods
then ended in accordance with GAAP (subject in the case of interim financial
statements to the absence of notes and to normal recurring year-end
adjustments that are not material). As of their respective dates, such reports
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission will comply in all material
respects with the Federal securities laws and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Any financial
statements contained in any reports to a Regulatory Authority shall be
prepared in accordance with requirements applicable to such reports.



6.10 _Exchange Listing_. BBandT will use all reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of BBandT Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, as promptly as
practicable, and in any event before the Effective Time.



6.11 _Regulatory Applications._ (a) BBandT and Main Street and their respective
Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts
to prepare all documentation, to timely effect all filings and to obtain all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental and Regulatory Authorities necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto agrees that it
will consult with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all
material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental and Regulatory Authorities necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will
keep the other party apprised of the status of material matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.



(b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary
or advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or
on behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party or
Governmental Authority.



6.12 _Indemnification._ (a) Following the Effective Date, BBandT shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless all directors, officers and employees of
Main Street and its Subsidiaries (each, an _"Indemnified Party"_ ) against all
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions or
alleged actions or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) to the fullest extent that Main Street is permitted to indemnify
(and advance expenses to) its directors, officers and employees under the laws
of the State of Georgia, the Main Street Articles and the Main Street Bylaws
as in effect on the date hereof.



 

37 (b) For a period of three years from the expiration of the current term of the
policy, BBandT shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide that portion of
directors and officers liability insurance that serves to reimburse the
present and former officers and directors of Main Street or any of its
Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims
against such directors and officers arising from facts or events that occurred
before the Effective Time, on terms no less favorable than those in effect on
the date hereof; _provided, however_ , that BBandT may substitute therefor
policies providing at least comparable coverage containing terms and
conditions no less favorable than those in effect on the date hereof; and
_provided, further_ , that officers and directors of Main Street or any
Subsidiary may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to BBandTs insurance carrier for the purpose of
obtaining such insurance; and _provided, further_ , in no event shall the
annual premium on such policy exceed 110% of the annual premium payments on
Main Streets policy in effect as of the date hereof (the _"Maximum Amount"_
). If the amount of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure such
insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, BBandT shall use its reasonable
efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and officers
liability insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.



(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.12(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, shall promptly notify BBandT thereof; provided that the failure
so to notify shall not affect the obligations of BBandT under Section 6.12(a)
unless and to the extent that BBandT is actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure.



(d) If BBandT or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to any entity, then and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of BBandT shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.12.



6.13 _Employment and Consulting/Noncompete Agreements; 401(k) Plan; Other
Employee Benefits._ (a) As of the date hereof, BBandT (or its specified
Subsidiary) shall enter into a five-year employment/consulting agreement with
Samuel B. Hay, III (" _Employment/Consulting Agreement"_ ) and three-year
consulting/noncompete agreements with each of Edward C. Milligan and Robert R.
Fowler (collectively, the _"Consulting/Noncompete Agreements"_ ), each of
which shall become effective on the Effective Date if the Closing occurs as
provided in Section 2.04 of this Agreement. Additionally, BBandT (or its
specified Subsidiary) will offer a three-year employment/consulting agreement
to Max S. Crowe (the  _"Employment Agreement"_ ), which, if accepted, shall
be executed and become effective on the Effective Date. Furthermore, BBandT will
offer at-will employment after the Effective Date to David W. Brooks, II, John
T. Monroe, Gary Austin and Richard Blair, provided such offers of at-will
employment will not entitle them to any severance pay if such person receives
termination compensation pursuant to their then existing employment agreements
as listed on Schedule 6.13(a). Each of the existing employment agreements
listed on Schedule 6.13(a) shall be terminated at a time, which shall be
agreed upon by Main Street and BBandT, and each employee shall receive any
payments that such employee is entitled to receive under such existing
employment agreement.



 

38 (b) Effective on the Benefit Plan Determination Date with respect to the
401(k) plan of Main Street, BBandT shall cause such plan to be merged with the
BBandT Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan (the _"BB andT 401(k) Plan"_), or to be
frozen or to be terminated, in each case as determined by BBandT and subject to
and conditional upon the receipt of all applicable regulatory or governmental
approvals. Each employee of Main Street at the Effective Time (i) who is a
participant in the 401(k) plan of Main Street, (ii) who becomes an employee of
BBandT or of any of its Subsidiaries (the _"Employer Entity"_ ) immediately
following the Effective Time, and (iii) who continues in the employment of an
Employer Entity until the Benefit Plan Determination Date for the 401(k) plan,
shall be eligible to make salary reduction contributions under the BBandT
401(k) Plan as of the Benefit Plan Determination Date. Any other employee of
Main Street who is employed by an Employer Entity on or after the Benefit Plan
Determination Date shall be eligible to be a participant in the BBandT 401(k)
Plan upon complying with eligibility requirements. All rights to participate
in the BBandT 401(k) Plan are subject to BBandTs right to amend or terminate such
plan. Until the Benefit Plan Determination Date, BBandT shall continue in
effect for the benefit of participating employees the 401(k) plan of Main
Street. For purposes of administering the BBandT 401(k) Plan, service with Main
Street and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be service with BBandT for
participation and vesting purposes, but not for purposes of benefit accrual.
Any compensation earned and deferred by employees of Main Street in the
calendar year of the Benefit Plan Determination Date will be recognized by
BBandT in the administration of the BBandT 401(k) Plan. If employees of Main
Street were eligible to receive a matching contribution under the 401(k) plan
of Main Street, then such Main Street employees will be eligible to receive
any matching contribution provided under the BBandT 401(k) Plan. If employees
of Main Street were not eligible to receive a matching contribution under the
401(k) plan of Main Street, then such Main Street employees must meet the
matching contribution eligibility requirements under the BBandT 401(k) Plan
before receiving any matching contribution under the BBandT 401(k) Plan. Each
employee of Main Street or its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time who becomes
an employee immediately following the Effective Time of an Employer Entity is
referred to here as a _"Transferred Employee."_ Transferred Employees shall be
included in any defined benefit plan sponsored or maintained by any Employer
Entity following the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of such
plan; _provided, however_ , such Transferred Employees shall receive credit
for service with Main Street and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor
entities to the extent such service was recognized by Main Street) prior to
the Effective Time for purposes of participation, eligibility and vesting (but
not for purposes of benefit accrual) under such defined benefit plan to the
same extent as if such service were with the Employer Entity. 



(c) Each Transferred Employee shall be eligible to participate in group
hospitalization, medical, dental, life, disability and other welfare benefit
plans and programs available to similarly situated employees of the Employer
Entity, subject to the terms of such plans and programs, as of the Benefit
Plan Determination Date for each such plan or program, conditional upon the
Transferred Employees being employed by an Employer Entity as of such Benefit
Plan Determination Date and subject to complying with eligibility requirements
of the respective plans and programs after taking into account the service
crediting and other provisions set forth below. With respect to any welfare
benefit plan or program of Main Street that the Employer Entity determines, in
its sole discretion, provides benefits of the same type or class as a
corresponding plan or program maintained by an Employer Entity, the Employer
Entity shall continue such Main Street plan or program in effect for the
benefit of the Transferred Employees  



 

39  so long as they remain eligible to participate and until they shall become
eligible to become participants in the corresponding plan or program
maintained by the Employer Entity (and, with respect to any such plan or
program, subject to complying with eligibility requirements and subject to the
right of the Employer Entity to terminate such plan or program). For purposes
of administering the welfare plans and programs subject to this Section 6.13,
service with Main Street shall be deemed to be service with the Employer
Entity for the purpose of determining eligibility to participate, vesting (if
applicable), benefit accruals (solely for purposes of vacation and service
awards), commencement of benefits and benefit subsidies in such welfare plans
and programs. From and after the Effective Time (or the Benefit Plan
Determination Date, as applicable), BBandT shall, or shall cause another
Employer Entity to (i) reduce any pre-existing conditions or limitations and
eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans of an Employer Entity
by applying the creditable coverage as described under the provisions of
HIPAA with respect to the Transferred Employees, and (ii) give each
Transferred Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or
the Benefit Plan Determination Date, as applicable) occurs towards applicable
deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to
the Effective Time (or the Benefit Plan Determination Date, as applicable).
The provisions of this Section 6.13 shall apply equally to the eligible
dependents of a Transferred Employee. 



(d) Except to the extent of commitments herein or other contractual
commitments, if any, of Main Street prior to the date hereof and of BBandT in
separate agreements, neither BBandT nor any Employer Entity shall have any
obligation arising from the Merger to continue any Transferred Employees in
its employ or in any specific job or to provide to any Transferred Employee
any specified level of compensation or any incentive payments, benefits or
perquisites. Each Transferred Employee who is terminated by an Employer Entity
following the Effective Time, excluding any employee who has a then existing
contract explicitly providing for severance pay or other termination pay,
shall be entitled to severance pay in accordance with the severance plan
listed on Schedule 6.13(d). Each Transferred Employees service with Main
Street and Main Street Subsidiaries (or any predecessor entities to the extent
such service was recognized by Main Street) shall be treated as service with
BBandT for purposes of determining the amount of severance pay, if any, under
such severance plan.



(e) BBandT agrees to honor all employment agreements, consulting agreements,
severance agreements and deferred compensation agreements that Main Street and
its Subsidiaries have with their current and former employees and directors
and which have been Previously Disclosed to BBandT pursuant to this Agreement,
except to the extent any such agreements shall be superseded or terminated at
the Closing or following the Effective Date. Except for the agreements
described in the preceding sentence and except as otherwise provided in this
Section 6.13, the employee benefit plans of Main Street shall, in the sole
discretion of BBandT, be frozen, terminated or merged into comparable plans of
BBandT, effective as BBandT shall determine in its sole discretion.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, BBandT will continue in
effect any short-term bonus or incentive plans of Main Street (the _"Main
Street Bonus Arrangements"_ ) until the earlier of (i) the date of completion
of conversion of the data services systems of Main Street and its Subsidiaries
to the data service systems of BBandT and its Subsidiaries, or (ii) the date
that former Main Street executives are made parties to the BBandT Amended and
Restated Short Term Incentive Plan (the _"BB andT Bonus Plan"_). If any former
executive of Main Street would earn amounts under both the Main Street Bonus
 



 

40  Arrangements and the BBandT Bonus Plan for any calendar year, BBandT shall make
appropriate adjustments in the amounts earned under such programs to avoid
duplication and to pro-rate the amount earned by such executive under the Main
Street Bonus Arrangements and the BBandT Bonus Plan for the portion of the year
in which such executive participated in each such plan.



6.14 _Notification of Certain Matters._ Each of Main Street and BBandT shall
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any
Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute
a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein.



6.15 _Dividend Coordination._ It is agreed by the parties hereto that they
will cooperate to assure that as a result of the Merger, during any
applicable period, there shall not be a payment of both a BBandT and a Main
Street dividend to a shareholder of Main Street for the same period. The
parties further agree that if the Effective Date is at the end of a fiscal
quarter, then they will cooperate to assure that the Main Street shareholders
receive the dividend declared by BBandT, if any, rather than the dividend for
that period, if any, declared by Main Street.



6.16 _Board Representation; Advisory Board._ BBandT shall cause the BBandT Bank
Board of Directors to elect Robert R. Fowler to the BBandT Bank Board of
Directors, and Edward C. Milligan to the BBandT Georgia State Board. BBandT will
pay compensation to Mr. Fowler and Mr. Milligan for their respective service
on such boards consistent with BBandTs fee policies for service on such boards.
Each of the remaining current members of the Main Street Board and Main
Streets community local advisory board will be asked to serve on a BBandT
local advisory board for the region formerly served by Main Street (for such
period of time as determined by BBandT) and BBandT will pay compensation to such
directors for their service on such BBandT local advisory board as indicated on
Section 6.16 of Main Streets Disclosure Schedule for a period of two years
after the Effective Date. After the expiration of such two-year period and in
the event such director continues to serve on such local advisory board, BBandT
will pay compensation to such directors for their service on such BBandT local
advisory board consistent with BBandTs fee policies for advisory board members.
Any board member who agrees to serve on such BBandT local advisory board shall
enter into a two-year noncompete agreement, which shall commence on the
Effective Date.



6.17 _Tax Treatment._ Each of BBandT and Main Street agrees not to take any
actions subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would adversely affect
the ability of Main Street and its shareholders to characterize the Merger as
a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, and each of BBandT
and Main Street agrees to take such action as may be reasonably required, if
such action may be reasonably taken to reverse the impact of any past actions
that would adversely impact the ability for the Merger to be characterized as
a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.



6.18 _No Breaches of Representations and Warranties._ Between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, without the written consent of the
other party, each of BBandT and Main Street will not do any act or suffer any
omission of any nature whatsoever that would  



 

41  cause any of the representations or warranties made in Article V of this
Agreement to become untrue or incorrect in any material respect.



6.19 _Consents._ Each of BBandT and Main Street shall use its best efforts to
obtain any required consents to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



6.20 _Insurance Coverage._ Main Street shall cause each of the policies of
insurance listed in its Disclosure Schedule to remain in effect between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Date.



6.21 _Correction of Information._ Each of BBandT and Main Street shall promptly
correct and supplement any information furnished under this Agreement so that
such information shall be correct and complete in all material respects at
all times through the Closing, and shall include all facts necessary to make
such information correct and complete in all material respects at all times,
provided that any such correction that may result in a change to a
partys Disclosure Schedule shall not be made without the prior written
consent of the other party.



6.22 _Confidentiality._ Except for the use of information in connection with
the Registration Statement described in Section 6.03 hereof and any other
governmental filings required in order to complete the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or as required in order to comply with
applicable law, order or rules of any national securities exchange or market
where each partys respective securities are traded, all
information (collectively, the _"Information"_ ) received by each of Main
Street and BBandT, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be kept in
strictest confidence; _provided that_ , subsequent to the filing of the
Registration Statement with the SEC, this Section 6.22 shall not apply to
information included in the Registration Statement or to be included in the
official Proxy/Prospectus to be sent to the shareholders of Main Street under
Section 6.03. Main Street and BBandT agree that the Information will be used
only for the purpose of completing the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Main Street and BBandT agree to hold the Information in strictest
confidence and shall not use, and shall not disclose directly or indirectly
any of such Information except when, after and to the extent such Information
(i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than through the
failure of Main Street or BBandT to fulfill its obligations hereunder, (ii) was
already known to the party receiving the Information on a nonconfidential
basis prior to the disclosure or (iii) is subsequently disclosed to the party
receiving the Information on a nonconfidential basis by a third party having
no obligation of confidentiality to the party disclosing the Information. It
is agreed and understood that the obligations of Main Street and BBandT
contained in this Section 6.22 shall survive the Closing.

(a) _Mutual Consent._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, by the mutual
consent of BBandT and Main Street.



 

44 (b) _Breach._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, by BBandT or Main Street
in the event of either: (i) a breach by the other party of any representation
or warranty contained herein (subject to the standard set forth in Section
5.02), which breach cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after the
giving of written notice to the breaching party of such breach; or (ii) a
material breach by the other party of any of the covenants or agreements
contained herein, which breach cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days
after the giving of written notice to the breaching party of such breach,
_provided that_ (A) such breach (under either clause (i) or (ii)) would
entitle the non-breaching party not to consummate the Merger under Article
VII, and (B) the terminating party is not itself in material breach of any
provision of this Agreement.



(c) _Delay._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, by BBandT or Main Street,
if its Board of Directors so determines by vote of a majority of the members
of its entire Board, in the event that the Merger is not consummated by July
1, 2006, except to the extent that the failure of the Merger then to be
consummated arises out of or results from the knowing action or inaction of
the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this Section 8.01(c). 



(d) _No Approval._ By Main Street or BBandT in the event (i) the approval of
any Governmental Authority required for consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have been denied by
final nonappealable action of such Governmental Authority; (ii) the Main
Street shareholders fail to adopt this Agreement at the Main Street Meeting
and approve the Merger; or (iii) any of the closing conditions have not been
met as required by Article VII hereof.



(e) _Adverse Action._ By BBandT, if (i) the Main Street Board submits this
Agreement (or the plan of merger contained herein) to its shareholders without
a recommendation for approval or with any adverse conditions on, or
qualifications of, such recommendation for approval; or (ii) the Main Street
Board otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or discloses
its intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its
recommendation referred to in Section 6.02; or (iii) the Main Street Board
recommends to its shareholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.



8.02 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment; Enforcement of Agreement._ In the
event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger
pursuant to this Article VIII, no party to this Agreement shall have any
liability or further obligation to any other party hereunder except (i) as set
forth in Sections 8.03 and 9.01; and (ii) that termination will not relieve a
breaching party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement
giving rise to such termination. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage will occur in
the event that a party breaches any of its obligations, duties, covenants
and agreements contained herein. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any
state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled by law or in equity.



 

45 8.03 _Termination Fee._ Main Street shall pay to BBandT a termination fee in the
amount of Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) if:



(a) (i) this Agreement is terminated by BBandT pursuant to Section 8.01(b) or
8.01(e) or by BBandT or Main Street pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii); and (ii)
prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
Main Street was commenced, publicly proposed or publicly disclosed; and (iii)
within 12 months after such termination, Main Street shall have entered into a
definitive written agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any
Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated; _or_



(b) after receiving an Acquisition Proposal, the Main Street Board does not
take action to convene the Main Street Meeting and/or recommend that Main
Street shareholders adopt this Agreement; and within 12 months after such
receipt, Main Street shall have entered into a definitive written agreement
relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any Acquisition Proposal shall have
been consummated; _provided, however_ , that BBandT shall not be entitled to a
termination fee pursuant to this Section 8.03(b) in the event that this
Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(a) or Section
8.01(d)(i).



Upon payment of the fee described in this Section 8.03, Main Street shall have
no further liability to BBandT at law or in equity with respect to such
termination under Section 8.01(b), 8.01(d)(ii) or 8.01(e), or with respect to
the Main Street Boards failure to take action to convene the Main Street
Meeting and/or recommend that Main Street shareholders adopt this Agreement.
Main Street acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.03
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, BBandT would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if Main Street fails to pay timely any amount due pursuant to
this Section 8.03 and, in order to obtain such payment, BBandT commences a suit
that results in a judgment against Main Street for the amount payable to BBandT
pursuant to this Section 8.03, Main Street shall pay to BBandT its reasonable
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amount so payable at the applicable
Federal Funds rate.

_Form of Main Street Affiliate Agreement_



_ _, 2006



BBandT Corporation

200 West Second Street

Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27101



Ladies and Gentlemen:



I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Main Street Banks, Inc. ("Main Street"), as that term is
defined for purposes of Paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and
Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "Act").



Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between BBandT
Corporation ("BBandT") and Main Street dated as of December 14, 2005 (the
"Merger Agreement"), providing for the merger of Main Street with and into
BBandT (the "Merger"), and as a result of the Merger, I may receive shares of
BBandT common stock ("BBandT Common Shares") in exchange for shares of Main Street
common stock ("Main Street Stock") owned by me at the Effective Time (as
defined and determined pursuant to the Merger Agreement). This letter is being
delivered pursuant to Section 6.07 of the Merger Agreement. I represent and
warrant to BBandT that in such event:



A. I will not sell, assign or transfer the BBandT Common Shares that I receive
as aforesaid in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.



B. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and have
discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability
to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the BBandT Common Shares, to the
extent I feel necessary, with my counsel or counsel for Main Street. I
understand that BBandT is relying on the representations I am making in this
letter and I hereby agree to hold harmless and indemnify BBandT and its
officers and directors from and against any losses, claims, damages, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), or liabilities ("Losses") to which
BBandT or any officer or director of BBandT may become subject under the Act or
otherwise as a result of the untruth, breach, or failure of such
representations.



 

A-1 C. I have been advised that the issuance of the BBandT Common Shares issued to
me pursuant to the Merger will have been registered with the Commission under
the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been
advised that since I may be deemed to be an affiliate under the Rules and
Regulations at the time the Merger was submitted for a vote of the
shareholders of Main Street, that the BBandT Common Shares must be held by me
indefinitely unless (i) my subsequent distribution of BBandT Common Shares has
been registered under the Act; (ii) a sale of the BBandT Common Shares is made
in conformity with the volume and other applicable limitations of a
transaction permitted by Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act
and as to which BBandT has received satisfactory evidence of the compliance and
conformity with said Rule, or (iii) a transaction in which, in the opinion of
counsel reasonably acceptable to BBandT or in accordance with a no-action letter
from the Commission, some other exemption from registration is available with
respect to any such proposed sale, transfer or other disposition of the BBandT
Common Shares.



D. I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to BBandTs
transfer agent with respect to any BBandT Common Shares which I receive in the
Merger and that there will be placed on the certificates for such BBandT Common
Shares, a legend stating in substance:



"The shares represented by this certificate have been issued or transferred to
the registered holder as a result of a transaction to which Rule 145 under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), applies. The shares
represented by this certificate may not be sold, transferred or assigned, and
the issuer shall not be required to give effect to any attempted sale,
transfer or assignment, except pursuant to (i) an effective registration
statement under the Act, (ii) a transaction permitted by Rule 145 and as to
which the issuer has received reasonable and satisfactory evidence of
compliance with the provisions of Rule 145, or (iii) a transaction in which,
in the opinion of counsel satisfactory to the issuer or in accordance with a
"no action" letter from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
such shares are not required to be registered under the Act."



 

A-2 It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth in Paragraph D above
shall be removed and any stop order instructions with respect thereto shall
be canceled upon receipt of advice from counsel satisfactory to BBandT that such
actions are appropriate under the then-existing circumstances.
