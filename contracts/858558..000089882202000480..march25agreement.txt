calculated pursuant to clause (1) or (2) above, and expressed as a positive or
negative number, as the case may be, the "INITIAL AMOUNT"), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by RP in writing at least 2
business days prior to the Closing Date; provided, that of such amount, $10
million (the "ESCROW AMOUNT") shall be paid (and RP hereby directs that such
amount be paid) into escrow (the "ESCROW") to an escrow agent mutually
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and RP (the "ESCROW AGENT") and distributed in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement attached as
Exhibit A hereto (the "ESCROW AGREEMENT").

     (b) Buyer and RP acknowledge that the Purchase Price to be paid to RP
pursuant to Section 3.1(a) reflects a reduction in the amount of RP's deferred
subscription revenue liability existing at Closing, and that a portion of the
Assets in an amount equal to such deferred subscription revenue liability at
Closing is being transferred to Buyer as compensation for assuming and
fulfilling the Deferred Subscription Obligations including such deferred
subscription revenue liability.

     3.2 NET ASSETS ADJUSTMENT. (a) Not less than five business days prior to
the Closing Date, the Chief Financial Officer of RP shall deliver to Buyer (1)
an estimated balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date and without
giving effect to the Closing (the "ESTIMATED CLOSING BALANCE SHEET") and (2) a
certificate (the "NET ASSETS DIFFERENTIAL CERTIFICATE") which shall (in a form
of reasonable detail and with appropriate backup illustrating the calculation
thereof) set forth a good faith estimate, based on the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet and expressed as a positive or a negative number, as the case may be, of
the amount of the Final Net Assets Differential (the "ESTIMATED NET ASSETS
DIFFERENTIAL"). The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the preparation of the audited balance sheets of RP as of
December 31, 2000 and 2001 included in the Audited RP Financial Statements and
the calculation of Closing Net Assets shall be prepared therefrom consistent
with the determination of Baseline Net Assets as set forth in Schedule 3.2(a).
Buyer shall be given reasonable access


                                     -16-
<PAGE>

during normal business hours to the books and records of RP and reasonably
permitted to review the working papers of RP relating to the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet and the Net Assets Differential Certificate a reasonable period
prior to the fifth business day prior to the Closing. RP shall use reasonable
efforts to revise the Net Assets Differential Certificate and the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet to the extent Buyer and RP agree to the existence of
errors therein. Within 15 business days after Closing, RP shall deliver to Buyer
a balance sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date but without giving effect
to the Closing (the "CLOSING BALANCE SHEET") and a schedule, based on the
Closing Balance Sheet, setting forth the Closing Net Assets. The Closing Balance
Sheet shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the preparation of the
audited balance sheets of RP as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 and included in
the Audited RP Financial Statements, and the calculation of Closing Net Assets
shall be prepared therefrom consistent with the determination of Baseline Net
Assets set forth on Schedule 3.2(a).

     (b) Within 45 days of delivery to Buyer of the Closing Balance Sheet, Ernst
& Young shall audit the Closing Balance Sheet (together with the schedule
setting forth the Closing Net Assets). In connection with such audit, KPMG LLP
shall review the work papers of Ernst & Young. All items in the schedule setting
forth the Closing Net Assets delivered with the Closing Balance Sheet the
amounts of which are not objected to or questioned by RP or Buyer during the
14-day period following completion of the audit of the Closing Balance Sheet by
Ernst & Young shall be deemed agreed upon by RP and Buyer and shall be deemed
conclusive for purposes of determining the Final Closing Net Assets.

     (c) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 14 days after completion
of the audit of the Closing Balance Sheet and the schedule setting forth the
Closing Net Assets, RP and Buyer shall attempt to resolve any items comprising
Closing Net Assets as to which RP and Buyer differ (the "DISPUTED ITEMS"). If
during such 14-day period RP and Buyer are able to resolve all Disputed Items,
the Closing Net Assets so agreed upon shall be the "FINAL CLOSING NET ASSETS."

     (d) If during such 14-day period any such Disputed Items cannot be
resolved, those items to the extent of the amounts agreed upon by RP and Buyer
shall be deemed agreed upon, shall no longer constitute Disputed Items and shall
be conclusive for purposes of determining the Final Closing Net Assets, and each
of RP and Buyer shall promptly but in no event more than 14 days thereafter
cause Deloitte & Touche LLP (or another accounting firm of internationally
recognized standing) reasonably satisfactory to them promptly to review this
Agreement and the remaining Disputed Items for purposes of resolving the
remaining Disputed Items and calculating the Final Closing Net Assets. In making
such calculation, such accounting firm shall make a determination only of
Disputed Items not resolved by RP and Buyer and, in the case of all other items,
shall use the amounts which are agreed upon by RP and Buyer. Such accounting
firm shall deliver to RP and Buyer, as promptly as practicable, a report setting
forth its resolution of the remaining Disputed Items and its calculation of
Closing Net Assets. Such report shall be final and binding upon the parties
hereto. The cost of such review and report shall be borne by the party against
whom the disagreement is in large part resolved or, if the resolution does not
substantially favor either RP or Buyer, such costs shall be borne equally by RP
and Buyer. In all events, such accounting firm will determine the assessment of
such costs.


                                     -17-

     (e) The Closing Net Assets agreed to by RP and Buyer or as calculated by
the accounting firm as set forth in Section 3.2(d) shall be the "FINAL CLOSING
NET ASSETS," which shall be conclusive for all purposes of this Agreement.

     (f) (1) If the Final Net Assets Differential is positive or zero, then this
clause (f)(1) shall apply and the "CASE 1 FINAL AMOUNT" shall be the difference
of (A) the greater of (x) the Final Net Assets Differential minus $6 million and
(y) zero minus (B) the Initial Amount. If the Case 1 Final Amount is a positive
number, then Buyer shall make payment of the Case 1 Final Amount to an account
or accounts designated by RP by wire transfer in immediately available funds. If
the Case 1 Final Amount is a negative number, then RP shall make payment of the
absolute value of the Case 1 Final Amount to an account or accounts designated
by Buyer by wire transfer in immediately available funds. If the Case 1 Final
Amount is zero, then there shall be no additional payment.

          (2) If the Final Net Assets Differential is negative, then this clause
(f)(2) shall apply and the "CASE 2 FINAL AMOUNT" shall be the difference of (A)
the lesser of (x) the Final Net Assets Differential plus $6 million and (y) zero
minus (B) the Initial Amount (the "CASE 2 FINAL AMOUNT"). If the Case 2 Final
Amount is a positive number, then Buyer shall make payment of the Case 2 Final
Amount to an account or accounts designated by RP by wire transfer in
immediately available funds. If the Case 2 Final Amount is a negative number,
then RP shall make payment of the absolute value of the Case 2 Final Amount to
an account or accounts designated by Buyer by wire transfer in immediately
available funds. If the Case 2 Final Amount is zero, then there shall be no
additional payment.

          (3) Any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.2(f) shall be paid
(1) within 5 business days after Buyer and RP agree upon the Final Closing Net
Assets pursuant to Section 3.2(c) or (2) if Disputed Items are referred to
Deloitte & Touche (or other firm of independent accountants) pursuant to Section
3.2(d), then within 5 business days after the delivery of the report of such
firm referred to in Section 3.2(d).

     (g) Any payment pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall be made by causing such
payments to be credited in immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated by the party receiving such payment. The amount of any payment to be
made pursuant to this Section 3.2(g) shall bear interest from and including the
Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to
the Prime Rate as published by The Chase Manhattan Bank. Such interest shall be
payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days for which interest is due.

     (h) Each RP Equityholder will pay to Buyer immediately its Designated
Proportion of any amount due to Buyer pursuant to this Section 3.2 which RP
cannot or does not pay within the period specified herein.

     3.3 ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS AND OTHER AMOUNTS. (a) If any Asset or the Business
shall suffer any damage, destruction or loss after the date hereof, but before
the Closing Date, and such Asset or the Business and the related casualty are
covered by any insurance policy maintained by any Member of the RP Group, then
RP shall as soon as practicable repair, restore


                                     -18-
<PAGE>

or replace such Asset, or, if time does not permit so repairing, restoring or
replacing, pay to Buyer in cash, the amount of the proceeds from such policy
covering such damage, destruction or loss. In the event of the repair,
restoration or replacement of such Asset, the calculation of Adjusted Assets
will take into account the book value of the Asset so repaired or restored or
the replacement Asset and will take into account the loss of the damaged,
destroyed or lost Asset. If such Asset is not replaced, the amount of cash paid
to Buyer (regardless of when paid) shall be considered an Asset for purposes of
Adjusted Assets (and the Final Net Assets Differential shall be recalculated if
necessary) and the calculation of the Adjusted Assets will take into account the
loss of the damaged, destroyed or lost Asset.

     (b) All proceeds of insurance which are applicable to insured claims of
third parties included in the Assumed Liabilities and are received by any Member
of the RP Group after Closing shall (1) be used to discharge, in whole or in
part, the applicable Assumed Liabilities, (2) be paid to Buyer if, and to the
extent that, such Assumed Liabilities have been discharged by Buyer or Buyer has
made a reimbursement to RP in respect of such claim or (3) be retained by RP if,
and to the extent that, such Assumed Liabilities have been discharged by any
Member of the RP Group and Buyer has not made a reimbursement to RP in respect
of such claim. The amount of any cash paid to Buyer (regardless of when paid)
pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall be considered an Asset for purposes of
Adjusted Assets (and the Final Net Assets Differential shall be recalculated if
necessary).

     (c) From and after the Closing, RP shall promptly (1) pay to Buyer all
monies received in respect of direct mail and newsstand sales, payments for
accounts receivable and all other amounts (in whatever form received, together
with any required endorsements) to the extent relating to, arising out of or in
connection with the Business, the Assets or the Assumed Liabilities received by
any Member of the RP Group and (2) deliver to Buyer all purchase or other orders
and subscriptions received by any Member of the RP Group.

                                   ARTICLE IV
         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF RP AND, SOLELY WITH RESPECT
                     TO SECTION 4.26, EACH RP EQUITYHOLDER

its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Each Member of the RP Group is duly qualified and in good standing to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated
by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification
necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the failure to be duly qualified
and in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a RP Material Adverse Effect.

than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which
have been asserted or instituted, and, to RP's knowledge, no set of
circumstances exists which may reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim or

Business Permits. In the event that any Listed Contract, Lease, other Contract
constituting an Asset, Business Permit or other Asset is not transferable to
Buyer, RP shall, and shall cause the other Members of the RP Group to, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such Listed Contract, Lease, other
Contract, Business Permit or other Asset for the benefit of Buyer (including the
benefit of enforcement of any rights of any Member of the RP Group against any
third party thereto arising out of breach or cancellation by the third party
thereto or otherwise), or otherwise make arrangements reasonably requested by
Buyer designed to provide to Buyer such benefit; provided, that Buyer shall be
responsible for performing RP's obligations under any such Listed Contract,
Lease, other Contract or Business Permit or with respect to such other Asset.

     6.15 LOCATION OF BUSINESS. Buyer agrees that, unless otherwise agreed to by
RP or the RP Equityholders' Agent, for a period extending until December 1,
2008, the headquarters of the


                                     -43-
<PAGE>

businesses conducted by the RP Group and to be acquired by Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement will continue to be housed at RP's current corporate headquarters
at 5400 South 60th Street, Greendale, Wisconsin; provided, that Buyer may,
without any prior approval, relocate such headquarters to another location
within or in the immediate vicinity of Greendale, Wisconsin as Buyer may deem
necessary and prudent in the event of any material casualty to the current
headquarters or to accommodate the growth of the businesses being acquired from
RP.

     6.16 BULK SALES LAWS. RP and Buyer agree that any applicable bulk sales
laws need not be complied with in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

     6.17 FINANCING. Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
secure as promptly as practicable the financing required to pay the Purchase
Price and otherwise satisfy its obligations hereunder consistent with the terms
set forth in the Commitment Letter heretofore delivered to RP (to the extent so
set forth; it being understood that Buyer shall not be required to agree to
specific provisions in the definitive credit agreement which have not been set
forth in reasonable detail in the Commitment Letter to the extent doing so would
not then be commercially reasonable).

                                  ARTICLE VII
                 BUSINESS EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS

     7.1 BUSINESS EMPLOYEES. For purposes of this Agreement, "BUSINESS
EMPLOYEES" are hereby defined as those individuals whose names are set forth on
Schedule 7.1 and who fall within one of the following categories:

     (a) individuals actively employed by RP or any Member of the RP Group in
the Business immediately before Closing;

     (b) employees of any Member of the RP Group who are (1) absent from work
with the Business on account of sickness or leave of absence at Closing and (2)
released to return to work (and actually return to work) their regularly
scheduled number of hours within 12 weeks from the day such employee left active
employment or commenced working a reduced schedule (such circumstances,
"EMPLOYMENT LEAVE"); or

     (c) employees of any Member of the RP Group who would not otherwise be
employed in the Business immediately before the Closing but who, with the mutual
consent of RP and Buyer, become employees of the Business at or before the
Closing.

     7.2 OFFERS OF EMPLOYMENT. Each Member of the RP Group shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to retain all Business Employees, in each case
from the date hereof through the Closing Date, and to assist Buyer in hiring the
Business Employees offered employment pursuant to this Section 7.2. Buyer shall
offer to employ each Business Employee, including each individual on Employment
Leave who presents himself for employment with the Buyer within 45 days of the
Closing Date, on such terms and conditions as Buyer shall determine, consistent
with the provisions of this Article VII, including a condition that the Business
Employees waive any severance that may be payable. Buyer shall thereafter
deliver to RP a list of Business Employees who have accepted offers of
employment with Buyer, and individuals on Employment Leave who have presented
themselves for employment with the


                                     -44-
<PAGE>

Buyer within such 45-day period. The time at which the employment by Buyer of
each Business Employee who accepts such offers of employment shall become
effective shall be the Closing, and the effective time of the employment of any
individual on Employment Leave will be the day such employee presents himself or
herself for employment and commences employment with Buyer within such 45-day
period (if any). Those Business Employees who accept such offers of employment
shall be referred to herein as the "TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES." Buyer agrees to
retain for employment all Transferred Employees for a period of at least ninety
(90) days following the Closing Date (or provide such employees with notice and
pay through the end of such 90-day period), unless Buyer shall have just cause
to terminate the employment of any particular Transferred Employee during such
90-day period. From the date hereof through the Closing, each Member of the RP
Group shall permit Buyer to communicate and meet with the Business Employees, at
reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, concerning Buyer's plans,
operations, business, customer relations and general personnel matters and to
review the personnel records and such other information concerning the Business
Employees as Buyer may reasonably request.

     7.3 ASSUMPTION OF EMPLOYEE PLANS. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall
assume all of the assets and liabilities of, or with respect to, the Employee
Plans and the related trusts. Buyer and each Member of the RP Group agree to
cooperate with each other prior to Closing in order to assure a smooth
transition and assumption of the Employee Plans as provided for hereunder.
Assets and liabilities relating to, or in connection with, the Employee Plans
shall be reflected, and accrued for, on the Closing Balance Sheet consistent
with the manner of preparation required in Section 3.2. For purposes of clarity,
the Equity Plan Agreements are explicitly not being assumed by Buyer hereunder,
and Buyer shall have no Liability for any such Equity Plan Agreements.

     7.4 PENSION AND WELFARE BENEFITS. Buyer agrees that for a period of one
year following the Closing, Buyer shall provide Transferred Employees with
pension and welfare benefits under the Employee Plans, or, if Buyer terminates
or amends such Employee Plans within such one-year period, with pension and
welfare benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
provided to the Transferred Employees under the Employee Plans as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer presently intends to convert
participants in the Employee Plans to the Buyer's employee benefit plans within
one year of Closing. In the event that any Employee Plan that is a qualified
pension benefit plan is terminated by Buyer after the Closing, the participants'
account balances that are accrued under such Employee Plans shall, to the extent
allowable by law, be merged into or otherwise transferred to a plan or plans
maintained by Buyer (or its Affiliates) in which such participants (assuming
such participants are active participants in the Employee Plans at such time)
may participate. Buyer agrees that the Transferred Employees shall retain their
service credit for all periods of employment with RP or any of the Members of
the RP Group (or their predecessor entities) under the Employee Plans prior to
the Closing Date, except to the extent it would result in duplicate benefits
with respect to the same period of service. To the extent covered under any
Buyer welfare benefit plan, Buyer agrees to cause all applicable welfare benefit
plans of Buyer to waive any preexisting condition, limitation, exclusion or
waiting period for the Transferred Employees and their dependents, to the extent
that such preexisting conditions, limitations, exclusions or waiting periods
were satisfied, covered, or waived under similar Employee Plans.


                                     -45-
<PAGE>

     7.5 RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. Nothing contained herein shall require that
Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue the employment of any Transferred
Employee following the Closing Date (other than as for the period and under the
circumstances as specifically set forth in Section 7.2 hereof), nor shall this
Agreement limit in any way Buyer's (or its Affiliates') ability or right to
amend or terminate any benefit or compensation plan or program of Buyer or its
Affiliates, including the Employee Plans, at any time.

     7.6 EMPLOYEE INFORMATION. Each Member of the RP Group and Buyer shall
furnish to each other such employee information and such description of
personnel policies, procedures and benefits plans applicable to Business
Employees as a party may reasonably request, both prior to and after the
Closing, including years of service to be counted for eligibility and vesting
purposes under any employee benefit plan, information pertinent to COBRA
determinations and the status of any deductibles or similar provisions within
benefit plans as needed for administrative purposes. Each Member of the RP Group
and Buyer shall each make its appropriate employees available to the other at
such reasonable times as may be necessary for the proper administration by the
other of any and all matters relating to employee benefits and worker's
compensation claims affecting their employees.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                     -47-

other Action by or before any Authority which is reasonably expected to

                                   ARTICLE XI
                                INDEMNIFICATION

     11.1 INDEMNIFICATION BY RP. (a) Subject to the limitations contained in
this Article XI, effective upon the Closing, RP shall (and, (solely with respect
to Section 11.1(a)(i) regarding breaches of representations and warranties
contained in Section 4.1(a), 4.2 or 4.26, Section 11.1(a)(ii) regarding breaches
of any agreement or covenant of RP or the RP Equityholders contained in this
Agreement to be performed after Closing ("POST-CLOSING COVENANTS") or Section
11.1(a)(iii) or (iv) (collectively, the "RP EQUITYHOLDER MATTERS")) to the
extent RP does not or is not able to, the RP Equityholders in the proportions
set forth on Schedule 11.1 (the "DESIGNATED PROPORTIONS")) indemnify and hold
Buyer (for purposes of this right to indemnification, "Buyer" shall include its
Affiliates and their respective directors, employees, agents, successors and
assigns) harmless from and against all Losses arising out of, incurred in
connection with or relating to:

               (i) any breach of a representation or warranty made by RP in this
     Agreement or any Schedule hereto or other agreement or document delivered
     in connection herewith;

               (ii) any breach of any agreement or covenant of RP contained in
    this Agreement;

               (iii) any Excluded Liability; or

               (iv) any claim or Action relating to the breach by RP, any other
     Member of the RP Group or any holder of equity interests in RP of the
     limited liability company agreement of RP or any other Member of the RP
     Group or any other organizational document governing RP or other Member of
     the RP Group or Contract (including Contracts among holders of the equity
     of RP) relating to the equity or governance of RP or any other Member of
     the RP Group.

For the sake of clarity, Buyer shall not be required to seek indemnification
hereunder with respect to RP Equityholder Matters from the Escrow and may seek
such indemnification from RP (or, to the extent RP does not or is not able to,
the RP Equityholders in the Designated Proportions). It is understood that if RP
shall no longer exist, Buyer's rights to indemnification hereunder shall not be
affected and Buyer shall, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, still be
entitled to indemnification hereunder from the Escrow and, with respect to the
RP Equityholder Matters, the RP Equityholders in the Designated Proportions.

     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the following sentence, in
the case of Losses incurred as a result of a breach set forth in Section
11.1(a)(i) or (ii), RP shall not be liable for indemnification hereunder unless
and until the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds $5 million (the "BUYER
BASKET"), in which event Buyer shall be entitled to indemnification for all
Losses in excess of the Buyer Basket; provided, that RP's aggregate liability
with respect to Section 11.1(a)(i) or (ii) shall in no event exceed the Escrow
Amount (the "BUYER CAP") (as an example, if Buyer's indemnifiable Losses
hereunder, other than Losses to which the Buyer Basket does not apply, equal $15
million, Buyer shall be entitled to $10


                                     -52-
<PAGE>

million in indemnification from RP). Neither the Buyer Basket nor the Buyer Cap
shall apply to Losses under Section 11.1(a) (iii) or (iv) above or Losses
incurred as a result of a breach of representations or warranties contained in
Section 4.1(a), 4.2 and 4.26 or a breach of a Post-Closing Covenant. It is
understood that to the extent a matter constitutes both a breach of a
representation or warranty and an Excluded Liability, the matter shall be
treated as an Excluded Liability and the Buyer Basket and Buyer Cap and any
survival period shall not apply thereto.

     (c) With respect to any Indemnity Claim arising from an alleged breach of
the representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.6 hereof which involves
liability for, or the conduct of, any environmental action relating to
Contamination, including, but not limited to investigatory, corrective or
remedial action (the "REMEDIAL ACTION"), in addition to any other applicable
provisions of this Article XI (and not in lieu thereof, except to the extent any
such provision is inconsistent with this Section 11.1(c)), the following
provisions set forth in this Section 11.1(c) shall apply. To the extent any
Indemnity Claims arising from an alleged breach of the representation and
warranty set forth in Section 4.6 hereof do not involve liability for, or the
conduct of, any Remedial Action, such provisions shall not apply and the
Indemnity Claim shall be solely governed by the otherwise-applicable provisions
of this Article XI:

               (i) the obligation to indemnify Buyer with respect to any
     Remedial Action shall arise only upon identification of the presence of
     Contamination at levels exceeding those requiring Remedial Action pursuant
     to Environmental Laws, for this purpose as enacted and in effect as of the
     Closing Date;

               (ii) With respect to any matter as to which (i) above has been
     satisfied, Buyer shall be entitled (but not obligated) to engage a
     reputable third party environmental consultant (the "CONSULTANT") and to
     cause the Consultant to formulate an environmental remediation plan, the
     implementation of which will, in a cost-effective manner, attain compliance
     with cleanup standards under then-applicable Environmental Laws based upon
     the use of the Real Property as of the Closing Date (the "PLAN"). Buyer's
     choice of a Consultant and the Plan (including any change orders or
     modifications thereto) shall be subject to RP's (or, if RP no longer
     exists, the RP Equityholders' Agent's) prior written approval, such
     approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and shall
     be deemed to have been granted by RP (or the RP Equityholders' Agent) if RP
     (or the RP Equityholders' Agent) shall not have notified Buyer in writing
     of its disapproval within ten business days after receiving Buyer's written
     request for RP's (or the RP Equityholders' Agent's) approval. The
     Consultant shall, on behalf of Buyer, oversee the Remedial Action in
     accordance with the approved Plan and all obligations for payment incurred
     in connection therewith (including, without limitation, all fees and other
     compensation payable to the Consultant) shall, subject to application of
     the Buyer Basket and Buyer Cap, constitute "Losses" for which Buyer shall
     be entitled to indemnification under this Section 11.1. Buyer may elect to
     have the Plan provide for remediation in excess of that required to attain
     compliance, in a cost-effective manner, with cleanup standards under
     then-applicable Environmental Laws based upon the use of the Real Property
     as of the Closing, in which event Buyer shall pay for the excess by which
     the cost of remediation exceeds that which is required to attain such
     standards. If Buyer shall elect to waive recovery under the foregoing
     indemnity with respect to a breach of any representation or warranty made
     by RP in Section 4.6 (it being understood and agreed


                                     -53-
<PAGE>

     that Buyer shall be under no obligation to agree to any such waiver), Buyer
     shall not be required to obtain RP's (or the RP Equityholders' Agent's)
     approval with respect to the Consultant, the Plan or any other matter
     relating to Remedial Action, and RP shall be relieved of any liabilities or
     obligations with respect thereto. Except in the aforementioned case where
     Buyer elects to waive recovery under the indemnification, the parties agree
     to reasonably cooperate with one another in connection with any matter
     covered hereunder, which cooperation shall include providing one another
     with copies of relevant documentation and affording one another the
     opportunity, in a timely manner, to comment upon draft reports and
     submittals and participate, when reasonably feasible, in material meetings
     and other interactions with governmental authorities and third parties (so
     long as such participation does not unreasonably interfere with, delay or
     hinder the process or progress of any such meeting or interaction); and

               (iii) Buyer's entitlement to indemnification with respect to any
     Remedial Action shall extend only to completion of such Remedial Action as
     is necessary, in a cost-effective manner, to attain compliance with cleanup
     standards under then-applicable Environmental Laws based upon the use of
     the Real Property as of the Closing Date, for this purpose as such
     Environmental Laws are enacted and in effect as of the completion of such
     Remedial Action, and shall be deemed satisfied upon the attainment of such
     standards and receipt of written approval of such Remedial Action from the
     applicable governmental authority.

     (d) In order to prevent duplication of recovery under this Agreement with
respect to any particular Loss: (1) Buyer will not be entitled to
indemnification under this Article XI for any Losses to the extent such Losses
have reduced the amount of Adjusted Assets or increased the amount of Adjusted
Liabilities, in each case which are set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet and
included in the calculation of Closing Net Assets, and (2) no party will be
entitled to indemnification for any particular Losses (or application of
particular Losses against the Basket) under any provision of this Agreement to
the extent such party has already been indemnified for such Losses (or such
Losses have already been applied against the Basket) under another provision of
this Agreement.

     11.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER. (a) Subject to the limitations contained in
this Article XI, effective upon the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold RP
(for purposes of this right to indemnification, "RP" shall include its
Affiliates and their respective directors, employees, agents, successors and
assigns) harmless from and against all Losses arising out of, incurred in
connection with or relating to:

               (i) any breach of a representation or warranty made by Buyer in
     this Agreement or any Schedule hereto or other agreement or document
      delivered in connection herewith;

               (ii) any breach of any agreement or covenant of Buyer contained
     in this Agreement;

               (iii) any Assumed Liability; or


                                     -54-
<PAGE>
               (iv) Buyer's operation of the Business after Closing, but not to
     the extent resulting from RP's actions or operations prior to Closing.

     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the following sentence, in
the case of Losses incurred as a result of a breach set forth in Section
11.2(a)(i), Buyer shall not be liable for indemnification hereunder unless and
until the aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds $5 million (the "RP BASKET"),
in which event RP shall be entitled to indemnification for all Losses in excess
of the RP Basket; provided, however, that Buyer's aggregate liability with
respect to Section 11.2(a)(i) shall in no event exceed $10 million (the "RP
CAP"). Neither the RP Basket nor the RP Cap shall apply to Losses under Section
11.2(a)(iii) or (iv) above or Losses incurred as a result of a breach of
representations or warranties contained in Section 5.1 or 5.2 or a breach of any
agreement or covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement to be performed after
Closing.

     11.3 SURVIVAL. The covenants and agreements made by RP and the RP
Equityholders and Buyer shall survive the Closing. All of the representations
and warranties and covenants and agreements (other than Post-Closing Covenants
which shall survive for the applicable statute of limitations) made by RP and
the RP Equityholders and Buyer in this Agreement and the indemnification
obligations under this Article XI shall survive the Closing for a period of
eighteen months from the Closing Date.

     11.4 DEFINITION OF LOSS; DETERMINATION OF INDEMNIFICATION. For purposes of
this Article XI, "LOSSES" shall mean, collectively, any and all claims, damages,
or losses whatsoever, together with out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel, accountants, consultants or
experts and expenses of investigation incurred by a party entitled to
indemnification hereunder as a result of a matter giving rise to a claim for
indemnification hereunder, incurred in connection with or arising out of or
relating to any Action instituted against the indemnified party, such amounts to
be (a) determined net of (1) the insurance proceeds which the indemnified party
actually receives in respect of such matter and (2) indemnity payments which the
indemnified party actually receives from parties other than the indemnifying
party hereunder in respect of such matter, (b) increased by any Tax (or
increased by any reduction in any Tax benefit) actually borne by the indemnified
party that would not have been borne but for such Losses or the payment of any
indemnity in respect thereof and (c) decreased by any Tax benefit (or decreased
by any reduction in any Tax) actually realized by the indemnified party that
would not have been realized but for such Losses or the payment of any indemnity
in respect thereof, but in no event including punitive damages or consequential
damages including consequential damages consisting of lost profits except for
any such punitive damages or consequential damages (including consequential
damages consisting of lost profits) owed or paid to a third party. For purposes
of this paragraph, the indemnified party will be deemed to recognize a Tax
benefit with respect to a taxable year if, and to the extent that, the
indemnified party's cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such
taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items attributable to the Losses
and the receipt of indemnity payments therefor from all taxable years, exceeds
the indemnified party's actual cumulative tax liability for Taxes through the
end of such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax items
attributable to the Losses and the receipt of indemnity payments therefor for
all taxable years (to the extent permitted by relevant Tax law and treating such
Tax items as the last items taken into account for any taxable year). When, as,
and if the indemnified party recognizes


                                     -55-
<PAGE>

any Tax benefit attributable to Losses after the making of indemnification
payments therefor, and to the extent such Tax benefit has not reduced the amount
of such indemnification payments, the indemnified party will promptly after
recognition thereof pay in cash the amount of such recognized Tax benefit to an
account specified by the indemnifying party. For purposes of determining if
Buyer or RP, as the case may be, is entitled to indemnification hereunder, all
representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained herein shall be
considered without reference to materiality or material adverse effect
qualifiers.

     11.5 NOTICE. (a) RP will (or, solely with respect to RP Equityholder
Matters, to the extent RP does not or is not able to, the RP Equityholders will
in the Designated Proportions), on demand, compensate Buyer in respect of any
Losses which are mutually agreed or finally determined to be covered by the
indemnities set forth in Section 11.1 hereof, in the manner provided in this
Article XI and the Escrow Agreement. It is understood that if RP shall no longer
exist, Buyer's rights to indemnification hereunder shall not be affected and
Buyer shall, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, still be entitled to
indemnification hereunder from the Escrow and, with respect to the RP
Equityholder Matters, the RP Equityholders in the Designated Proportions. Buyer
will, on demand, compensate RP in respect of any Losses which are mutually
agreed or finally determined to be covered by the indemnities set forth in
Section 11.2 hereof, in the manner provided in this Article XI.

     (b) If any matter shall arise which may involve or give rise to a claim by
Buyer against RP under the provisions of Section 11.1 or by RP against Buyer
under the provisions of Section 11.2 (an "INDEMNITY CLAIM"), Buyer or RP, as the
case may be, shall give prompt written notice (a "NOTICE OF CLAIM") of such
Indemnity Claim, a description in reasonable detail of the factual basis thereof
(to the extent such information is available), and the amount of indemnity
sought (if then known or reasonably determinable) to the Escrow Agent, RP and
the RP Equityholders' Agent (if a claim by Buyer) or to Buyer (if a claim by
RP); provided, that the failure to give timely notice will not relieve RP (or,
to the extent applicable, the RP Equityholders) (if a claim by Buyer) or Buyer
(if a claim by RP) from the obligation to indemnify against such claim except to
the extent that RP (or, to the extent applicable, the RP Equityholders) (if a
claim by Buyer) or Buyer (if a claim by RP) establishes by competent evidence
that it is materially prejudiced thereby.

     (c) If the RP Equityholders' Agent does not, within 30 days after receipt
of the Notice of Claim, notify Buyer and the Escrow Agent in writing, that the
RP Equityholders' Agent disputes the applicable Indemnity Claim, in whole or in
part, then Buyer, may instruct the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement to pay Buyer from the Escrow the amount of the Indemnity Claim at
once, and to the extent the Escrow is not then in effect or the remaining Escrow
Amount does not cover the amount so due to Buyer, RP shall pay the remaining
amount to Buyer within 5 business days of the end of the 30 day period following
receipt by RP of the Notice of Claim (and, solely with respect to RP
Equityholder Matters, if RP fails to do so, the RP Equityholders shall pay to
Buyer the remaining amount in the Designated Proportions within 3 days following
the end of such 5 business day period). If the RP Equityholders' Agent within 30
days after receipt of the Notice of Claim, notifies Buyer and the Escrow Agent
in writing that the RP Equityholders' Agent disputes the applicable Indemnity
Claim, in whole or in part, then the provisions of Sections 11.5(e) and (f)
shall apply. If a Notice of Claim is made by Buyer under Section 11.5(b) hereof
and if it is finally agreed or determined


                                     -56-
<PAGE>

(pursuant to Section 11.5(f) or by a final, nonappealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction) that RP (and, if applicable, the RP Equityholders) are
obligated to indemnify Buyer, subject to Section 11.1(a), such indemnification
shall be paid upon notice to the Escrow Agent by Buyer in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, directing the Escrow Agent to pay the amount of
the Losses to Buyer in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Escrow
Agreement and to the extent the Escrow is not then in effect or the remaining
Escrow Amount does not cover the amount so due to Buyer, RP shall, subject to
the terms and conditions hereof, pay the remaining amount to Buyer within 5
business days of the date of final agreement or determination (and, solely with
respect to RP Equityholder Matters, if RP fails to do so, the RP Equityholders
shall pay to Buyer the remaining amount in the Designated Proportions within 3
days following the end of such 5 business day period).

     (d) If Buyer does not, within 30 days after receipt of a Notice of Claim,
notify RP in writing that Buyer disputes the applicable Indemnity Claim, in
whole or in part, then Buyer shall promptly pay to RP by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by RP the amount of the
Indemnity Claim. If Buyer within 30 days after receipt of a Notice of Claim
notifies RP in writing that Buyer disputes the applicable Indemnity Claim, in
whole or in part, then the provisions of Section 11.5(f) shall apply. If a
Notice of Claim is made by RP under Section 11.5(b) hereof and if it is finally
agreed or determined (pursuant to Section 11.5(f) or by a court of competent
jurisdiction) that Buyer is obligated to indemnify RP, such indemnification
shall be paid promptly by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by RP.

     (e) In the event that, prior to the release of the Escrow Amount, Buyer
shall have delivered a Notice of Claim pursuant to Section 11.5(b) hereof and
shall not have received the amount claimed thereunder from the Escrow Agent, RP
or the RP Equityholders, then the Escrow Agreement shall provide that the total
of the amounts set forth in such Notice of Claim (whether actually incurred,
pending or threatened) shall be set aside and retained by the Escrow Agent as a
reserve to cover such Indemnity Claim(s), in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

     (f) In the event that the indemnifying party disputes the existence and/or
amount of a claim for indemnification set forth in a Notice of Claim, it will be
entitled to deliver a notice to the indemnified party disputing its validity or
the amount thereof (the "CLAIM DISPUTE NOTICE"). The Claim Dispute Notice will
be given within 30 days of receipt of the Notice of Claim to which the Claim
Dispute Notice relates. Upon receiving such Claim Dispute Notice, the
indemnified party shall provide the indemnifying party with access to such books
and records as may be reasonably requested by the indemnifying party for
purposes of verifying such claim. The indemnified party and the indemnifying
party shall in good faith meet promptly after such review so as to come to a
settlement of the matter. In the event a settlement is not achieved within 30
days after the date of the Claim Dispute Notice, the indemnified party may
pursue whatever legal remedies may be available.

     11.6 THIRD PARTY CLAIM. (a) If Buyer's Indemnity Claim involves any Action
brought or made by any third party (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), then the RP
Equityholders' Agent may elect (by written notice to Buyer) to assume at its
expense the defense of such Third Party Claim using counsel reasonably
acceptable to Buyer; provided that the RP Equityholders' Agent may not so elect
if Buyer has been pursuing the defense thereof for at least six months and the
RP


                                     -57-
<PAGE>

Equityholders' Agent's assumption of such defense would materially prejudice
Buyer or the defense. If the RP Equityholders' Agent does not so elect to assume
such defense, then such Third Party Claim shall be defended by Buyer in such
manner as it reasonably deems appropriate (and the costs, fees and expenses of
Buyer for such defense shall constitute Losses), including entering a reasonable
settlement thereof in which event the settlement plus the Buyer's costs, fees
and expenses with respect thereto shall be the Loss; provided that Buyer shall
not enter into any settlement of such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the RP Equityholders' Agent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld unless RP and the RP Equityholders have no liability
therefor in which case no consent shall be required. RP and the RP
Equityholders' Agent shall cooperate with Buyer in connection with such defense
and shall permit Buyer to participate therein; provided, that RP (and the RP
Equityholders) shall not be liable to Buyer under the provisions hereof for any
legal or other expenses incurred by Buyer in connection with Buyer's
participation in the defense of such Third Party Claim after the RP
Equityholders' Agent has elected to assume the defense thereof so long as the RP
Equityholders' Agent is diligently contesting such Third Party Claim in good
faith, unless a conflict of interest exists between Buyer and RP (or the RP
Equityholders) requiring each of Buyer, on the one hand, and RP or the RP
Equityholders, on the other hand, to have separate counsel, in which case Buyer
may engage separate counsel (the fees and costs of which shall be borne by RP
(or, solely with respect to RP Equityholder Matters, in the event RP does not or
cannot pay such fees and costs, by the RP Equityholders in the Designated
Proportions)). Neither RP nor the RP Equityholders' Agent may enter into any
settlement of a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of Buyer
which will not be unreasonably withheld.

     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Third Party Claim includes or would
reasonably be expected to include both a claim for Taxes that are Excluded Taxes
and a claim for Taxes that are not Excluded Taxes, and such claim for Taxes that
are Excluded Taxes is not separable from such a claim for Taxes that are not
Excluded Taxes, the RP Equityholders' Agent (if the claim for Taxes that are
Excluded Taxes exceeds or reasonably would be expected to exceed in amount the
claim for Taxes that are not Excluded Taxes) or otherwise Buyer (the RP
Equityholders' Agent or Buyer, as the case may be, the "CONTROLLING PARTY")
shall be entitled to control the defense of such Third Party Claim (such Third
Party Claim, a "TAX CLAIM"). In such case, the other party (the RP
Equityholders' Agent or Buyer, as the case may be, the "NON-CONTROLLING PARTY)"
shall be entitled to participate fully (at the Non-Controlling Party's sole
expense) in the conduct of such Tax Claim and the Controlling Party shall not
settle such Tax Claim without the consent of such Non-Controlling Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The costs and expenses of
conducting the defense of such Tax Claim shall be reasonably apportioned based
on the relative amounts of the Tax Claim that are Excluded Taxes and that are
not Excluded Taxes.

     11.7 CONTINUING LIABILITY FOR INDEMNITY CLAIMS. The indemnity obligations
of the indemnifying parties shall survive the applicable time period provided in
Section 11.3 with respect to any claim made prior to the end of such period
until the liability is finally determined, and an amount sufficient to cover any
such undetermined obligation of RP (and, to the extent applicable, the RP
Equityholders) (or the remaining Escrow, whichever is smaller) shall remain in
the Escrow until such obligation is determined.


                                     -58-
<PAGE>

     11.8 INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS AGAINST RP. The
provisions of Sections 11.6(a) and 11.6(b) shall apply with respect to claims
under Section 11.2 with appropriate adjustments as Buyer is the purported
indemnifying party and RP is the purported indemnified party.

     11.9 EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Except in the case of actual fraud, from and after
the Closing, the provisions of this Article XI shall be the exclusive remedy of
Buyer, RP and the RP Equityholders in respect of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including indemnification for matters which
are the subject of the representations contained in Section 4.6 and for the
breach of any representations or warranties or covenants hereunder; provided
that Buyer and RP shall be entitled to the equitable remedy of specific
performance to enforce any covenant or agreement of the parties hereto (it being
understood that this provision shall not limit Buyer's rights with respect to
Excluded Liabilities or RP's rights with respect to Assumed Liabilities). To the
extent of any Escrow Amount remaining in Escrow, all claims by Buyer for
indemnification under this Article XI (other than with respect to RP
Equityholder Matters) will be resolved solely by recourse to the Escrow pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement prior to any recourse against RP.

     11.10 APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN NOTICES OF BREACHES. The indemnification
provisions of this Article XI shall not, after the Closing Date and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby entitle Buyer or RP or the
RP Equityholders to indemnification for any breaches or inaccuracies of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement which arise following
the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date and written notice of which Buyer
or RP, as the case may be, received from the other pursuant to Section 6.7.

                                  ARTICLE XII
                       TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

     12.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time before the
Closing:

                (i) by mutual written consent of RP and Buyer;

               (ii) by either RP or Buyer if there has been a material breach on
the part of the other of a representation, warranty or agreement contained
herein, or in any agreement or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement,
which remains uncured for more than 30 days following notice thereof; provided
that the party terminating pursuant to this Section 12.1(ii) is not then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained
herein; or

              (iii) by either RP or Buyer if the Closing has not occurred by
July 1, 2002.

     12.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 12.1, this Agreement shall become wholly void and of no further force
and effect and there shall be no further Liability on the part of any party
hereto, except to comply with Sections 6.4, 6.5 and Article XIII. No such
termination shall relieve any party of any Liability to the other for any breach
of this Agreement prior to the date of termination.

instrument executed by RP (or, if RP no longer exists, the RP Equityholders'
Agent) and Buyer.

     12.4 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time before the Closing, RP may, with
respect to Buyer, or Buyer may, with respect to RP and/or the RP Equityholders

party or parties hereto, (b) waive any misrepresentation (including an omission)
or breach of a representation or warranty of the other party or parties hereto,
whether contained herein or in any exhibit, schedule or document delivered
pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance of the other party or parties hereto
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid if set forth in a written instrument signed by the party
giving the extension or waiver.
