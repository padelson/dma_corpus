ARTICLE III 

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES



Section 3.1 _Effect on Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of the capital stock of the Company, each share of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into 2.3 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_
") of Parent Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), subject to Section
3.2. The Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, reclassification, recapitalization, consolidation, exchange or like
change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock or any



 

13 extraordinary dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock, in
each case, occurring (or having a record date) after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.



Section 3.2 _No Fractional Shares; Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Company
Common Stock_.



(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no certificates for
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each
holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash
(without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional
share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking
into account all shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder at the
Effective Time) by the Parent Closing Share Price. No such holder shall be
entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any
fractional share.



(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, all shares of
Company Common Stock that are (i) held by the Company as treasury shares or
(ii) owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, in each case immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no securities of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.



Section 3.3 _Dissenting Shares_.



(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that the applicable requirements of Section 1300(b) of the CGCL have been
satisfied, shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding on the date
for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote on the Merger and
which were voted against the Merger or did not consent thereto in writing (if
such action is taken by written consent) and the holders of which have
demanded that the Company purchase such shares at their fair market value in
accordance with Section 1301 of CGCL and have submitted such shares for
endorsement in accordance with Section 1302 of CGCL and have not otherwise
failed to perfect or shall not have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights
to purchase for case under CGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the Merger Consideration, but, instead, the holders thereof
shall be entitled to have their shares purchased by the Company for cash at
the fair market value of such Company Dissenting Shares as agreed upon or
determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 1300 et seq. of CGCL;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to payment
under CGCL, such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time of the Merger, into the
Merger Consideration set forth in Section 3.1 hereof, without any interest
thereon.



(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands pursuant
to Section 1300 et seq. of CGCL received by the Company,



 

14 withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to CGCL
and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands under Section 1300 et
seq. of CGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any such demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.



Section 3.4 _Options_.



(a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company Stock Plans as well
as the rights, duties and obligations of the Company with respect to the
administration of such plans.



(b) At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Option_ ") which is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto, whether vested or
unvested, shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of
Company Common Stock and shall be assumed and shall be converted into an
option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the
original Company Option, that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share of Company Common
Stock, at a price per share (rounded up the nearest one-hundredth of a cent)
equal to the per share exercise price specified in such Company Option divided
by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any
Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its
qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the option price, the number of
shares subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such
option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements
of Section 424(a) of the Code. The parties will make good faith efforts to
make equitable adjustments to ensure that the conversions of Company Options
contemplated by this Section 3.4(b) comply with Section 409A of the Code.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for issuance the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to satisfy Parents obligations under
this Section 3.4.



(c) On the same day as the Effective Time (if it has not done so prior
thereto), Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement
on Form S-8 to register the sale of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to the Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant to Section 3.4(a),
and Parent shall cause such registration statement to become and remain
effective until the earlier of (i) the date on which all such assumed Company
Options are no longer outstanding and (ii) the date on which all such shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to all such assumed Company Options
are tradable without restriction as to volume pursuant to Rule 144 of the
Securities Act. In addition, Parent shall take further actions as may be
reasonably necessary to include under such registration statement all
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to all such assumed Company
Options of those persons who are directors of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time.



 

15 Section 3.5 _Exchange Agent_. Parent shall appoint an agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the purpose of exchanging certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Company Certificates_ ") for the Merger Consideration. At or
promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article III, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and an estimated amount of
cash sufficient to pay any cash that may be payable in lieu of any fractional
shares (such cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together
with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").



Section 3.6 _Exchange Procedures_. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of
a Company Certificate a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Company Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock, if any, into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Company Certificate or Company Certificates shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Company Certificate for
exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Company
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate
representing that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (if any) to which
such former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, a check representing the
amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock which such former holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Company Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article
III, and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder shall have
become entitled pursuant to Section 3.6(b), and the Company Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares.



(b) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Company Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender
such Company Certificate in accordance with this Article III. After the
surrender of a Company Certificate in accordance with this Article III,
the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or
other distributions, without any interest thereon, with a record date after
the Effective Time and which theretofore had become payable with respect to
whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Company Certificate.



 

16 (c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in the name of a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Company Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and
otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any applicable stock
transfer or other Taxes or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.



(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Company Certificates representing such shares are presented
for transfer to Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in
this Article III.



(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for twelve months after the Effective Time shall
be paid, at the request of Parent, to Parent. Any shareholders of the Company
who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look
only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration and unpaid dividends
and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock held by such shareholder at the Effective Time
as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of
Parent, the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to
any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.



(f) In the event any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.



(g) Parent or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent are
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any applicable provision of any other U.S. federal,
state, local or non-U.S. tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are
properly withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.



 

17 Section 3.7 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation
with full right, title and possession to all assets, properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers
and directors of the Company and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name
of their respective corporations, or otherwise, to take, and they will take,
all such lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is consistent
with this Agreement.



Section 3.8  _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. No shares of Merger Sub stock
will be issued directly or indirectly in the Merger. Each share of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, no par value per share of the Surviving Corporation.

ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time period specified in the rules and

connection with the existence, operation or administration of a Benefit Plan,
other than routine claims for benefits.



(k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction

or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any material payment or
benefit to any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) cause or result in the funding of any Benefit Plan or (iii)
cause or result in a limitation on the right of the Company or any of its

49 the Company shall take into account any changes to the financial terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal or
otherwise.

of the

to, the Proxy Statement will made by the Company, in each case without
providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the Company
or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers,
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that
either such document would not include any misstatement of material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable

personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably
request. Any such access shall be conducted under the supervision of personnel
of the Company and in a manner that does not interfere with the normal
operations of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, nothing in this Section 6.7 shall require the Company to disclose any
information that, in its sole and absolute discretion, (i) it is not legally
permitted to disclose or the disclosure of which would contravene any
applicable law or binding order (including any Antitrust Law) or (ii) the
disclosure of which would be reasonably likely to cause the loss of any
attorney-client or other legal privilege.

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist

matters), (ii) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order

such party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as
soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request.



Section 6.9 _State Takeover Statutes_. Parent, the Company and their
respective Board of Directors shall (i) take all reasonable action necessary
to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is
or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on the terms set forth herein and (ii) if any state takeover
statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement or the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement on the terms set forth herein, take

52 Section 6.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.



(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of its current or
former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "). In addition, for a period of six (6) years following
the Effective Time, Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to) cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws (and
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification and
exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification and
exculpation provisions contained in the articles of incorporation and bylaws
(or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six (6)
year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any respect, except as required by Law.



(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person
covered by the DandO Insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
complete and accurate copy of which has been heretofore delivered to Parent),
on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts no less favorable than those
of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, at its option, (i) substitute
therefor policies of the Surviving Corporation containing terms with respect
to coverage and amount no less favorable to such persons or (ii) request that
the Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing
insurance program (to be effective as of the Effective Time), provided
further, however, that in satisfying its obligations under this Section
6.10(b) the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 250% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for
its last full fiscal year (such 250% amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_
") (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be $958,000 in the
aggregate), provided that that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost
not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may
request Parent to purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the DandO
Insurance and if Parent rejects such request, the Company may purchase such
"tail" policy on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less
advantageous than the DandO Insurance, provided that the amount paid by the
Company for such "tail" policy shall not exceed six times the Maximum Annual
Premium and provided further that the Company and Parent shall coordinate with
each other in good faith to optimize the



 

53 terms and prices of such "tail" policy. In the event that the Company
purchases such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu
of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the
first sentence of this Section 6.10(b) for so long as such "tail" policy shall
be maintained in full force and effect.



(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall
(i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10. 



(d) The obligations under this Section 6.10 shall not be terminated, amended
or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the
"tail" policy referred to in paragraph (b) above (and their heirs and
representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance
or the "tail" policy referred to in paragraph (b) above (and their heirs and
representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are
beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
paragraph (b) above (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be
third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in paragraph (b) above (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this Section 6.10 shall be in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent
organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at
law or in equity).



(e) The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries under this Section 6.10 shall be joint and several.



Section 6.11 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent
orally and in writing of any litigation commenced after the date hereof
against the Company or any of its directors by any shareholder of the Company
relating to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such
litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the
Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such shareholder litigation
and shall consider Parents views with respect to such shareholder litigation
and shall not settle any such shareholder litigation without the prior
written consent of Parent which shall not be unreasonably withheld.



 

54 Section 6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_.



(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (i) the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any event of which it has Knowledge, the occurrence or non-

the conditions to closing set forth in Section 7.2(a) would fail to be
satisfied, and (ii) to the extent it has Knowledge thereof, any failure by the
Company to materially comply with or materially satisfy any covenant or other
agreement to be complied with by it hereunder such that the conditions to

Parent or Merger Sub to materially comply with or materially satisfy any

of or material default under any material Contract, or (ii) any notice or
other communication received by it from any third party, subsequent to the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, alleging that the
consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with the

delivery of notice pursuant to this Section 6.12(c) shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent.



Section 6.13 _Affiliate Letters_. At least 30 days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of names and addresses of those

145 of the rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Act. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be
delivered to Parent, prior to the Closing Date, from each of the

") as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate (after reasonable consultation
with the Company), including terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to the
Effective Time, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan and applicable Law and
provided that such action does not preclude the immediate participation of the
