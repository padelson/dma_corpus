NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set
forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

SECTION 1.01. _The Offer_. (a) (i) Provided that this Agreement shall
not have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.01 and that none of the
events set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3) of Exhibit A hereto shall have
occurred and be continuing, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten Business Days
following the date of this Agreement commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange
Act_ "))) the Offer to purchase all outstanding Shares, at the Offer Price.
The obligations of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept
for payment and to pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject to only those conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the " _Offer
Conditions_ "). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the
twentieth Business Day (as defined in Section 9.10(c)) following (and
including the day of) the commencement of the Offer. Purchaser expressly
reserves the right (but is not obligated) at any time or from time to time in
its sole discretion to waive any Offer Condition or modify or amend the terms
of the Offer, except that, without the prior written consent of the Company,
Purchaser shall not (A) decrease the Offer Price or change the form of the
consideration payable in the Offer, (B) decrease the number of Shares sought
pursuant to the Offer, (C) waive the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in
Exhibit A), (D) add to the conditions set forth on Exhibit A, (E) modify the
conditions set forth on Exhibit A in a manner adverse to the holders of
Shares, (F) extend the expiration of the Offer except as required or
permitted by Section 1.01(a)(ii) or (G) make any other change in the terms or
conditions of the Offer which is adverse to the holders of Shares.

(ii) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions as of any
scheduled expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, accept for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after such scheduled
expiration and Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
accept and promptly pay for all Shares as they are validly tendered during
any subsequent offer period. Purchaser may, without the consent of the
Company, (A) extend the Offer for one or more periods of time of up to twenty
Business Days per extension if at any scheduled expiration of the Offer any
of the Offer Conditions are not satisfied, until such time as such Offer
Conditions are satisfied or waived, (B) extend the Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof or the
NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC (" _NASDAQ_ ") applicable to the Offer or (C) elect
to provide a subsequent offering period for the Offer in accordance with Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall not extend
the Offer pursuant to clause (A) of this subsection beyond the Outside Date
without the consent of the Company. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, (1) if, as of any  



 

2  Expiration Date (as defined in Exhibit A), the Offer Conditions set forth in
Paragraph 1(b) of Exhibit A are not satisfied or waived by Purchaser, then
upon written request by the Company delivered on or prior to such Expiration
Date, Purchaser shall extend the Offer for a period of not more than ten
Business Days in order to permit the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions; (2)
if, as of any Expiration Date, all of the Offer Conditions (other than the
Minimum Tender Condition) have been satisfied or waived by Purchaser, but the
Minimum Tender Condition is not satisfied, Purchaser shall, upon the written
request of the Company, extend the Offer for a period of ten Business Days,
in order to permit the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions; _provided_ , that
if at the end of such ten Business Day period, all of the Offer Conditions
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition) are satisfied, but the Minimum
Tender Condition is not satisfied, Purchaser shall not be required to make any
further extension pursuant to this clause (2); (3) if, as of any Expiration
Date, the Offer Condition set forth in paragraph 2(b) of Exhibit A has not
been satisfied or waived by Purchaser and the breach or failure to perform or
comply that has caused such non-satisfaction is unintentional and capable of
being cured within ten Business Days of receipt by the Company of notice
of such breach, then Purchaser shall extend the Offer until the expiration of
such cure period; and (4) if, within four Business Days prior to any
Expiration Date the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal (or a revision to
a previously received Acquisition Proposal) that is still pending as of such
Expiration Date, then upon written request of the Company, Purchaser shall
extend the Offer if necessary so that the Expiration Date does not occur until
the later of (x) the date that is five Business Days following the date of
the Companys initial receipt of such Acquisition Proposal (or such revision
to a previously received Acquisition Proposal) and (y) the last Business Day
of any required notice period pursuant to Section 6.02(d), or such earlier
date as specified by the Company in its request. Subject to the proviso in
clause (2) above, the foregoing rights of the Company to cause an extension of
the Offer are cumulative so that if at any time, any of the foregoing is
applicable, the Offer shall be so extended further. For the avoidance of
doubt, the parties hereto agree that shares of restricted stock may be
tendered in the Offer and be acquired by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to the
Offer. The Offer Price may be increased and the Offer may be extended to the
extent required by law in connection with such increase in each case without
the consent of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing Purchaser shall not
be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Purchaser shall file
or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ")
with respect to the Offer which shall contain the offer to purchase and
related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other ancillary
Offer documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer
Documents_ "). The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents prior to their filing
with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree (i) to provide the Company with, and
to consult with the Company regarding, any comments that may be received from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt thereof and prior to responding thereto and (ii) to provide the
Company with any comments or responses thereto. If at any time prior to the
Closing, any information relating to the Offer, the Merger, Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates,  



 

3  directors or officers is discovered by the Company or Parent, which
information should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer
Documents so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to
the extent required by applicable law or any applicable rule or regulation of
NASDAQ.

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Purchaser becomes
obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and Purchaser shall maintain such
funds exclusively for such purpose.

SECTION 1.02. _Company Actions_. (a) The Company hereby approves of and
consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that (i) the making of the
Offer by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Stockholder Support Agreement have been
consented to by the Company Board in accordance with the terms and provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated November 26, 2007, between Parent and
the Company (as amended on November 28, 2007, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), (ii) the Company Board (at a meeting or meetings duly called
and held) has unanimously (A) determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the stockholders of the
Company, (B) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (C) approved and declared advisable the agreement of merger (as
such term is used in Section 251 of the Corporation Law) contained in this
Agreement and directed that such agreement of merger be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company for adoption (unless the Merger is consummated in
accordance with Section 253 of the Corporation Law as contemplated by Section
2.09) and resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer and adoption of the
agreement of merger (as such term is used in Section 251 of the Corporation
Law) contained in this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company (such
recommendation, the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), (D) irrevocably
taken all necessary steps to render Section 203 of the Corporation Law
inapplicable to Parent and Purchaser and to the Merger, this Agreement, the
Stockholder Support Agreement and the acquisition of Shares pursuant to the
Offer and (E) irrevocably resolved to elect, to the extent permitted by law,
not to be subject to any other "moratorium", "control share acquisition",
"business combination", "fair price" or other form of anti-takeover laws and
regulations (collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ ") of any jurisdiction that may
purport to be applicable to this Agreement and (iii) Jefferies and Company,
Inc. (the " _Company Financial Advisor_ "), the Companys financial advisor,
has delivered its opinion to the Company Board to the effect that, as of the
date thereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein,
the consideration to be paid in the Offer and the Merger to the Companys
stockholders is fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders. As
soon as practicable after the date hereof, an executed copy of the written
opinion of the Company Financial Advisor will be delivered to Parent.

(b) On the date the Offer Documents are filed, the Company shall file with the
SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
all  



 

4  amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") containing,
subject to Section 6.02(d), the recommendations of the Company Board
described in Section 1.02(a) and, subject to Section 6.02(d), the Company
hereby consents to the inclusion of such recommendations in the Offer
Documents and to the inclusion of a copy of the Schedule 14D-9 with the Offer
Documents mailed or furnished to the Companys stockholders. Parent,
Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to its filing with the SEC. The
Company agrees (i) to provide Parent and Purchaser with, and to consult with
Parent and Purchaser regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly upon receipt thereof
and prior to responding thereto and (ii) to provide Parent and Purchaser with
any comments or responses thereto. If at any time prior to the Closing, any
information relating to the Offer, the Merger, Parent, Purchaser, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers is discovered by
the Company or Parent, which information should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Schedule 14D-9 so that the Schedule 14D-9 shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by applicable law or any
applicable rule or regulation of NASDAQ.

SECTION 1.03. _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the Company
shall cause its transfer agent to promptly (but in any event within five
Business Days after the date hereof) furnish Parent and Purchaser with mailing
labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of
the latest practicable date and shall furnish Parent and Purchaser with such
information and assistance (including periodic updates of such information) as
Parent or Purchaser or their agents may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of the Shares.
Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except for such actions as
are reasonably necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and otherwise to
perform its obligations hereunder, Purchaser shall hold all information and
documents provided to it under this Section 1.03 in confidence in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement, and shall use such information and
documents only in connection with the Offer, and if this Agreement shall have
been terminated Parent and Purchaser shall deliver to the Company all such
information and documents (and all copies thereof).

SECTION 1.04. _Directors_. (a) Promptly upon the purchase by Purchaser
pursuant to the Offer of such number of Shares as represents at least a
majority of the outstanding Shares, and from time to time thereafter,
Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up
to the next whole number, on the Company Board as will give Purchaser
representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the total number
of directors on the Company Board (after giving effect to any increase in the
number of directors pursuant to this Section 1.04) and the percentage that
such number of Shares so purchased bears to the total number of Shares
outstanding, and the Company shall, upon request by Purchaser, promptly
increase the size of the Company Board or use its reasonable best efforts to
secure the resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to provide
Purchaser with such level of representation and shall cause Purchasers
designees to be so  



 

5  elected or appointed. The Company will also use its reasonable best efforts
to cause individuals designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage
as is on the entire Company Board to constitute (i) each committee of the
Company Board, and (ii) each board of directors and each committee thereof of
each Subsidiary of the Company. The Companys obligations to appoint designees
to the Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act.
At the request of Purchaser, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
effect any such election or appointment of Purchasers designees, including
mailing to its stockholders the information required by Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder which, unless Purchaser
otherwise elects, shall be so mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent
and Purchaser will supply to the Company all information with respect to
themselves and their respective officers, directors and Affiliates required by
such Section and Rule.

(b) Following the election or appointment of Purchasers designees pursuant to
Section 1.04(a) and prior to the Effective Time, and so long as there shall be
at least one Continuing Director, any amendment or termination of this
Agreement requiring action by the Company Board, any extension of time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser
under this Agreement and any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions under this Agreement for the benefit of the Company or any
exercise of the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement will require
the concurrence of a majority of the directors of the Company then in office
who are directors of the Company on the date hereof (the " _Continuing
Directors_ ").

(c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to Section 1.04(a), until the Effective Time, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Board to have at
least such number of directors as may be required by the NASDAQ rules or the
federal securities laws to serve on the Companys audit committee who are
considered independent directors within the meaning of such rules and laws ("
_Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent shall have
no obligation to nominate or elect any Independent Directors.

SECTION 1.05. _Top-Up Option_. (a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to
Purchaser an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only after the
acceptance by Purchaser of, and payment for, Shares tendered in the Offer, to
purchase that number (but not less than that number) of Shares (the " _Top-Up
Shares_ ") as is equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to the
number of Shares owned directly or indirectly by Parent or Purchaser at the
time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the total
Shares then outstanding (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares) at a
price per Share equal to the Offer Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i)
the Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, at such time as Parent and
Purchaser, directly or indirectly, own at least 80% of the total number of
Shares then outstanding and on or prior to the 10th Business Day after the
Expiration Date or the expiration date of any subsequent offering period;
(ii) in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Shares
in excess of the Companys then authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock
(including, for purposes of this Section 1.05, as authorized and unissued
shares of Common Stock any Shares held in the treasury of the Company); (iii)
Purchaser shall, concurrently with the exercise of the Top-Up Option, give
written notice to the Company that as promptly as practicable following such
exercise, Purchaser intends to (and Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, as promptly as  



 

6  practicable after such exercise) consummate the Merger in accordance with
Section 253 of the Corporation Law as contemplated by Section 2.09; and (iv)
the Top-Up Option may not be exercised if any provision of applicable law
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include the rules and regulations
of NASDAQ which shall not apply) or any judgment, injunction, order or decree
shall prohibit, or require any action or consent, approval, authorization or
permit of any Governmental Entity or the Companys stockholders in connection
with the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares in
respect of such exercise, which action, consent, approval, authorization or
permit has not theretofore been obtained or made, as applicable.

(b) Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Shares may include any legends
required by applicable securities laws.

(c) Parent and Purchaser understand that the Shares that Purchaser may
acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and will be
issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not
involving a public offering. Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the
Company that Purchaser is, or will be upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, an
"accredited investor" (as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated
under the Securities Act). Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option and the
Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise thereof are being and will be
acquired for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale in
connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities
Act.

ARTICLE III

DISSENTING SHARES; PAYMENT FOR SHARES; OPTIONS

SECTION 3.01. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by stockholders properly exercising appraisal
rights available under Section 262 of the Corporation Law (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the
Corporation Law. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section
262 of the Corporation Law. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively  



 

9  waived, withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holders Shares
shall thereupon be converted into the right to receive, as of the later of
the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal shall have been
irrevocably lost, waived, withdrawn or expired, the Merger Consideration
without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent and Purchaser (a)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
Corporation Law and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the
"fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the
Corporation Law, and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the Corporation Law.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of
capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or settle any demands or approve
any withdrawal of any such demands.

SECTION 3.02. _Payment for Shares_. (a) From time to time after the Effective
Time, Parent will cause Purchaser to make available to a bank or trust
company located in the United States designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") sufficient funds to make
the payments due pursuant to Section 2.06 on a timely basis to holders of
Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such funds being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ ").
Purchaser shall provide irrevocable instructions to the Paying Agent to, make
the payments provided for in the preceding sentence, on a timely basis, out of
the Payment Fund. Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_
, that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of Shares and, following any losses,
Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses
and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of or guaranteed
by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1
or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except
as provided in this Agreement. 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event within ten days after
the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding
certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented Shares (other than Shares owned by Parent
or Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or held in the treasury
of the Company, and other than Dissenting Shares), a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificate and receiving payment therefor. Following
surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid in
exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax
as specified in Section 2.10) equal to the product of the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and
such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. If
payment is to be made to a Person (as defined in Section 9.10(f)) other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is  



 

10  registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.02, each Certificate shall
represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with
the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration in cash multiplied by the number of
Shares evidenced by such Certificate, without any interest thereon.

(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making on an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the
Shares formerly represented thereby.

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the
Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be repaid to the
Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not
complied with Section 3.01 prior to the end of such six-month period shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws), but only as general creditors
thereof, for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
to any holder of Shares for any monies delivered from the Payment Fund or
otherwise to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and
expenses of the Paying Agent in connection with the exchange of Shares for the
Merger Consideration.

SECTION 3.03. _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. No transfer of
Shares shall be made in the stock transfer books of the Company after the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article III, subject
to applicable law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

SECTION 3.04. _Options and Other Equity Awards_. (a) Each option or right to
acquire Shares (the " _Options_ ") granted under any stock option or similar
plan of the Company or under any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party (the " _Option Plans_ ") which is outstanding at the
Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, be
converted into and shall become a right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, with respect to each Share subject thereto equal to the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise or purchase
price of such Option. At the Effective Time, each holder of an Option shall be
entitled to receive, not later than five Business Days after the Effective
Time, in full satisfaction of such Option, an amount in cash without interest
in respect thereof equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the per share exercise or  



 

11  purchase price of such Option and (b) the number of Shares subject to such
Option (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Option Consideration_ "), and each Option shall be canceled at the Effective
Time. Such payment shall be reduced by any income or employment tax
withholding required under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of such Option. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board shall exercise its authority under each Option Plan to determine that
each Option shall be converted, at the Effective Time, in the manner described
in this Section 3.04(a). The Option Plans shall terminate as of the Effective
Time and any and all rights under any provisions in any other plan, program
or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in
respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof shall be
canceled as of the Effective Time. All administrative and other rights
and authorities granted under any Option Plan to the Company, the Company
Board or any committee or designee thereof, shall, following the Effective
Time, reside with the Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Other Equity Based Awards_. Each incentive award or other right relating
to, or the value of which is based on the value of, Shares (an " _Equity
Award_ ") that was granted under any employee incentive or similar plan of the
Company or under any agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party (an " _Equity Plan_ ") and that is outstanding at the Effective
Time, whether or not vested, shall by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and
shall become a right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
determined pursuant to the terms thereof based on the value of a Share being
equal to the Merger Consideration. Each holder of an Equity Award shall be
entitled to receive, not later than five Business Day after the Effective
Time, in full satisfaction of such Equity Award, an amount in cash without
interest determined pursuant to the terms thereof based on the value of a
Share being equal to the Merger Consideration and each Equity Award shall be
cancelled at the Effective Time. Such payment shall be reduced by any income
or employment tax withholding required under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of such Equity Award. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company Board shall exercise its authority under each Equity Plan to
determine that each Equity Award shall be converted, at the Effective
Time, in the manner described in this Section 3.04(b). The Equity Plans shall
terminate as of the Effective Time and any and all rights under any provisions
in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant
of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof shall be canceled as of the Effective Time. All
administrative and other rights and authorities granted under any Equity Plan
to the Company, the Company Board of Directors or any committee or designee
thereof, shall, following the Effective Time, reside with the Surviving
Corporation.

OF THE COMPANY

With respect to any Section of this Article IV, except as (i) disclosed in the

and prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Existing Company SEC Reports_
") (excluding, in each case, any disclosure set forth in any "risk factor"
section (other than factual information contained therein) and in any section
relating to forward-looking statements), but only to the extent applicability
of such disclosure to such section is reasonably apparent on its face, or (ii)
set forth in the section of the disclosure letter dated the date hereof and
delivered by the Company to Parent with respect to this Agreement (the "
_Disclosure Letter_ ") that specifically relates to such Section or another
section of the Disclosure Letter to the extent that the applicability of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face, the Company represents
and warrants to Parent and Purchaser as follows:

SECTION 4.01. _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the

corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct its business
as currently conducted and is duly qualified or licensed to do business and in
good standing or has comparable status as a foreign entity authorized to do
business in each of the jurisdictions in which the character of the properties
owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by it
makes such qualification necessary, except where any such failures to be so
qualified and in good standing have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
(as defined in Section 9.10(e)). The Company has heretofore made available to
Parent and Purchaser accurate and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or similar governing documents) as currently in
effect for the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, owns any interest in any
Person other than in the Companys Subsidiaries and except for investments of
any Plan of the Company.

SECTION 4.02. _Capitalization_. (a) The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 100,000,000 Shares, and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred

its Shares. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are free of

referred to collectively as " _Company Securities_ ") or (iv) obligations by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the

36 (t) convene any regular or special meeting (or any adjournment thereof) of the
stockholders of the Company other than the Special Meeting contemplated by

SECTION 6.02. _No Solicitation_. (a) The Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries not to and shall not permit its and their respective
officers, directors, employees, representatives (including investment bankers,
attorneys and accountants) and agents to, directly or indirectly, solicit,
initiate, participate in any way in, or knowingly encourage any discussions
or negotiations with respect to, or provide any information, or afford any
access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or otherwise take any action to knowingly assist, any Person in
respect of, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to
compliance with Section 6.02(c), upon the prior execution by such Person of
a confidentiality agreement that is no less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company may, at any time prior to the purchase
of Shares pursuant to the Offer, furnish information (so long as all such
information has previously been made available to Parent or is made available
to Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is made available to such
Person) to or enter into discussions or negotiations with any Person that has
made an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal not resulting from a
breach of this Section 6.02 received after the date hereof that the Company
Board (after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside
counsel and after taking into account the legal, financial, financing,
regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal, to the extent
known) determines is or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal
if, and only to the extent (i) that the Company has complied with
its obligations under this Section 6.02, (ii) that, and for so long as, the
Company Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company,
determines in good faith that failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable law and (iii) the Company has promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) provided Parent written notice of its intent to take any such
action (which notice shall include the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and the terms of such Acquisition Proposal). The Company
will keep Parent and Purchaser reasonably informed of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations and shall promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) notify Parent and Purchaser orally and in writing of any modifications
to the financial or other material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal.

(b) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents and
Affiliates to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions, or negotiations with any Persons other than Parent,
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or Associates conducted prior
to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Unless and until this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
Section 8.01 and except as expressly permitted by Section 6.02(d) or (e),
neither the Company  



 

37  nor the Company Board shall (i) withdraw, modify or qualify, or publicly
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent
or Purchaser, the approval or recommendation of the Offer or the Merger as
described in Section 1.02(a)(ii), (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) release any
third party from any confidentiality (in the context of an Acquisition
Proposal) or standstill agreement to which the Company is a party, or fail to
enforce to the fullest extent possible, or grant any waiver, request or
consent to any Acquisition Proposal under, any such agreement, or (iv)
otherwise enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement with a
Person making an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 6.02(a)) related to
any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii), a
" _Change of Recommendation_ "). Without limiting any other rights of Parent
and Purchaser under this Agreement in respect of any such action, any Change
of Recommendation or any termination of this Agreement shall not have any
effect on the approvals of, and other actions referred to herein for the
purpose of causing the Takeover Laws and the Confidentiality Agreement to be
inapplicable to, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
which approvals and actions are irrevocable.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.02(c), the Company Board may
effect a Change of Recommendation if the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do
so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the
Company under applicable law and, in the case where such determination is made
in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company has provided Parent prior
written notice of its intent to take such action not less than three Business
Days prior to taking such action and has otherwise complied with the
negotiation provisions contained in Section 8.01(e).

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.02 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_
, that such action will be deemed to constitute a Change of Recommendation
unless the disclosure (i) is of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act, or (ii) rejects or recommends against the Acquisition
Proposal and reaffirms the Company Boards recommendation of the Offer or the
Merger.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
offer or proposal, or any indication of interest in making an offer or
proposal, made in writing by a Person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3)
of the Exchange Act) at any time which is structured to permit such Person or
group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least 15% of the assets of,
equity interest in, or businesses of, the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, pursuant to a merger, recapitalization, consolidation or other
business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, sale of assets, tender
offer or exchange offer or similar transaction, including any single or multi-
step transaction or series of related transactions, in each case other than
the Offer and the Merger and (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any
unsolicited, bona fide Acquisition Proposal (except the reference therein to
"15%" shall be replaced by "50%") that is on terms that the Company Board has
reasonably determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside
financial advisor and outside counsel and after taking into account the legal,
financial, financing, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal) would
result in a  



 

38  transaction that is (x) more favorable from a financial point of view to the
Companys stockholders than the Offer and the Merger, and (y) is reasonably
likely to be consummated on the terms proposed.

SECTION 6.03. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. (a) Subject to
restrictions under applicable law, from and after the date of this Agreement
to the earlier of (i) the date on which a majority of the Companys directors
are designees of Parent or Purchaser and (ii) the Effective Time, the Company
will (i) give Parent and Purchaser and their authorized accountants,
investment bankers, counsel and other representatives access (during regular
business hours upon reasonable notice) to all employees, plants,
offices, warehouses and other facilities and to all books, contracts,
commitments and records (including Tax returns) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and use reasonable best efforts to cause the Companys and its
Subsidiaries independent public accountants to provide access to their work
papers and such other information as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably
request, (ii) permit Parent and Purchaser to make such inspections (during
regular business hours upon reasonable notice) as they may reasonably
request, (iii) cause its officers and those of its Subsidiaries to furnish
Parent and Purchaser with such financial and operating data and other
information with respect to the business, properties and Personnel of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or Purchaser may from time to time
reasonably request and (iv) furnish promptly to Parent and Purchaser a copy of
each report, schedule and other document filed or received by the Company
during such period pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state
securities laws; _provided_ , that none of Purchaser, Parent nor any of their
representatives shall be permitted to perform any invasive testing or
environmental sampling.

 

(b) Information obtained by Parent or Purchaser and their respective officers,
employees, auditors, accountants and other authorized
representatives pursuant to Section 6.03(a) shall be subject to the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall require the Company to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the judgment of the
Company would (i) violate any of its respective obligations with respect to
confidentiality, or (ii) result in a violation of applicable law.

SECTION 6.04. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate Parent or Purchaser to keep the Offer open beyond the expiration
date set forth in the Offer (as it may be extended from time to time in
accordance with this Agreement or as required by applicable law). Without
limiting the foregoing, (i) each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to make promptly any required
submissions under the HSR Act, and any submissions under any other applicable
foreign antitrust or competition laws of jurisdictions other than the United
States that are required to be made or which the Company and Parent mutually
agree should be made, in each case, with respect to the Offer, the Merger and
the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) Parent, Purchaser and the
Company shall  



 

39  cooperate with one another (A) in promptly determining whether any filings
are required to be or should be made or consents, approvals, permits
or authorizations are required to be or should be obtained under any other
supranational, national, federal, state or local law or regulation or whether
any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or should be obtained
from other parties to loan agreements or other contracts or instruments
material to the Companys business in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) in promptly making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and
seeking to obtain timely any consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or
waivers required to be made or which the Company and Parent mutually agree
should be made.

(b) In the event that any action, suit, proceeding or investigation relating
hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby is commenced,
whether before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to
cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend vigorously against
it and respond thereto and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent, Purchaser or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to agree (i) to limit in any manner
whatsoever or not to exercise any rights of ownership of any securities
(including the Shares), or to divest, dispose of or hold separate any
securities or all or a portion of their respective businesses, assets or
properties or of the business, assets or properties of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (ii) to limit in any manner whatsoever the ability of such
entities (A) to conduct their respective businesses or own such assets or
properties or to conduct the businesses or own the properties or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or (B) to control their respective businesses
or operations or the businesses or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

SECTION 6.05. _Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) Parent and Purchaser agree
that the Surviving Corporations Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and
the articles of organization, bylaws or similar constituent documents of any
of the Companys Subsidiaries, shall contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification of the present or former directors, officers and
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries than are currently
provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, and the
articles of organization, bylaws or similar constituent documents of any of
the Companys Subsidiaries, as the case may be, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals until the expiration of
the statutes of limitations applicable to such matters or unless such
amendment, modification or repeal is required by applicable law.

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Person may have under any
agreement or Plan, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the
Effective Time) and former officer and director of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements,
incurred in connection with any  



 

40  proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was
an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, to the extent permitted under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation
or Bylaws as of the date hereof. In the event of any such Proceeding, each
Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the
defense of the Proceeding from the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent
such Persons have the right to advancement of expenses from the Company as of
the date of this Agreement, and the Surviving Corporation shall provide such
advancement of expenses. The Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate
with the Indemnified Parties in the defense of any such matter.

(c) The Surviving Corporation will cause to be maintained in effect for a
period of six years after the Effective Time, in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time (but only in respect thereof), policies
of directors and officers liability insurance, or a six-year tail insurance
policy, covering the Persons currently covered by the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance policies and providing coverage
at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as such existing policies; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation will not be required in order to
maintain such directors and officers liability insurance policies to pay
aggregate premium in excess of 150% of the aggregate annual amounts currently
paid by the Company to maintain the existing policies (which amount is as set
forth in Schedule 6.05); and _provided_ , _further_ that, if equivalent
coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying aggregate
premium in excess of 150% of such annual amount, the Surviving Corporation
shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying
aggregate premium equal to 150% of such annual amount. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and in lieu thereof, the Company may, at its election and subject
to Parents reasonable consent, purchase a six-year tail insurance policy,
covering the Persons currently covered by the Companys existing directors
and officers liability insurance policies and providing coverage not
more favorable, in the aggregate, than such existing policies, such tail
insurance policy to become effective upon the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the aggregate premium that the Company will be required to
pay for such tail insurance policy shall not exceed 200% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company to maintain the existing policies.

(d) This Section 6.05 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, any Person or entity
referred to in clause (a) of this Section 6.05 (whether or not parties to this
Agreement). If the Surviving Corporation or any its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity resulting from such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to make proper provision so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
applicable obligations set forth in this Section 6.05.

SECTION 6.06. _Employee Matters_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, except as
set forth below, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, and
from and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor, in accordance with their terms all existing employment
and severance agreements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
any officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
specified in Section 4.09(a) of the Disclosure Letter. 



 

41 (b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries,
for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, to maintain for the individuals employed by the Company
at the Effective Time (i) the same level of annual base compensation as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) benefits provided
under the Plans that in the aggregate are substantially no less favorable than
the benefits maintained for and provided to such employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time (excluding, for this purpose, benefits that are
contingent on a change in control or that are based on the value of, or
require the issuance of, securities). Bonuses or incentive compensation for
2007 shall be paid in accordance with the applicable terms of any Company
bonus or incentive compensation plan in effect for 2007. Nothing in this
Section 6.06(b) shall be deemed to constitute an amendment of any Plan or to
prevent the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from making any
change in any Plan, including any change required by law or deemed necessary
or appropriate to comply with applicable law or regulation. Nothing in this
Section 6.06(b) shall limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any employee at any
time.

(c) The Company shall take, or cause to be taken, all action necessary, as
promptly hereafter as reasonably practicable, to amend any Plan maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to eliminate, as of the date hereof,
all provisions for the purchase from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
Company Securities or Subsidiary Securities.

(d) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service
rendered by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time to be taken into account for vesting and eligibility purposes
(but not for accrual purposes, except for vacation and severance, if
applicable) under employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent as such service was
taken into account under the corresponding Plans of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for those purposes. Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
will not be subject to any pre-existing condition limitation under any health
plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any
condition for which they would have been entitled to coverage under the
corresponding plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which they
participated prior to the Effective Time. Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to give such employees credit
under such plans for co-payments made and deductibles satisfied prior to the
Effective Time.

(e) No later than two Business Days prior to its distribution, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall provide Parent and Purchaser with a copy of any
communication intended to be made to any of their respective employees
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and will provide an
opportunity for Parent and Purchaser to make reasonable revisions thereto.

(f) This Section 6.06 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.06,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.06.



 

42 SECTION 6.07. _Takeover Laws_. The Company shall, upon the request of Parent
or Purchaser, take all reasonable steps to exclude the applicability of, or
to assist in any challenge by Parent or Purchaser to the validity, or
applicability to the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
by this Agreement or the Stockholder Support Agreement of, any Takeover Laws.

SECTION 6.08. _Proxy Statement_. Unless the Merger is consummated in
accordance with Section 253 of the Corporation Law as contemplated by Section
2.09, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, subject to the prior
review and approval of Parent and Purchaser (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld), as soon as practicable after the consummation of the
Offer, a preliminary Proxy Statement (the " _Preliminary Proxy Statement_ ")
relating to the Merger as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. The Company shall obtain and furnish the information
required to be included in the Preliminary Proxy Statement, shall provide
Parent and Purchaser with, and consult with Parent and Purchaser regarding,
any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect
thereto, shall, subject to the prior review and approval of Parent and
Purchaser (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), respond
promptly to any such comments made by the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Preliminary Proxy Statement, and shall cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Companys stockholders at the earliest practicable date. If at
any time prior to the Special Meeting, any information relating to the Offer,
the Merger, the Company, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement, so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which

notice to Parent and Purchaser, and Parent or Purchaser, as the case may be,
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence, or non-occurrence,
of any event the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which is likely (a) to
cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in
this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect if made as
of any time at or prior to the Effective Time or (b) to result in any material
failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied hereunder (including the Offer
Conditions); _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 6.09 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to any of the parties receiving such notice.

SECTION 6.10. _Press Releases_. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior consent of
the Company and Parent  



 

43  (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
such release or announcement may be required by applicable law or the rules
or regulations of any applicable securities exchange or regulatory or
governmental body to which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever
situated, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable
time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance,
it being understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of
the disclosing party.

SECTION 6.11. _Treatment of Senior Notes_. (a) Provided that the provisions
of Sections 6.11(e) and 6.11(f) are satisfied, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, at the written request of Parent, use their
reasonable best efforts to commence, simultaneously with the commencement of
the Offer or at any time thereafter, or Parent or any of its Affiliates may
at any time commence, an offer to purchase (the " _Debt Offer_ ") all of the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 8.875% Senior Notes due 2015
(the " _Senior Notes_ "), and/or to solicit the consent (the " _Consent
Solicitation_ ", together with the Debt Offer, the " _Debt Transaction_ ") of
the holders of the Senior Notes to certain amendments to the indenture
governing the Senior Notes (the " _Indenture Amendments_ "), in each case, on
terms and conditions in this Section 6.11 and otherwise specified by Parent;
_provided_ , that the Indenture Amendments shall be set forth in the offer
to purchase, related letter of transmittal, consent solicitation and/or other
related documents (collectively, the " _Debt Transaction Documents_ ")
necessary to consummate the Debt Transaction and the Company shall not be
required to commence any Debt Transaction until Parent shall have provided
the Company with the Debt Transaction Documents; _provided_ , _further_ , that
prior to the Effective Time, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to (i) make any cash expenditures in connection with the
Debt Transaction or (ii) take any action that could obligate the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase any Senior Notes or incur any additional
obligations to the holders of the Senior Notes prior to the consummation of
the Debt Transaction. Any mailings to holders of the Senior Notes shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of the Company and Parent. The terms and
conditions specified by Parent for the Debt Transaction shall be only such
terms and such conditions as are customarily included in similar transaction
involving debt securities similar to the Senior Notes and otherwise in
compliance with applicable laws. If the Debt Transaction is commenced prior
to the Effective Time, the closing of the Debt Transaction shall be expressly
conditioned on the completion of the Merger, and the Debt Transaction shall in
all cases be conducted in compliance with applicable laws, including SEC rules
and regulations. None of the Senior Notes shall be required to be purchased
prior to the Effective Time. The Company, Purchaser and Parent shall, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, and shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective representatives to, provide
cooperation and assistance reasonably requested by the other in connection
with the Debt Transaction.

(b) Subject to Sections 6.11(e) and 6.11(f), if requested by Parent in
writing, in lieu of (or in addition of) commencing a Debt Transaction for the
Senior Notes, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, to the
extent permitted by the indenture governing the Senior Notes, take all
actions reasonably requested by Parent that are reasonably necessary for the
discharge or defeasance of the Senior Notes pursuant to the applicable
provisions of the indenture governing the Senior Notes, and shall discharge
or defease, as applicable, the Senior  



 

44  Notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the Senior
Notes at the Effective Time (the " _Debt Defeasance_ ");  _provided_ , that
(i) in no event shall the Company be required to consummate the Debt
Defeasance, provide any irrevocable notice of the Debt Defeasance or take any
other irrevocable act regarding the Debt Defeasance prior to the
Expiration Date, (ii) to the extent that the Debt Defeasance can be
conditioned on the completion of the Merger, it will be so conditioned, (iii)
prior to the Company being required to take any actions in connection with the
Debt Defeasance that cannot be conditioned on the completion of the Merger,
Parent shall set aside, or shall cause to be set aside, sufficient funds to
deliver to the Company to effect such discharge or defeasance, and (iv) prior
to the Company being required to take any actions in connection with the Debt
Defeasance, Parent shall deliver to, or shall cause to be delivered to, the
Company or a paying agent identified by the Company to Parent and reasonably
acceptable to Parent sufficient funds to enable the Company to effect such
discharge or defeasance. The Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective representatives to, provide cooperation and assistance
reasonably requested by the other in connection with the Debt Defeasance.

(c) Subject to Section 6.11(a), the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, waive any of the conditions to the Debt Transaction (other
than that the Merger shall have been consummated and that there shall be no
law, injunction or other legal restraint prohibiting consummation of the Debt
Transaction) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and shall not, without
the written consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Transaction or
make any changes to the Debt Transaction other than as agreed in writing
between Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
make any change to the terms and conditions of the Debt Transaction requested
by Parent that decreases the price per Senior Note payable in the Debt
Transaction or imposes conditions to the Debt Transaction are adverse to the
holders of the Senior Notes, unless such change is previously approved by the
Company in writing.

(d) The Company covenants and agrees that, if the Debt Transaction is or
includes a Consent Solicitation, promptly following the Consent
Solicitation expiration date, assuming the requisite consent of holders of
the Senior Notes to authorize the Indenture Amendments (the " _Requisite
Consent_ ") is received, each of the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries
as is necessary shall (and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the applicable trustee to) execute supplemental indentures to the
indenture governing the Senior Notes, which supplemental indentures shall
implement the Indenture Amendments and shall become operative only
concurrently with or after the completion of the Merger, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement (including the conditions to the Debt
Transaction). Concurrently with the completion of the Debt Transaction,
Parent shall provide to the Company necessary funds and the Company will
accept for payment and thereafter promptly make any payment required to be
made to holders of the Senior Notes pursuant to the terms of the Debt
Transaction Documents.

(e) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with the Debt Transaction and the Debt Defeasance. Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
reasonably cooperate with each other in the  



 

45  preparation of the Debt Transaction Documents, the Debt Defeasance documents
and any other necessary documentation. The Debt Transaction Documents
(including all amendments or supplements thereto), the Debt Defeasance
documents and all mailings to the holders of the Senior Notes in connection
with the Debt Transaction or the Debt Defeasance shall be subject to the prior
review of, and comment by, the Company and Parent and shall be reasonably
acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion of the Debt
Transaction, any information should be discovered by the Company or Parent
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Debt
Transaction Documents, so that the Debt Transaction Documents shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement prepared by
Parent describing such information shall be disseminated by or on behalf of
the Company to the holders of the Senior Notes (which supplement or amendment
and dissemination may, at the reasonable direction of Parent, take the form of
a filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 6.11(e), the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-l under the Exchange
Act and any other applicable law to the extent such laws are applicable in
connection with the Debt Transaction and such compliance will not be deemed a
breach hereof.

(f) In connection with the Debt Transaction and the Debt Defeasance, Parent
may select one or more dealer managers, information agents, depositaries and
other agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company,
to provide assistance in connection therewith and the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary agreements (including
indemnities) with such parties so selected. Parent shall pay the fees and out-
of-pocket expenses of any dealer manager, information agent, depositary or
other agent retained in connection with the Debt Transaction and the Debt
Defeasance upon the incurrence of such fees and out-of-pocket expenses, and
Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
of their reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection
with the Debt Transaction and the Debt Defeasance promptly following the
incurrence thereof. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and each of their respective officers and directors from
and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interests, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any such
Person, or to which any such Person may become subject, that arises out of or
in connection with the Debt Transaction or the Debt Defeasance, or any actions
taken or not taken by the Company or at the direction of the Company pursuant
to this Section 6.11 or at the request of Parent. 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.11, in the
event that Parent wishes to consummate the Debt Transaction or the Debt
Defeasance prior to the Effective Time, and Parent delivers or causes to be
delivered to the Company, or a paying agent identified by the Company and
reasonably acceptable to Parent, sufficient funds to consummate such Debt
Transaction or Debt Defeasance, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts to commence and consummate
such Debt Transaction or Debt Defeasance prior to the Effective Time and
otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Section 6.11.



 

46 SECTION 6.12. _Termination of Certain Other Indebtedness_. On or after the
Expiration Date, subject to Parent making available the necessary funds to do
so, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use reasonable efforts to, (i) repay all outstanding amounts
under and terminate the Amended and Restated Financing Agreement, dated
February 15, 2007, between the Lenders party thereto, U.S. Bank National
Association, as Agent, and OpCo, as Borrower, or any other credit facility or
instrument of indebtedness that by its terms is prepayable or repayable at
such time, and all related contracts to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, and (ii) to the extent the related facility is
terminated pursuant to this Section 6.12, cause to be released any liens on
its assets relating to those facilities or instruments of indebtedness.

SECTION 6.13. _Consent to Funding_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the terms and conditions of any funding provided by Parent
or any of its Affiliates to either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to Section 6.11 or Section 6.12 shall be (i) if provided prior to
the Expiration Date, subject to the consent of the Company Board, and (ii) if
provided after the Expiration Date but prior to the Effective Time, subject to
the consent of the Continuing Directors, if any. 

SECTION 6.14. _Section 16_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall take all steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to Shares) resulting from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act in accordance with the interpretative guidance of the SEC.

TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER

SECTION 8.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer
and the Merger may be abandoned at any time (notwithstanding approval thereof
by the stockholders of the Company, if required) prior to the Effective Time
(with any termination by Parent also being an effective termination by
Purchaser): 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either Parent or the Company if any court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling, or
taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling
or other action shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , that
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.01(b) shall have used its reasonable best efforts to contest and remove such
order, decree, ruling or action;

(c) by the Company if (i) Purchaser fails to commence the Offer as required
pursuant to Section 1.01, (ii) Parent or Purchaser breaches or fails to
perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A)

Purchaser to consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (B) cannot be or has not been cured within
ten Business Days after Parents receipt of written notice from the Company of
such breach, (iii) Purchaser shall not have accepted for payment and paid for
Shares pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the terms thereof on or
before the date that is 90 days from the date of the commencement of the Offer
(the " _Outside Date_ ") or the Offer shall have expired or been terminated
without Purchaser having purchased any Shares pursuant thereto or (iv)
Purchaser fails to purchase validly tendered Shares in violation of the terms
of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 8.01(c) if
the Company is then in material breach of any of its covenants contained in
this Agreement, or pursuant to clause (i) or (iii) of this Section 8.01(c) if
the failure of Purchaser to commence the Offer or to accept for payment and
pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer by the Outside Date or such expiration or
termination of the Offer resulted from the Companys failure to perform any of
its obligations under this Agreement. 

(d) by Parent if (i) the Company breaches or fails to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in paragraph (2)(b) of Exhibit A and (B)

Companys receipt of written notice from Parent of such breach, or (ii)
Purchaser shall not have accepted for payment Shares pursuant to the Offer

pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 8.01(d) if the failure of
Purchaser to accept for payment and pay for Shares pursuant to the Offer by
the Outside Date or such expiration or termination of the Offer resulted from
Parents or Purchasers failure to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement; 

(e) by the Company, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, if
(i) the Company has complied with its obligations under Section 6.02, (ii)
(A) the Company has given Parent and Purchaser at least three Business Days
advance written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") of its intention
to accept or recommend a Superior Proposal and of all of the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person
making the Superior Proposal and copies of all proposed forms of agreements
and any amendments thereto) and (B) Parent and Purchaser do not, within three
Business Days of receipt by Parent and Purchaser of the Notice of Superior
Proposal, make an offer that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) to
be at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , that during such three Business Day period, the Company
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and Purchaser (to the extent that
Parent and Purchaser wish to negotiate) to enable Parent and Purchaser to
make such an offer; and _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the event of any
amendment to the financial or other material terms of such Superior Proposal,
the Company Board shall deliver to Parent and Purchaser an additional written
Notice of Superior Proposal, and the three Business Day period referenced
above shall be extended for an additional two Business Days after Parents and
Purchasers receipt of each such additional Notice of Superior Proposal,
(iii) the Company Board, after taking into account any modifications to the
terms of the Offer and the Merger proposed by Parent and Purchaser after
receipt of such notice, continues to believe such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (iv) the Company Board (after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) determines in
good faith that failure to accept such Superior Proposal would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable law, and (v) on the date of such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement for the
transaction contemplated by such Superior Proposal; _provided_ that the
termination described in this Section 8.01(e) shall not be effective unless
and until the Company shall have paid to Parent the Expenses and the
Termination Fee described in Section 8.03; 

(f) by Parent, prior to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer, (i) if
the Company breaches Section 6.02 in any material respect or (ii) the Company
Board effects or resolves to effect a Change of Recommendation.

SECTION 8.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and
the Merger is abandoned pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement, except for
the provisions of Sections 6.03(b), 8.02, 8.03 and Article IX (which shall
remain in effect), shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without
any liability on the part of any party or its directors, officers or
stockholders. Nothing in this Section 8.02 shall relieve any party to this
Agreement of liability for any breach of this Agreement; provided, however,
that Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that if the Company pays to Parent the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.03, then Parent and Purchaser shall not
be entitled to seek any additional money damages in respect of
the termination of this Agreement regardless of the circumstances giving rise
to such termination.



 

49 SECTION 8.03. _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Whether or not the Merger is
consummated, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Offer, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses.

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.01(e), then the Company shall reimburse Parent for all of the out-
of-pocket expenses of Parent and the Purchaser (including printing fees,
filing fees and expenses of its legal, financial and other advisors) related
to the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby and any related financing up to a maximum of $2,150,000 (collectively,
the " _Expenses_ ") and pay Parent an additional termination fee equal to
$12,400,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), in each case, in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by Parent. If such
amounts become payable, they shall be payable simultaneously with such
termination.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.01(f), the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee and the
Expenses in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
designated by Parent on the Business Day following such termination.

(d) In the event that (i) (A) this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 8.01(c)(iii) or Section 8.01(d)(ii), and (B) prior to the event
giving rise to such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made
or publicly announced, then the Company shall reimburse Parent for the
Expenses, and (ii) within 12 months following the date of such termination,
an Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated or the Company shall have
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(any such event described in this clause (ii), a " _Subsequent Transaction_
"), then the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee, in each case in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by
Parent. If any amounts become payable pursuant to clause (i), then they shall
be payable simultaneously with such termination (in the case of a termination
by the Company) or within one Business Day thereafter (in the case of a
termination by Parent). If such amounts become payable pursuant to clause
(ii), they shall be payable simultaneously with the earlier of completion of
such Acquisition Proposal and the Companys entering into such a definitive
agreement. For purposes of the definition of Subsequent Transaction and this
Section 8.03, each reference to 15% in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be replaced with a reference to 50%.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be required to pay the
Termination Fee more than once.

(f) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, neither Parent nor the Purchaser would
have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, in the event that the Company
shall fail to reimburse the Expenses pay the  



 

50  Termination Fee when due, and in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit or other proceeding which results in a judgment or similar
award against the Company for reimbursement of the Expenses or payment of the
Termination Fee, then the Company shall reimburse Parent for its reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses of
enforcement) in connection with such suit or proceeding, together with
interest on the amounts owed at the prime lending rate prevailing at such
time, as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus two percent per annum from
the date such amounts were required to be paid until the date actually
received by Parent.

SECTION 8.04. _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
this Agreement may be amended by action taken by or on behalf of the Company
Board and the Boards of Directors of Parent and Purchaser, subject in the case
of the Company to Section 1.04(b), at any time before or after adoption of
this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company but, after any such
stockholder approval, no amendment shall be made which decreases the Merger
Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of the Companys
stockholders hereunder without the approval of the stockholders of the
Company. This Agreement may not be amended, changed, supplemented or otherwise
modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the
parties.

SECTION 8.05. _Extension; Waiver; Remedies_. (a) At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken by or on behalf of the
Company Board and the Boards of Directors of Parent and Purchaser, subject in
the case of the Company to Section 1.04(b), may (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein by any other applicable party or in any document, certificate
or writing delivered pursuant hereto by any other applicable party or (iii)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party.

(b) All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise
available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not
alternative, and the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude
the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by
such party. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any rights, power or
remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof
at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto
with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties
at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver by such
party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to
demand such compliance.

  _EXHIBIT A_

_CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER_

Capitalized terms used in this Exhibit A and not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement to which it
is attached (the " _Merger Agreement_ ").

1. Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Merger Agreement,
Purchaser shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-l(c) under the
Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return
tendered Shares promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to
pay for any Shares tendered in connection with the Offer and may terminate or,
subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, amend the Offer, unless,
immediately prior to the expiration of the offering period for the Offer, as
the same may (or, to the extent required by the Merger Agreement, shall) be
extended from time to time (the " _Expiration Date_ ") (a) there shall be
validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn that number of Shares
which, together with the number of Shares, if any, then owned beneficially by
Parent or Purchaser or any Affiliate of either of them, constitutes at least
a majority of the total number of outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis
(which shall mean, as of any time, the number of Shares outstanding, together
with all Shares which the Company may be required to issue pursuant to any
then outstanding warrants, options, benefit plans or obligations or securities
convertible or exchangeable into Shares or otherwise, whether or not vested or
then exercisable) (the " _Minimum Tender Condition_ "), and (b) any waiting
period under the HSR Act in respect of the Offer or the Merger shall have
expired or been terminated or, where applicable, any required approval
thereunder shall have been obtained.

2\. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be
required to accept for payment or, subject as aforesaid, to pay for
any Shares tendered in the Offer if, at any time on or after the date of the
Merger Agreement and prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares, any of the
following conditions exist:

(a) there shall have been any statute, rule, regulation, legislation,
judgment, order or injunction, promulgated, enacted, entered, enforced,
issued or amended by any Governmental Entity that is applicable to Parent,
Purchaser, the Company, the Offer or the Merger that (1) makes the acceptance
for payment of, or payment for or purchase of some or all of the Shares
pursuant to the Offer illegal, (2) imposes material limitations on the
ability of Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
acquire or hold, transfer or dispose of, or effectively to exercise all rights
of ownership of, some or all of the Shares including the right to vote the
Shares purchased by it pursuant to the Offer on an equal basis with all other
Shares on all matters properly presented to the stockholders of the Company,
(3) imposes any material limitations on the ability of Parent, Purchaser or
any of their respective Subsidiaries effectively to control the business or
operations of the Company, Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or (4) otherwise prohibits the Offer or the Merger; or



 

A-1 (b) (i) the Company shall have breached or failed to comply in any material
respect with any of its obligations, covenants, or agreements under the
Merger Agreement or (ii) (A) the Companys representations and warranties
contained in Section 4.02(a) (Capitalization), except for de minimis
deviations, and Section 4.06(a) (Absence of Certain ChangesNo Material
Adverse Effect) shall not be true and correct in all respects or (B) the
Companys representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement
other than those referred to in clause (ii)(A) above shall not be true and
correct in all respects (determined without regard to any materiality or
"Material Adverse Effect" qualifier therein), except for such breaches of
representations and warranties, that in the aggregate, have not had and would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect;

which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or Purchaser, in any case, and
regardless of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent or
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates that is not otherwise prohibited by law
(including Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act) or by this Agreement) giving
rise to any such condition, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or
with acceptance for payment or payment for Shares.

3\. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be
required to accept for payment or, subject as aforesaid, to pay for
any Shares tendered in the Offer and may terminate the Offer if, at any time
on or after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to the acceptance for
payment of Shares, any of the following conditions exist:

(a) there shall have occurred any change, condition, event or development that
has had or could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; or

(b) the Merger Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms or
shall have been amended pursuant to its terms to provide for such termination
or amendment of the Offer;

which, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or Purchaser, in any case, and
regardless of the circumstances (including any action or inaction by Parent or
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates that is not otherwise prohibited by law
(including Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act) or by this Agreement) giving
rise to any such condition, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or
with acceptance for payment or payment for Shares.

The foregoing conditions are for the benefit of Parent and Purchaser and,
regardless of the circumstances, may be asserted by Parent or Purchaser
in whole or in part at any applicable time or from time to time prior to the
Expiration Date, except that the conditions relating to receipt of any
approvals from any Governmental Entity may be asserted at any time prior to
the acceptance for payment of Shares, and all conditions (except for the
Minimum Tender Condition) may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in its
discretion in whole or in part at any applicable time or from time to time, in
each case subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure of Parent or
Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed
an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
