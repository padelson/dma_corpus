Acquiror on behalf of all of the Seller Parties an itemized schedule (the "

faith estimate of all such additional Transaction Expenses that 

 



8  have been incurred but not paid or will have been incurred but not paid as

Price wired to the Major Sellers pursuant to _Section 2.9_, which shall then
be deemed payment in full of such amounts by the Major Sellers. Each Major
Seller is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

SECTION 2.12 _Closing Date Companies Purchase Price True-Up_.

(a) A written statement (the " _Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement_
") certifying in reasonable detail Acquirors good faith, reasonable
calculations of the amount of the (i) Closing Cash, (ii) Closing Indebtedness,
(iii) Closing Date Net Working Capital and the Net Working Capital Adjustment
calculated by reference thereto, (iv) Transaction Expenses, and (v) based on
the foregoing, a calculation of the Closing Date Companies Purchase Price,
shall be delivered by Acquiror to the Seller Representative as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, but not later than 60 calendar days
after the last day of the month in which the Closing occurs, together with all
data, schedules and work papers used by Acquiror in preparing the Final
Purchase Price Calculation Statement. The Seller Parties shall give Acquiror
reasonable access to any data not under the control of Acquiror or its
subsidiaries necessary to prepare the Final Purchase Price Calculation
Statement. The parties agree that the Final Purchase Price Calculation
Statement will be prepared in accordance with the Principles.

(b) The Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement shall become final and
binding on the parties on the 30th calendar day following receipt thereof by
the Seller Representative unless the Seller Representative delivers written
notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Acquiror prior
to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify the items set forth on
the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement with which the Seller
Representative disagrees and the Seller Representatives calculation of each
such amount. If a Notice of Disagreement is sent by the Seller Representative,
then the Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Date Net Working Capital,
Net Working Capital Adjustment, Transaction Expenses and Closing Date
Companies Purchase Price (as recalculated in accordance with clause (i) or
(ii) below) shall become final and binding on the parties on the earlier of
(i) the date the parties hereto resolve in writing any differences they have
with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement and (ii)
the date any disputed amounts are finally determined in accordance with the
balance of this paragraph. During the 30-day period following the delivery of
a

 



9  Notice of Disagreement, the Seller Representative and Acquiror shall seek in
good faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with
respect to any amount specified in the Notice of Disagreement or identified
by the Seller Representative during said 30-day period. If, at the end of such
30-day period, the Seller Representative and Acquiror have not reached
agreement on such amounts, the amounts which remain in dispute shall be
recalculated by an independent accounting firm (the " _Independent Accountant_
"). The Independent Accountant shall be Ernst and Young or, if such firm is
unable or unwilling to act, such other independent public accounting firm as
shall be agreed in writing by the Seller Representative and Acquiror. The
Independent Accountant shall make a ratable allocation of its charges between
the parties for such work as a part of its determination based on the
inverse proportion by which the amount in dispute was determined in favor of
one party over the other. Any amounts so recalculated shall be final and
binding on the parties.

(c) If the Closing Date Companies Purchase Price, as calculated pursuant to
this _Section 2.12_, exceeds (such excess amount, the " _Excess_ ") the
Estimated Purchase Price, then Acquiror shall cause to be paid to the Equity
Interest Sellers their respective Closing Share of an amount equal to the
Excess to their respective Designated Accounts. The respective Closing Shares
of the Colorado Sellers and the Alleyton Sellers shall reflect the relative
proportion of (i) the change in Colorado Cash as set forth in the Estimated
Purchase Price Calculation Statement as compared to that set forth in the
Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement and (ii) the change in Closing
Cash other than Colorado Cash as set forth in the Estimated Purchase Price
Calculation Statement as compared to that set forth in the Final Purchase
Price Calculation Statement.

 

(d) If the Closing Date Companies Purchase Price, as calculated pursuant to
this _Section 2.12_, is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price, then no
further payment shall be due to either Acquiror or the Equity Interest Sellers
under this _Section 2.12_.

(e) If the Closing Date Companies Purchase Price, as calculated pursuant to
this _Section 2.12_, is less than the Estimated Purchase Price (the amount of
such difference, the " _Deficiency_ "), then an amount equal to such
Deficiency shall be paid by the Equity Interest Sellers to Acquiror.

(f) Any payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ shall be made within
three Business Days after the final determination thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Acquiror or the Designated Accounts, as the case may be.

SECTION 2.13 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Sellers and Acquiror
understand and agree that the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be
treated by the Sellers as fully-taxable sales of membership interests in
Alleyton, membership interests in Colorado and assets of BSI and as asset
purchases by Acquiror and Alleyton for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For
all tax purposes, the Sellers shall allocate the consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement (including any amounts payable after the Closing
Date and any adjustments thereto) plus the amount of liabilities treated as
assumed for U.S. federal income tax purposes among the assets of the Companies
and the BSI Properties in accordance with _Schedule 2.13_. The Sellers
and Acquiror shall report, act, and file tax returns (including, but not
limited to, IRS Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent
with the allocation set forth on _Schedule 2.13_ and shall not take any
position (whether in audits, tax returns, or otherwise) that is inconsistent
with the foregoing, except as otherwise required by Law. All indemnification
payments made pursuant to this Agreement by one party to another party (other
than interest payments) shall be treated by such parties as an adjustment to
the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent permitted
by Law.

 

SECTION 2.14 _Different Consideration_. Each Equity Interest Seller
understands, acknowledges and agrees that the form(s), amount(s) and timing
of payment(s) of consideration to be paid

 



10  to such Equity Interest Seller pursuant to this Agreement in reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Equity Interest
Seller contained herein and in consideration of the sale, conveyance,
assignment, transfer and delivery of the Equity Interests and compliance with
the terms hereof, including non-compete covenants, may differ from the
form(s), amount(s) and timing of payment(s) of consideration to be paid to
any other Equity Interest Seller pursuant to this Agreement and that all of
such differences are known and agreed and each Equity Interest Seller shall
have no claims against any party with respect thereto or defenses for
enforcement hereof.

ARTICLE III.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER PARTIES

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules attached hereto with numbered
sections corresponding to the relevant section in this Article III, which
schedules may be supplemented or amended in accordance with _Section 5.16_,
(collectively, the " _Disclosure Schedules_ "), each of the Seller Parties,
and BSI and TBGSI (with respect to _Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.4_ ,
_3.7_ , _3.10_ , _3.13_ , _3.14_ , _3.16_ and _3.18_ ) jointly and severally,
represents and warrants to Acquiror, as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date, as follows:

 

SECTION 3.1 _Authority, Power and Capacity_. Each Company, BSI, CGC, TBGSI and
each Equityholder has all requisite power and authority or, if an individual,
legal capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and each of the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is a party, to perform such Persons respective
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the Transactions, and
no other equityholder or other approval is required by the Companies, BSI,
CGC, TBGSI or any Equityholder in order to consummate the Transactions. This
Agreement and all other agreements to be executed in connection herewith by
the Companies, BSI, CGC, TBGSI and each of the Equityholders have been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Companies, BSI, CGC, TBGSI and each
such Equityholder, constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the
Companies, BSI, CGC, TBGSI and each such Equityholder and is enforceable
against the Companies, BSI, CGC, TBGSI and each such Equityholder in
accordance with its terms.

SECTION 3.2 _Interests Ownership_. The Equityholders, CGC and TBGSI are the
sole record and beneficial owners of the Equity Interests and equity interests
in BSI (the " _BSI Interests_ ") in accordance with _Schedule 3.2_ hereto,
constituting 100% of such interests in each of the Companies and BSI
respectively. _Schedule 3.2_ sets forth the equity capitalization of each of
such companies and there are no other equity or similar interests
outstanding. All Equity Interests have been duly authorized and validly
issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and were issued by each Company in
compliance with all applicable federal and state securities Laws. The Equity
Interests are held, and will be held on the Closing Date, by the respective
Equity Interest Sellers free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than
Encumbrances created by this Agreement) and are not subject to any restriction
that restricts their transfer pursuant to this Agreement or that would
restrict their transferability after the Closing. The respective Equity
Interest Sellers have the right, authority and power to sell, assign and
transfer the Equity Interests to Acquiror. There is no outstanding or
authorized option, subscription, warrant, call, right, commitment or other
agreement of any character obligating either of the Companies or any of their
respective affiliates to sell or transfer any Equity Interests or other
ownership interests or any other securities convertible into or exercisable
for or evidencing the right to subscribe for any Equity Interests or other
ownership interests of either of the Companies other than rights arising
under the Buy-Sell Agreements that will be validly terminated prior to
Closing. The Equity Interest Sellers are not party to any contract, other than
this Agreement, that could require them to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose
of any of the Equity Interests. No third party, including any former owner of
Equity Interests or BSI Interests or other interests in either of the
Companies or BSI, has the basis for any claims against either of the
Companies, BSI, CGC, TBGSI, any of the Equityholders or Acquiror with respect
to the Transactions.

 



11 SECTION 3.3 _Conflicting Instruments; Consents_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery by each of the Companies, BSI, CGC, TBGSI and
each Equityholder of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the
Transactions will not, violate any provision of the respective articles of
incorporation, certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited liability company
operating agreement, certificate of formation, partnership agreement or other
charter or constituent documents (or the equivalents thereof) (collectively,
the " _Organizational Documents_ ") of the Companies, BSI, CGC, TBGSI or any
Equityholder, or except as set forth on _Schedule 3.3(a)_ , result in the

standing under the Laws of the State of Texas. Colorado is a limited
partnership, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Texas. Each Company is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation or partnership as the case may be and is in good standing
in every jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the character or location of the properties owned or leased by it makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not
be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on either Company. The
Companies and BSI (with respect to the BSI Properties) each have all requisite
corporate or other applicable power and authority to own or lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now conducted.

(b) The Organizational Documents and all amendments thereto that the
Companies previously furnished to Acquiror for review are accurate and
complete. The minute books, membership or partnership interest transfer or
stock ledger and similar records of the Companies furnished to Acquiror

of substantially all meetings of the members, partners or shareholders and the
boards of managers or board of directors, as applicable, and all committees
thereof, of the Companies. Such membership, partnership or stock interest
transfer and similar records reflect all issuances and registrations of
transfer of all membership interests, partnership interests and stock
interests and the certificates, if applicable, representing all canceled
membership interests, partnership interests or stock interests have been
appropriately reflected.

the Companies investment is accounted for by the equity method. Neither of
the Companies is a member of any partnership or joint venture agreement
or arrangement. The references to each Company in this _Article III_ shall

obligation or liability with respect to any Non-ERISA Plan, including without
limitation under any collective bargaining agreement to which either Company
is a party or by which it is bound. The Companies have made adequate accruals
on the Balance Sheets for contributions that have not been made because they
are not yet due under the terms of any Non-ERISA Plan or related agreement.

 

(c) The Companies are not in default under any Non-ERISA Plan listed on
_Schedule 3.11(b)_ ; no benefit under any Non-ERISA Plan has been increased
subsequent to the date as of which documents have been provided to Acquiror;
and the Companies have no plan, arrangement or commitment, whether legally
binding or not, to create any additional ERISA Plan or Non-ERISA Plan that
would affect any current or former employee of the Companies. There is no
action, suit or claim, other than routine claims for benefits, pending or
threatened with respect to any Non-ERISA Plan or the fiduciaries thereof, or
against the assets of any Non-ERISA Plan or the Companies.

(d) The actuarial present value of the vested and nonvested benefit
obligations under each Non-ERISA Plan (determined in a manner consistent with
_Section 3.11(b)(i)_) did not, as of such Non-ERISA Plans last valuation
date, exceed the then current fair market value of the assets held to fund
such Non-ERISA Plan. 

(e) Each ERISA Plan and Non-ERISA Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code
subject to Section 409A of the Code has been operated in compliance with the
applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code as in effect from time-to-
time.

 

(f) No agreement, commitment or obligation exists to increase any benefits
under any Non-ERISA Plan.

 

SECTION 3.12 _ERISA Plans_.

(a) Set forth on _Schedule 3.12(a)_ is a complete list of each employee
pension benefit plan (the " _Pension Plans_ ") as defined in Section 3(2) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of

 



20  1974 (" _ERISA_ ") and each employee welfare benefit plan (the " _Welfare
Plans_ " and, together with the Pension Plans, collectively referred to as
the " _ERISA Plans_ ") as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA established,
maintained or contributed to by the Companies or with respect to which the
Companies have any liability (contingent or direct). Each ERISA Plan listed
on  _Schedule 3.12(a)_ is correctly categorized as either a Pension Plan or a
Welfare Plan.

(b) The Companies have delivered to Acquiror true and correct copies of the
following:

(i) each ERISA Plan listed on _Schedule 3.12(a)_ and all amendments thereto;

(ii) each trust agreement, annuity contract or insurance policy (or any other
funding instrument) pertaining to any of the ERISA Plans, including all
amendments to such documents;

(iii) the most recent determination or opinion letter, if any, issued by the
Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") with respect to each of the Pension
Plans; and

(iv) the two most recent Annual Reports (IRS Forms 5500 series), including
Schedules A and B, if applicable, required to be filed with respect to each
ERISA Plan.

(c) The Companies do not have and have not had any liability with respect to
any defined benefit plan as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA or any
multiemployer plan as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

(d) There is no action, suit or claim pending (other than routine claims for
benefits) or that reasonably could be expected to be asserted against any
ERISA Plan or the assets of any ERISA Plan. No civil or criminal action
brought pursuant to the provisions of Title I, Subtitle B, Part 5 of ERISA is
pending or threatened against any fiduciary of any ERISA Plan. None of the
ERISA Plans or any fiduciary thereof has been the direct or indirect subject
of an audit investigation or examination by any governmental or quasi-
governmental agency.

 

(e) All of the ERISA Plans currently comply, and have complied in the past,
both as to form and operation, with the terms of such ERISA Plans and with
the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable federal
Laws. All necessary approvals from any Governmental Authority for the ERISA
Plans have been obtained and a favorable determination or opinion letter as to
the qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code of each of the Pension
Plans and of each amendment thereto has been made by the IRS and a recognition
of exemption from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code of
each of the funded Welfare Plans, if any, has been made by the IRS. Nothing
has occurred since the date of each such determination or opinion letter that
would adversely affect such qualification or exemption.

 

(f) No agreement, commitment, or obligation exists to increase any benefits
under any ERISA Plan or to adopt any new ERISA Plan. The transactions
contemplated this Agreement will not restrict the right of the Companies to
amend or terminate any ERISA Plan.

 

(g) No ERISA Plan or Non-ERISA Plan provides for post-employment health, life
insurance or other welfare benefit coverage, other than as may be required
under "COBRA" pursuant to Part VI of Title I of ERISA.

(h) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.12(h)_ , no contract, agreement, plan
or other arrangement, whether or not a Non-ERISA Plan or an ERISA Plan (other
than this Agreement), exists pursuant to which the execution of this Agreement
would trigger an obligation by the Companies to pay any amount or provide any
property to any employee, officer or director of the Companies or to
accelerate the vesting of any benefit.

 



21 SECTION 3.13 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. None of the Companies or BSI
(with respect to the BSI Properties) is, or has been within the past five
years, in violation of any provision of any Law applicable to the Companies or
the BSI Properties or the Companies business, properties or assets,
including, without limitation, those relating to antitrust or other
anticompetitive practices and to employment practices (such as discrimination,
health and safety). The Companies and, except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13_
, BSI (with respect to the BSI Properties) have (i) all franchises, licenses,

Property, including the BSI Properties, all of which Permits are set forth on
_Schedule 3.13_ and (ii) satisfied all material bonding requirements
pertaining to its operations under applicable Law. The Companies will

applicable Law and assigned to Alleyton without violation thereof or loss of
benefits thereunder and without consent of or notice to any third party,
including any Governmental Authority, except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13_.
Neither the Companies nor BSI (with respect to the BSI Properties) is in
violation of, nor is there a basis for the revocation or withdrawal of, any
Permit. The Companies and BSI (with respect to the BSI Properties) have
performed all obligations expressly set forth in writing in each Permit that
by their terms are to be performed on or before the Closing Date. No present
or, to the knowledge of the Seller Parties, pending federal, state or local

exception or based upon any zoning variance.

 

SECTION 3.14 _Litigation_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.14_ , there is
no Proceeding or Order pending or, to the knowledge of the Seller Parties or
BSI, threatened, against or affecting the Companies, BSI (with respect to the
BSI Properties), the BSI Properties or the assets or business prospects of the
Companies, or relating to or involving the Transactions at law or in equity,

Companies business (or similarly enjoining the Companies employees) or (ii)

memorandum or legal advice or notice from legal counsel to the effect that it
is exposed, from a legal standpoint, to any liability or disadvantage that
may be material to its assets, properties, business or business prospects.
There has not been within the last ten (10) years any Proceeding against or

notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a breach or default.
Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.15(b)_ , the execution and delivery of this

knowledge that the IRS has proposed any such adjustment or change in
accounting method, and there is no application pending with any taxing
authority requesting permission for any changes in accounting methods that
relate to the business or assets of the Companies.

SECTION 5.4 _Notice of Default of the Seller Parties_.

any event known to any of them, or the failure of any event to occur known to
any of them, that results in a breach of any representation or warranty by any
of them, or a failure by any of them, to comply with any covenant, condition
or agreement contained herein.

(b) The Sellers will take all actions necessary to render accurate as of the
Closing Date their respective representations and warranties contained herein,
(ii) refrain from taking any action that would render any such representation
or warranty inaccurate as of such time and (iii) perform or cause to be
satisfied each covenant or condition to be performed or satisfied by them as
contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 5.5 _Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation_.

(a) In order that Acquiror may have and enjoy the full benefit of the
Business and in consideration of, among other things, the consideration
provided by Acquiror pursuant to this Agreement and the entry into the
Ancillary Agreements, during the period from the date hereof through the
seventh anniversary of the date hereof (the " _Non-Compete Period_ "), no
Seller Party will:

(i) directly or indirectly, engage or invest in, own, manage, operate,
finance, control or participate in the ownership, management, operation,
financing, or control of, be employed by, associated with, or in any manner
connected with, lend any credit to, or render services or advice to or consult
with, any Person, business, firm, corporation, partnership, association, joint
venture or other entity or individual that engages in or conducts
any business engaged in by the Companies or BSI as of the Closing Date,
including the Business, anywhere within 150 miles from any of the operating
facilities of the Companies or the BSI Properties; _provided_ , _however_ ,
the Seller Parties may collectively own less than 1% of the outstanding
shares of any class of securities of any enterprise that conducts such
business (but without otherwise participating in the activities of such
enterprise) if such securities are listed on any national or regional
securities exchange or have been registered under Section 12(g) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;

(ii) except as set forth in _Schedule 5.5_ , directly or indirectly, either
for himself, herself, itself or any other Person or entity, hire any of the
officers or directors or other persons employed by the Companies, or Acquiror
or its affiliates (with respect to the Business) and their respective
successors or assigns, or solicit or induce such persons to leave the employ
of the Companies or Acquiror or its affiliates (with respect to
the Business);

(iii) directly or indirectly, approach or seek business from any Customer (as
defined below), refer business from any Customer to any enterprise or
business or be paid commissions based on business sales received from any
Customer by any enterprise or business. For purposes of this _Section 5.5_,
the term " _Customer_ " means any Person, firm, corporation, partnership,
association or other entity to which the Companies, Acquiror or their
affiliates or any of their successors or assigns, provided goods or services
during the 36-month period prior to the time at which any determination shall
be made that any

 



31  such Person, firm, corporation, partnership, association or other entity is
a Customer. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _affiliate_ " shall
mean any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the
named party;

(iv) disparage the Companies, Acquiror or any of their affiliates in any way
which could adversely affect the goodwill, reputation or business
relationships of the foregoing with the public generally, or with any of their

Person or entity, acquire, or negotiate and/or enter into a lease, royalty
arrangement or similar agreement related to the development or exploitation of
aggregate reserves or otherwise, relating to, the Trust Property, or render
services or advice to or consult with any other Person in connection
therewith. 

(b) Each of the Seller Parties acknowledges that the restrictions imposed by
this Agreement are fully understood by such Person, are fair and reasonable,
and will not preclude such Person from becoming gainfully employed following
the execution of this Agreement. Each Seller Party further acknowledges and
agrees that the payments to be made to it pursuant to this Agreement are
sufficient consideration for its obligations under _Section 5.5(a)_.

(c) If any of the provisions of this _Section 5.5_ shall otherwise
contravene or be invalid under the Laws of any state or other jurisdiction
where it is applicable but for such contravention or invalidity, such
contravention or invalidity shall not invalidate all of the provisions of
this _Section 5.5_, but rather this _Section 5.5_ shall be reformed and
construed, insofar as the Laws of that state or jurisdiction are concerned, as
not containing the provision or provisions, but only to the extent that they
are contravening or are invalid under the Laws of that state or jurisdiction,
and the rights and obligations created hereby shall be reformed and construed
and enforced accordingly. In the event of a breach or violation by any Seller
Party of this _Section 5.5_, Acquiror shall have the right to pursue all
legal remedies provided for herein and, notwithstanding recovery of any such
remedy, the Non-Compete Period as to such Seller Party shall be tolled until
such breach or violation has been cured.

(d) Each Seller Party acknowledges that Acquiror will have no adequate remedy
at law and may suffer irreparable damage if any of the Seller Parties breach
or fail to perform any of their obligations in this Agreement, including,
without limitation, _Section 5.5_, _Section 5.6_, _Section 5.8_ and 
_Section 5.13(b)_. Accordingly, each of the Seller Parties agrees that
Acquiror shall have the right, in addition to any other rights which it may
have, to specific performance and equitable injunctive relief if any of the
Seller Parties shall fail or threaten to fail to perform any of their
obligations hereunder. In connection therewith, each of the Seller Parties
waive the claim or defense that adequate remedy at law exists.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that, other than as
set forth in _Section 5.5(a)(v)_, this  _Section 5.5_ does not restrict or
prohibit the Seller Parties from owning, leasing or using real property for
purposes other than in connection with a Business or related activities
engaged in by the Companies prior to the Closing Date. The parties hereto
also agree that this Section 5.5 does not restrict Perry Glen Shepards
ability to engage or invest in, own, manage, operate, finance or control the
factoring business that he owns as of the date of this Agreement. 

SECTION 5.6 _Confidentiality_.

(a) Until the Closing Date, each of the parties shall, and shall cause its
affiliates and officers, directors, principals, employees, advisors, auditors,
agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to,
keep confidential, disclose only to its

 



32  affiliates or Representatives and use only in connection with the
Transactions all information and data obtained by them from the other party or
its affiliates or Representatives relating to such other party, the
Companies, the BSI Properties or the Transactions (other than information or
data that is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of a
breach of this _Section 5.6_ or that was known to such party at the time of
receipt), unless disclosure of such information or data is required by
applicable Law. In the event that the Transactions are not consummated, each
party shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
affiliates and Representatives to, promptly return to the other party or
destroy all documents (including all copies thereof) containing any such
information or data.

(b) For a period of seven years following the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
not, and each Seller shall cause its affiliates and Representatives and its
respective affiliates not to, use for its or their own benefit or divulge or
convey to any third party, any Confidential Information; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that each Seller and their respective affiliates may furnish such
portion (and only such portion) of the Confidential Information as such party
reasonably determines it is legally obligated to disclose if: (i) it receives
a request to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information under
the terms of a subpoena, civil investigative demand or Order issued by
a Governmental Authority; (ii) to the extent not inconsistent with such
request, it notifies Acquiror of the existence, terms and circumstances
surrounding such request and consults with Acquiror on the advisability of
taking steps available under applicable Law to resist or narrow such request;
(iii) it exercises its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an Order or
other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the
disclosed Confidential Information; and (iv) disclosure of such Confidential
Information is required to prevent the Seller Parties or such affiliate from
being held in contempt or becoming subject to any other penalty under
applicable Law. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Confidential Information_
" consists of this Agreement, all information and data relating to the
Companies, the assets and business of the Companies and the BSI Properties
(including intellectual property, customer and supplier lists, pricing
information, marketing plans, market studies, client development plans,
business acquisition plans and all other information or data), and the
Transactions, except for data or information that is or becomes available to
the public other than as a result of a breach of this _Section 5.6_.

(c) Effective as of the Closing, the Sellers hereby assign to Acquiror all
their respective right, title and interest in and to any confidentiality
agreements entered into by them and each Person (other than Acquiror and its
affiliates and Representatives) who entered into any such agreement or
to whom Confidential Information was provided in connection with any
transaction involving the acquisition or purchase of all or any portion of the
Companies or any of the Companies assets or the BSI Properties Interests.
From and after the Closing, the Sellers will take all actions reasonably
requested by Acquiror in order to assist in enforcing the rights so assigned.
The Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such
Person to return to the Sellers any documents, files, data or other materials
constituting Confidential Information that was provided to such Person in
connection with the consideration of any such transaction.

SECTION 5.7 _Public Announcements_. On and after the date hereof and through
the Closing Date, the parties shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions, and none of the
Seller Parties or TBGSI on the one hand or Acquiror on the other hand shall
issue any press release or make any public statement prior to obtaining the
other partys written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, except that no such approval shall be necessary to the extent
disclosure may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement of
any party hereto or its affiliates.

 



33 SECTION 5.8 _Exclusivity_.

 

(a) The Companies, TBGSI and the Sellers agree that between the date of this
Agreement and the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this
Agreement, the Companies, TBGSI and the Sellers shall not and shall not permit

offer, or any inquiry or other contact with any Person with respect thereto,
is made. Any such notice to Acquiror shall indicate in reasonable detail the
identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other
contact and the terms and conditions of such proposal, offer, inquiry or
other contact. The Companies, TBGSI and the Sellers shall not release any
Person from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which the Companies, TBGSI or a Seller is a party or
beneficiary, without the prior written consent of Acquiror.

SECTION 5.9 _Financing_.

than 45 days after the end of the relevant fiscal quarter in respect of

counsel to render and provide reasonable assistance to Acquiror and Acquirors
counsel in connection with the rendering of any legal opinions as may be
reasonably necessary in connection with the financing, in each case in

transaction such as the financing.

 

SECTION 5.10 _Notice of Default of Acquiror_.

(a) Acquiror will promptly give notice to the Seller Representative of the
occurrence of any event known to Acquiror, or the failure of any event known
to Acquiror to occur, that results in a breach of any representation or
warranty by Acquiror or a failure by Acquiror to comply with any covenant,
condition or agreement contained herein.

Closing Date its representations and warranties contained herein, (ii) refrain
from taking any action that would render any such representation or warranty
inaccurate as of such time and (iii) perform or cause to be satisfied each

SECTION 5.11 _Title Documents_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Companies, TBGSI and the Seller Parties will at
their cost and expense (other than the cost of premiums for additional title
and leasehold insurance that Acquiror requests that they obtain at Acquirors
cost) (i) use their good faith efforts to obtain estoppels, warranty deeds,
good and marketable title, title reports, title and leasehold insurance (in
form and substance satisfactory to Acquiror), correct defects and
imperfections of title and remove Encumbrances, other than Permitted
Encumbrances (which term does not include any amendments or supplements to the
Schedules for the purposes of this _Section 5.11_), for each of the parcels
of Real Property (including parcels that the Companies purport to own but may
not be titled in their name as of the date hereof ), and (ii) use their good
faith efforts to take such steps as otherwise may be necessary to ensure that
the Representations and Warranties of the Sellers and TBGSI set forth in
_Section 3.7_ hereof are true and correct as of the Closing Date. If the
Companies and Seller Parties fail to perform their obligations under this 
_Section 5.11_, Acquiror shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its
discretion, prior to the Closing, to satisfy these obligations and charge
Seller Parties for the cost relating thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the parties agree that matters relating to title to each of the parcels of
Real Property set forth on _Schedule 3.7(c)_ as owned by Alcomat
(collectively, the " _Alcomat Properties_ ") are addressed in  _Section
5.11(b)_, and not this _Section 5.11(a)_.

(b) Prior to Closing, Alleyton will, at its cost and expense, obtain, or
cause Alcomat to obtain, a title insurance policy for each Alcomat Property
with a value to be agreed on by Acquiror and the Alleyton Sellers
(collectively, the " _Alcomat Title Insurance Policies_ "). The Alleyton
Sellers will provide the title commitment for each Alcomat Title Insurance
Policy to Acquiror for review, and Acquiror will notify the Alleyton Sellers
of any Encumbrances set forth thereon to which Acquiror objects (collectively,
the " _Alcomat Title Objections_ "). The Alleyton Sellers will use their good
faith efforts to remove the Alcomat Title Objections from the Alcomat Title
Insurance Policies prior to Closing.

 



35 (c) Prior to Closing, Alleyton will, at its cost and expense, obtain a title
insurance policy for the Owens Property with a value equal to the purchase
price of the Owens Property set forth in the Owens Purchase Agreement (the "
_Owens Title Insurance Policy_ "). Prior to Closing, Acquiror will notify the
Alleyton Sellers of any Encumbrances set forth on the title insurance
commitment for the Owens Property to which Acquiror objects (collectively, the
" _Owens Objections_ "). The Alleyton Sellers will use their reasonable best
efforts to remove the Owens Title Objections from the title insurance policy
for the Owens Property prior to Closing. Prior to Closing, Alleyton will
deliver to Acquiror a true and complete copy of the survey of the Owens
Property. Acquiror will notify the Alleyton Sellers of any discrepancies in
the survey of the Owens Property to which Acquiror objects. The Alleyton
Sellers will use their good faith efforts to correct such discrepancies prior
to Closing.

 

(d) Provided that they have used their good faith efforts, the Companies,
TBGSI and the Seller Parties shall not have any liability to Acquiror for the
termination of this Agreement related to the failure to satisfy the goals of
those efforts as set forth in this _Section 5.11_.

SECTION 5.12 _Financial Reporting_. Prior to and after the Closing, the Seller
Parties shall and shall cause their affiliates and Representatives to
cooperate with Acquiror in connection with, and use reasonable best efforts
to provide to Acquiror any information (including annual, quarterly, monthly
and other financial statements and information related to the Companies and
their businesses and operations and the BSI Properties) reasonably requested
by Acquiror in connection with, in compliance with any reasonable deadline
imposed by Acquiror, Acquirors or any of its affiliates compliance with any
Law or GAAP requirement applicable to it.

 

SECTION 5.13 _Trust Property_. From the date hereof through the Closing Date,
the Major Sellers will each use their respective good faith efforts to
negotiate and assist Alleyton in its efforts to enter into an agreement with
RES/VLS Real Estate Limited Partnership (or its assignee) for the lease, on
commercially reasonable terms, of that certain piece of real property known
as the Trust Property as more fully described on _Schedule 5.13(a)_ hereto
(the " _Trust Property_ "); _provided, however_ , that neither Alleyton nor
any Seller Party shall enter into any lease or acquisition agreement relating
to the Trust Property without the prior written consent of Acquiror. Provided
that the Seller Parties have used good faith efforts to comply with their
obligations under this _Section 5.13(a)_: none of the Seller Parties shall
have any liability to Acquiror if Alleyton does not enter into a lease for the
Trust Property as contemplated by this _Section 5.13(a)_, and the
consideration to be paid under this Agreement at or after Closing shall not
be adjusted because Alleyton has not entered into such lease.

SECTION 5.14 _Waiver of Buy-Sell Agreements_. Each Company and Equity Seller
that is a party to the Buy-Sell Agreement, dated as of January 1, 2013, among
Todd Barten, Perry Glen Shepard, Frank Bantle, Sr., Steve Rhodes, Johnny Cook
and Alleyton or to the Buy-Sell Agreement, dated as of January 1, 2013, among
Todd Barten, Perry Glen Shepard, Steve Rhodes, Johnny Cook, Colorado and CGC
(together, the " _Buy-Sell Agreements_ ") hereby waives any rights exercisable
by such Company or Equity Seller pursuant to the Buy-Sell Agreements in
connection with the Transactions.

SECTION 5.15 _Colorado County Aggregates Reserves_. During the Non-Compete
Period, upon Acquirors request from time to time, the Major Sellers will use
their respective good faith efforts to assist Acquiror with any opportunities
that may arise to acquire or "lease" aggregates in Colorado County, Texas
(any agreements for such acquisitions or leases, the " _Colorado County
Aggregates Reserves Agreements_ "). In addition, if either of the Major
Sellers, directly or indirectly, either for himself or any

 



36  other Person, has the opportunity to negotiate and/or enter into a Colorado
County Aggregates Reserves Agreement, whether or not such opportunity arose
out of a request by Acquiror, the Major Sellers will notify Acquiror of such
opportunity and provide it with the details thereof. The Acquirors rights and
Major Sellers obligations hereunder are in addition to the rights and
obligations set forth in the Noncompete provisions of _Section 5.5_ hereof
and the provisions of _Section 5.13_ hereof regarding the Trust Lease.

 

SECTION 5.16 _Schedule Amendments_. The Sellers and TBGSI shall (and are
hereby permitted to) supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules so that
such schedules and related representations and warranties are true and correct
as soon as possible after the date hereof and in no case later than such date
(the " _Cut-Off Date_ ") as is necessary to allow sufficient time prior to
the Termination Date for financing of the Transactions contemplated by
Acquiror to be secured on the basis of the final Disclosure Schedules. No such
supplements or amendments to any Disclosure Schedules shall be made, nor
shall be effective even if purported to be made, on or after the Cut-Off Date.
The exact date to be established for the Cut-Off Date shall be agreed by the
parties hereto as soon as possible after the date hereof, subject to the
mutual reasonable consent of the parties hereto based on the time reasonably
required for the Sellers and TBGSI to complete the Disclosure Schedules while
allowing sufficient time prior to the Termination Date to allow the Acquiror
to secure the financing contemplated by Acquiror to fund the Transactions
which the parties recognize requires finalized Disclosure Schedule. The
Sellers and TBGSI shall have no liability under this Agreement whether or not
the Closing occurs for any misrepresentations made as of the date hereof that
are corrected by such supplements or amendments to such Disclosure Schedules
prior to the Cut-Off Date. The parties agree that the Closing Share
percentages set forth on _Schedule 2.9(c)(i)_ may be amended prior to Closing
by the Seller Representative, once the Estimated Purchase Price has been
determined.

SECTION 5.17 _Vox Property Development_. The Companies and BSI shall continue
to develop the Vox Property in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice.

SECTION 5.18 _Brune Lease and Adjacent Property_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Alleyton may transfer and assign to BSI the Brune
Lease, which relates to that certain piece of real property known as the Brune
Property as more fully described on _Schedule 5.18(a)_ hereto (the "
_Brune Property_ "). The parties hereto agree that the use of the Brune
Property and the Adjacent Property following the Closing is subject to
_Section 5.5_. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers will (i) permit Acquiror and
its Representatives to access the Brune Property and the Adjacent Property in
order to test such property, including by performing intrusive studies, for
the presence of aggregates and (ii) otherwise facilitate such testing.

 

(b) For the purposes of this Section 5.18:

(i) The " _Adjacent Property_ " means that certain piece of real property
adjacent to the Brune Property as more fully described on _Schedule 5.18(b)_
hereto.

 

(ii) The " _Brune Lease_ " means the Sand and Gravel Lease, dated August 14,
2008, between Marjorie S. Brune, individually and as trustee of the Marjorie

38 SECTION 6.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Threshold_. Except as provided in _Section 6.3(c)_, no Indemnified Party
shall be permitted to enforce any claim for indemnification pursuant to this
Agreement based on _Sections 6.1(a)_ or _6.2(a)_ , respectively against any
Indemnifying Party until in each case the aggregate amount of such respective
claims exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Threshold Amount_ "). Once claims pursuant
to such respective _Sections 6.1(a)_ or _6.2(a)_ , as the case may be, in
excess of the Threshold Amount have been asserted by such Indemnified Party
against such Indemnifying Parties in the aggregate, all such claims may be
pursued, but only to the extent that such claims are above the Threshold
Amount.

(b)  _Maximum Indemnification_. Except as provided in _Section 6.3(c)_, in
no event shall any Indemnifying Party be required to make indemnification
payments with respect to claims based on _Sections 6.1(a)_ or _6.2(a)_
, respectively, in excess of $15,000,000.

(c) _Limitation_. The limitations in _Sections 6.3(a)_ and _6.3(b)_  shall
not apply to any Fundamental Claim, Fraud Claim or Tax Claim, as defined
herein. In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be required to make
indemnification payments under this Agreement in excess of the Total Purchase
Price.

 

(d) _Survival_. Any claim for indemnification shall survive the Closing until
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations, if any, subject to the
survival periods, if any, set forth in this _Section 6.3_ with respect to
certain of such claims; _provided, however_ , that any claim for
indemnification based upon any misrepresentation with respect to
_Sections 3.1_ , _3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.4_ , _3.5_ , _3.7(c)_ , and _3.24_ ("
_Fundamental Claim_ ") shall survive indefinitely. In addition, any claim for
indemnification shall survive the applicable termination date, if any, set
forth herein if a party, prior to such termination date, shall have advised
the other party in writing of facts that constitute or may give rise to an
alleged claim for indemnification, specifying in reasonable detail the
basis under this Agreement for such claim.

(i) _Representations and Warranties_. Any claim for indemnification based on 
_Section 6.1(a)_ or _Section 6.2(a)_ other than a claim referred to in
_Sections 6.3(d)(ii)_ or _6.3(d)(iii)_ shall be made during the period from
the Closing Date until the date that is eighteen months after the Closing
Date, after which such date, the Indemnified Parties are foreclosed from
making such claims against the Indemnifying Parties.

(ii) _Environmental Claims_. Any claim based upon _Section 6.1(d)_, or the
breach by the Seller Parties of the representations and warranties set forth
in _Section 3.10_ (" _Environmental Claims_ ") may be made at any time prior
to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, after which such date, the
Indemnified Parties are foreclosed from making such claims against the
Indemnifying Parties 

(iii) _Claims Barred Only by the Applicable Statute of Limitations_. Any claim
based upon (A) any willful, grossly negligent, fraudulent or intentional
misrepresentation of any Seller contained in this Agreement, any Ancillary
Agreement or any other document, list, exhibit or instrument furnished in
connection herewith or therewith, including any assessment by a taxing
authority alleged to arise from a willful, false or fraudulent intent to evade
taxes, or from any failure to file a return (" _Fraud Claim_ "); or (B) taxes
for which the Seller Indemnifying Parties are required to indemnify Acquiror
or from a misrepresentation of the Seller Parties with respect to _Section
3.17_ (" _Tax Claim_ "), may be made until the date that such claim is barred
by the applicable statute of limitations, if any.

(e) _Offset_. The Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall have the right to set off
and apply against any future payments owed to the Seller Indemnifying Parties
or any of their affiliates under _Section 2.7_ (Installment Payments), the
amount of any indemnity claims made in good faith by the Acquiror

 



39  Indemnified Parties against the Seller Indemnifying Parties pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. Any such set-off and
application may be made by an Acquiror Indemnified Party of the amount of any
such indemnity claims and such amounts shall, without further action on the
part of any party, be deemed set off and applied against any future
installment payments described in _Section 2.7_ as determined by the
Acquiror Indemnified Party. Subject to the following sentence, the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties may pursue recovery against the Seller Indemnifying
Parties from other than the installment payments described in  _Section 2.7_
to the extent that there are or may be insufficient installment payments (as
measured in the following sentence) to satisfy such claims. The parties agree
that any judgment or settlement of any indemnity claim made by the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties under this _Article VI_ shall be satisfied first by
offsetting the amount of such settlement or judgment against any future
payments owed to the Seller Indemnifying Parties or any of their affiliates
under  _Section 2.7_ (Installment Payments) in accordance with _Section
6.3(e)_; _provided_ , that the amount to be so offset with respect to any
settlement or judgment not due at the time such indemnity claim was made shall
be valued on a present value basis using a discount rate of ten percent.

SECTION 6.4 _Defense by the Indemnifying Parties_. In connection with any
claim giving rise to indemnity hereunder resulting from or arising out of any
claim or legal proceeding by a Person (other than the Indemnified Parties)
solely for monetary damages in a civil proceeding, the Indemnifying Parties
at their sole cost and expense, may, upon written notice to the Indemnified
Parties received by the Indemnified Parties within 10 Business Days after the
Indemnifying Parties receipt of notice of such claim, assume the defense of
any such claim or legal proceeding, _provided_ that the Indemnifying Parties
acknowledge in writing their obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Parties
in respect of the entire amount of all of the claims asserted therein,
subject to the indemnity limitations hereunder . If the Indemnifying Parties
assume the defense of any such claim or legal proceeding, the Indemnifying
Parties shall select counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Parties
to conduct the defense of such claims or legal proceedings and, at their sole
cost and expense (which costs and expenses shall not be applied against any
indemnity limitation hereunder), shall take all steps necessary in the defense
or settlement thereof. The Indemnifying Parties shall not consent to a
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim or
legal proceeding, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Parties, unless such settlement is solely for monetary damages and does not
involve the admission of wrongdoing by any of the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnifying Parties admit in writing their liability to hold the Indemnified
Parties harmless from and against any and all Losses arising out of such
settlement and concurrently with such settlement the Indemnifying Parties pay
into court the full amount of all Losses to be paid by the Indemnifying
Parties in connection with such settlement, subject to the indemnity
limitations hereunder. The Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
participate in (but not control) the defense of any such action, with their
own counsel and at their own expense and shall be entitled to any and all
information or documentation relating thereto; _provided_ , that, if upon the
advice of counsel, there shall exist a potential conflict of interest between
the Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying Parties or one or more defenses
may be available to the Indemnified Parties that are not available to
the Indemnifying Parties, then, in each such case, the Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to participate in such defense with their own counsel at the
expense of the Indemnifying Parties. If the Indemnifying Parties do not assume
(or continue to diligently and competently prosecute) the defense of any such
claim or litigation resulting therefrom in accordance with the terms hereof
the Indemnified Parties may defend against such claim or litigation in such
manner as they may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling
such claim or litigation, subject to the consent of the Indemnifying Parties
(not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Indemnifying
Parties shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any action by the
Indemnified Parties, which participation shall be limited to contributing
information to the defense and being advised of its status.

SECTION 6.5 _Manner of Indemnification_. Within 30 calendar days after receipt
of notice by the Indemnifying Parties of a claim by the Indemnified Parties,
subject to the last sentence of  _Section 6.3(e)_, the Indemnifying Parties
shall satisfy such claim by the payment of cash to the Indemnified Parties for
the full amount of such claim unless the Indemnifying Parties deliver notice
that they dispute such claim or part thereof within such period.

 



40 SECTION 6.6 _Intentionally Omitted_.

 

SECTION 6.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. The Indemnified Parties agree that
indemnification under this _Article VI_ shall be the exclusive remedy against
any Indemnifying Party for any breaches of any representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the parties under this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and in any certificate delivered hereunder or thereunder, except
with respect to Fraud Claims or claims seeking equitable remedies.

SECTION 6.8 _Accounts Receivable_. 

(a) The Seller Indemnifying Parties shall reimburse the Acquiror Indemnified
Parties the amount by which the sum of all accounts receivable of the
Companies reflected in the calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital
(the " _Closing Date Receivables_ ") exceeds the sum of the amounts collected
by the Companies in satisfaction of such Closing Date Receivables by the
later of the due date or 180 days after the Closing Date. Amounts paid "on
account" and not designated by the payor to be paid in satisfaction of
specific invoices or clearly identifiable to specific invoices shall be
presumed to have been paid in satisfaction of the payors oldest obligation to
the Companies and shall be so applied on the books of the Companies.

(b) Upon payment to the Acquiror Indemnified Parties by the Seller
Indemnifying Parties for any uncollected Closing Date Receivables pursuant to
the terms hereof, Acquiror or its affiliates, as the case may be, shall
assign to the Seller Indemnifying Parties all of Acquirors right, title and
interest in and to such Closing Date Receivables.

SECTION 6.9 _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Tax Returns_. The Seller Parties shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all tax returns of the
Companies, Alcomat, Allied Concrete and any of their Subsidiaries for all
periods ending on or before the Closing Date. Acquiror shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and shall timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all
tax returns of the Companies, Alcomat, Allied Concrete and any of their
Subsidiaries for all periods ending after the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Sellers  Obligations_. The Seller Indemnifying Parties shall be
responsible for and pay and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties with respect to (i) any and all taxes imposed on the
Companies, Alcomat, Allied Concrete and any of their Subsidiaries or for which
the Companies, Alcomat, Allied Concrete and any of their Subsidiaries are
liable with respect to any periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
including to the extent apportioned to such period pursuant to _Section
6.9(d),_ and (ii) any costs or expenses with respect to taxes indemnified
hereunder. Any indemnity required to be made by the Seller Indemnifying
Parties pursuant to this _Section 6.9(b)_ shall be made within 30 days after
the Sellers receipt of written notice from Acquiror.

 

(c) _Acquiror s Obligations_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
6.9(b)_, from and after the Closing Date, Acquiror and the Companies shall be
solely responsible for the payment or discharge of all taxes imposed on the
Companies, Alcomat, Allied Concrete and any of their Subsidiaries for (i) all
periods ending after the Closing Date and (ii) any costs or expenses with
respect to taxes indemnified hereunder. Acquiror shall indemnify, defend and
hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from any and all taxes that are
Acquirors responsibility pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. Any
indemnity payment required to be made by Acquiror pursuant to this _Section
6.9(c)_ shall be made within 30 days after Acquirors receipt of written
notice from the Sellers.

 



41 (d) _Apportionment_. For the sole purpose of appropriately apportioning any
taxes relating to a period that includes (but that would not end on) the
Closing Date, Acquiror will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, elect
with the relevant taxing authority to treat for all purposes the Closing Date
as the last day of a taxable period of the Companies, Alcomat, Allied
Concrete and any of their Subsidiaries. In the case where applicable Law does
not permit the Companies, Alcomat, Allied Concrete and any of their
Subsidiaries to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period,
then for purposes of this Agreement, the portion of such tax that is
attributable to the Companies, Alcomat, Allied Concrete and any of their
Subsidiaries for the part of such taxable period that ends on the Closing Date
shall be (i) in the case of a tax that is not transaction-based, the total
amount of such tax for the full taxable period that includes the Closing Date
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from
the beginning of such taxable period to and including the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the total number of days in such full taxable
period, and (ii) in the case of transaction-based taxes, including any based
on net income, the tax that would be due with respect to such partial period,
if such partial period were a full taxable period, apportioning income, gain,
expenses, loss, depreciation, deductions and credits equitably based on an
interim closing of the books.

 

(e) _Contests_. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Contest_ " is any audit,
court proceeding or other dispute with respect to any tax matter that affects
the Companies, Alcomat, Allied Concrete and any of their Subsidiaries. Unless
Acquiror has previously received written notice from the Sellers of the
existence of such Contest, Acquiror shall give written notice to the Sellers
of the existence of any Contest relating to a tax matter that is the
responsibility of the Seller Indemnifying Parties under _Section 6.9(b)_
within ten days from the receipt by Acquiror of any written notice of
such Contest, but no failure to give such notice shall relieve the Seller
Indemnifying Parties of any liability hereunder, except to the extent that the
Seller Indemnifying Parties are prejudiced by such failure to give timely
notice. Unless the Sellers have previously received written notice from
Acquiror of the existence of such Contest, the Sellers shall give written
notice to Acquiror of the existence of any Contest for which Acquiror has
responsibility within ten days from the receipt by the Sellers of any written
notice of such Contest. Acquiror, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand, agree, in each case at no cost to the other party, to cooperate
with the other and the others representatives in a prompt and timely manner
in connection with any Contest. Such cooperation shall include, but not be
limited to, making available to the other party, during normal business hours,
all books, records, returns, documents, files, other information (including,
without limitation working papers and schedules), officers or employees
(without substantial interruption of employment) or other relevant information
necessary or useful in connection with any Contest requiring any such books,
records and files. The Sellers shall, at their election, have the right to
represent each of the Companys interests in any Contest relating to a tax
matter arising in a period ending on or before the Closing Date, to employ
counsel of their choice at their expense and to control the conduct of such
Contest, including settlement or other disposition thereof; _provided,
however,_ that Acquiror shall have the right to consult with the Sellers
regarding any such Contest that may affect either of the Companies , Alcomat,
Allied Concrete and any of their Subsidiaries or taxes relating to the BSI
Properties for any periods ending after the Closing Date at Acquirors own
expense and _provided_ , _further_ , that any settlement or other disposition
of any such Contest may only be with the consent of Acquiror, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Acquiror shall have
the right to control the conduct of any Contest with respect to any tax
matter arising in a period ending after the Closing Date.

(f) _Controlling Provisions_. In the event of any conflict between
the provisions of this _Section 6.9_ and any other provisions of this
_Article VI_ , this _Section 6.9_ shall be controlling with respect to any
claim for indemnification for taxes.

 



42 (g) _Transfer Taxes_. All city and county documentary, stamp or other transfer
taxes relating to real property resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall be borne and paid equally by the Seller Parties on the
one hand and Acquiror on the other hand.

 

(h) _BSI Properties Tax Apportionment_. Any real property taxes imposed with
respect to the BSI Properties for the taxable period that includes the
Closing Date shall be borne by BSI and Acquiror (or its affiliates, including
Alleyton), respectively, based on the proportionate number of days during such
period that the BSI Properties were owned by BSI (which shall include
the Closing Date), on the one hand, and Acquiror (or its affiliates,
including Alleyton), on the other hand.

(i) _BSI Properties Roll Back Tax Obligations_. To the extent that real
property taxes are owed with respect to the BSI Properties for any taxable
period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date solely as a
result of Acquiror or its Affiliates changing the use of the BSI Properties
after the Closing Date such that the BSI Properties fail to qualify for the
"open space" or "agricultural use" real property tax exemptions, such real
property taxes shall be borne and paid by Acquiror or its Affiliates.

TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR

the schedules, exhibits and other documents and agreements contemplated

SECTION 10.7 _Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any right, remedy,

expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person or entity other

assignees any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement unless
so stated herein to the contrary.

signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Seller Representative and
Acquiror, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is
sought. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as
a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or
condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The

more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of

parties. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile signature and a

deemed to be severable as to such jurisdiction (but, to the extent permitted
by Law, not elsewhere) and shall not affect the remainder of this Agreement,
which shall continue in full force and effect so long as either the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not materially
varied or is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or
such party waives its rights under this Section with respect thereto in
writing. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be so broad as to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
necessary for it to be enforceable.

 

SECTION 10.11 _Intentionally Omitted_.

SECTION 10.12 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person, entity,

dispute arises in the interpretation or construction of this Agreement, no
presumption shall arise that any party drafted this Agreement. Whenever a

Schedule such reference shall be to a Section, Article, Exhibit or Schedule
of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of
definitions and headings contained in this Agreement or in any Exhibit are for

will be construed to be of such gender or number as the circumstances require.
