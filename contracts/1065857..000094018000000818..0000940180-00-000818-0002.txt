with or as promptly as practicable after the Closing, a properly executed
certificate of merger conforming to the requirements of Section 251 of the

"Effective Time").   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors
and Officers. Unless otherwise determined by Parent and the Company prior to
the Effective Time:   (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform
to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time;   (b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to conform to the
Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time;
and   (c) the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the individuals

Conversion of Preferred Stock; Conversion of Shares.   (a) Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (i) the outstanding Convertible Notes shall be
exchanged for promissory notes of the Company in a form having the general
terms set forth in the Expression of Interest Letter and otherwise reasonably
acceptable to the Company, Parent and those Designated   2   Shareholders
that are holders of the Convertible Notes (the "Investor Notes"); and (ii)
the Investor Warrants will be exchanged for Company Common Stock.
The aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Investor Notes as of the
Effective Time shall be equal to or less than $5,000,000. Parent will reissue
the Investor Notes and join the Company as a payor of the Investor Notes
immediately following the Effective Time.   (b) Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, $.0001
par value, of the Company ("Series A Preferred Stock") shall be exchanged for
shares of Company Common Stock. The transactions described in subparagraphs
(a) and (b) are referred to herein, collectively, as the "Exchange and
Conversion Transactions."   (c) Subject to Section 1.8(c), at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any shareholder of the Company:   (i)
each share of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, of the Company
("Company Common Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive 0.2677308348112 of a share
("Applicable Fraction") of the common stock, par value $.001 per share,
of Parent ("Common Stock");   (ii) each share of the common stock (with no
par value) of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   (d) Parent acknowledges that the Exchange and Conversion
Transactions are conditioned upon the execution of the CA Shareholder
Indemnity and Escrow Agent.   1.6 Employee Stock Options. At the Effective
Time, each stock option to acquire Company Common Stock that is then
outstanding, including but not limited to those granted under each of (i) the
Company\'s 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (ii) the Company\'s 1998-1999 Stock
Option Plan and (iii) the Company\'s 1997-1999 Stock Option Plan (the
"Company Stock Option Plans"), whether vested or unvested (a "Company
Option"), shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with the terms (as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the applicable Company
Stock Option Plan and/or the stock option agreement by which such Company
Option is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under
outstanding Company Options shall thereupon be converted into rights with
respect to Common Stock as set forth below. Accordingly, from and after the
Effective Time, (a) each Company Option assumed by Parent may be exercised
solely for shares of Common Stock, (b) the number of shares of Common Stock
subject to each such assumed Company Option shall be equal to the number of
shares of Company   3   Common Stock that were subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Applicable
Fraction, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Common Stock,
(c) the per share exercise price for the Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of each such assumed Company Option shall be determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the
Applicable Fraction, and rounding the resulting exercise price up to the
nearest whole cent, and (d) all restrictions on the exercise of each such
assumed Company Option shall continue in full force and effect, and the term,
exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company Option
shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided, however, that each such assumed
Company Option shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further
adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction effected
by Parent after the Effective Time. The Company and Parent shall take all
action that may be necessary (under each of the Company Stock Option Plans
and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.6. Following
the Closing, Parent will send to each holder of an assumed Company Option a
written notice setting forth (i) the number of shares of Common Stock subject
to such assumed Company Option, and (ii) the exercise price per share of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option. Parent
shall file with the SEC, as soon as reasonably practical but in any event
within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, a registration statement on
Form S-8 registering the exercise of the Company Options assumed by Parent
pursuant to this Section 1.6.   1.7 Closing of the Company\'s Transfer
Books. At the Effective Time, holders of certificates representing shares of
the Company\'s capital stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company,
and the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to
all shares of such capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of the Company\'s
capital stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously
representing any of such shares of the Company\'s capital stock (a "Company
Stock Certificate") is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such
Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as
provided in Section 1.8.   1.8 Exchange of Certificates.   (a) At or as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will send to
the holders of Company Stock Certificates (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company
Stock Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Common  
4   Stock. Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to Parent for
exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other
documents as may be reasonably required by Parent the holder of such Company
Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (subject
to Section 8.3) a certificate representing the number of whole shares of
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 1, and the Company Stock Certificate so
surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.8, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender a certificate representing shares of Common Stock (and cash in lieu
of any fractional share of Common Stock as described in Section 1.8(c)) as
contemplated by this Section 1. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing Common
Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in
such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate.   (b) No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock
Certificate with respect to the shares of Common Stock represented thereby,
and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional share shall be paid to any such
holder, until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in
accordance with this Section 1.8 (at which time such holder shall be entitled
to receive all such dividends and distributions and such cash payment).  
(c) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued in connection with
the Merger, and no certificates for any such fractional shares shall be
issued. In lieu of such fractional shares, any holder of capital stock or
other securities of the Company who would otherwise be entitled to receive
a fraction of a share of Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, upon surrender of such
holder\'s Company Stock Certificate(s), be paid in cash the dollar amount
(rounded to the nearest whole cent), determined by multiplying such fraction
by the closing price of Parent\'s Common Stock on the trading day immediately
preceding the Closing Date.   (d) Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder or former holder of capital stock
of the Company for any shares of Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to any public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   5    1.9 Tax Consequences. For federal income tax purposes, the
Merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations. No party
shall take any position on any Tax Return inconsistent with this Section 1.9
unless advised in writing by such party\'s auditors that such a position is
required.   1.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation
or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such
action.  2. Representations and Warranties of the Company   The Company

Schedule identifies each salary, bonus, deferred compensation, incentive

(collectively, the "Plans") sponsored, maintained, contributed to or required
to be contributed to by the Company for the benefit of any current or former
employee or director of, or current or former consultant or contractor to,
the Company or its subsidiaries.   (b) Except as set forth in Part 2.16(b)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not, and nor do any of
its subsidiaries, maintain, sponsor or contribute to, and the Company has
not, and nor have any of its Subsidiaries, at any time in the past
maintained, sponsored or contributed to, any employee pension benefit plan
(as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), whether or not excluded from coverage under
specific Titles or Subtitles of ERISA) for the benefit of employees or former
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (a "Pension Plan"). None of the
Plans identified in Part 2.16(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.   (c) Except as set
forth in Part 2.16(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does
not, and nor do any of its Subsidiaries, maintain, sponsor or contribute to
any: (i) employee welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA,
whether or not excluded from coverage under specific Titles or Subtitles of
ERISA) for the benefit of any employee or former employee or director of, or
current or former consultant or contractor to, the Company and its
Subsidiaries (a "Welfare Plan"), or (ii) self-funded medical, dental or other
similar Plan. None of the Plans identified in Section 2.16(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule is a multi-employer plan (within the meaning of Section
3(37) of ERISA).   (d) With respect to each Plan, the Company has delivered
to Parent, on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries: (i) an accurate
and complete copy of such Plan (including all amendments thereto); (ii) an
accurate and complete copy of the annual report, if required under ERISA,

Summary of Material Modifications, if required under ERISA, with respect to
such Plan, (iv) if such Plan is funded through a trust or any third party
funding vehicle, an accurate and complete copy of the trust or other funding
agreement (including all amendments thereto) and accurate and  
25   complete copies the most recent financial statements thereof; (v)

received from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to such Plan (if such
Plan is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code) and any
governmental advisory opinions, rulings, compliance statements, closing
agreements, or similar materials specific to such Plan.   (e) The Company
is not and never, and none of its Subsidiaries is or ever, has been required
to be treated as a single employer with any other Person under Section
4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code. The
Company has never and none of its Subsidiaries has ever made a complete or
partial withdrawal from a multi-employer plan, as such term is defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA, resulting in "withdrawal liability," as such term is
defined in Section 4201 of ERISA (without regard to subsequent reduction or
waiver of such liability under either Section 4207 or 4208 of ERISA).   (f)
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any plan or commitment to
create any Welfare Plan or any additional Pension Plan, or to modify or
change any existing Pension Plan (other than to comply with applicable law,
including, without limitation, amendments to the Code and ERISA made by
the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994
("USERRA"), the Uruguay Round Agreement Act ("GATT"), the Small Business Job
Protection Act of 1996 ("SBJPA") and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 ("TRA
\'97")) in a manner that would affect any current or former employee or
director of, or current or former consultant or contractor to, of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has not and none of its Subsidiaries
has agreed in writing to maintain any Plan for any period of time and each
such Plan is terminable at the sole discretion of the sponsor thereof,
subject only to such constraints as may imposed by applicable law.   (g) No
Plan provides death, medical or health benefits (whether or not insured) with
respect to any current or former employee or director of, or current or
former consultant or contractor to, the Company or any Subsidiary after any
such individual\'s termination of service other than (i) benefit coverage
mandated by applicable law, including coverage provided pursuant to Section
4980B of the Code, (ii) deferred compensation benefits accrued as liabilities
on the Company Balance Sheet, and (iii) benefits the full cost of which are
borne by such individuals of the Company or any Subsidiary (or
their beneficiaries)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain individual
employees have such benefits under their employment agreements as disclosed
in Part 2.10(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   26    (h) With
respect to any Plan constituting a group health plan within the meaning of
Section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code, the provisions of Section 4980B of the Code
("COBRA") have been complied with in all material respects. Part 2.16(h) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule describes all obligations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement under any of the
provisions of COBRA.   (i) Each of the Plans has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. There is no
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened legal action,
proceeding or investigation, other than routine claims for benefits,
concerning any Plan or to the best knowledge of the Company any fiduciary or
service provider thereof with respect to the Plans and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, there is no basis for any such legal action or proceeding. No
Plan nor any party in interest with respect thereof has engaged in a
prohibited transaction which could subject the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly to liability under Section 409 or
502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. With respect to each Plan for
which a separate fund of assets is or is required to be maintained, full
payment has been made of all amounts required of the Company, under the terms
of each such Plan or applicable law, as applied through the Closing Date.  
(j) Each of the Plans intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has either received a favorable determination from the Internal Revenue
Service as to its qualified status under the Code (or relies on a favorable
opinion letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to a
standardized form of prototype plan adopted by the Company or
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be) or the requisite period under
applicable Treasury Regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in
which to apply for such determination letter and to make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination with respect to the Plan has
not expired, and the Company is not aware of any reason why any such
determination letter should be revoked or which requires or could require
action under the compliance resolution programs of the Internal Revenue
Service to preserve such qualification.   (k) Except as set forth in Part
2.16(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution, delivery
or performance of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, alone or in
combination with any other event or action, will result in any payment
(including any bonus, golden parachute or severance payment) to any current
or former employee or director of, or current or former consultant or
contractor to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not under
any Plan), or materially increase the benefits payable under any Plan, or
result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
such benefits (other than as   27   required under Section 411(d)(3) of
the Code in connection with the termination or partial termination of a
Plan).   (l) Part 2.16(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
list of all salaried employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
date of this Agreement, and correctly reflects, in all material respects,
their base salaries, their targeted annual bonus amounts, their dates of
employment and their positions. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining contract or other
Contract with a labor union involving any of its employees. Except as set

employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are "at will" employees and
each current or former contractor or consultant to the Company and its
Subsidiaries is and has at all times been properly characterized as such.  
(m) Part 2.16(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each employee
who is not fully available to perform work because of disability or other
leave and sets forth the basis of such leave and the anticipated date
of return to full service.   (n) Each Plan complies in all material
respects with all applicable Legal Requirements. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with all Contracts
relating to employment, employment practices, wages, bonuses and terms and
conditions of employment, including employee compensation matters.   (o)
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good labor relations, and the
Company does not have any Knowledge that (i) the consummation of the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will have a
material adverse effect on the labor relations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (ii) any of the employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries intends to terminate his or her employment with the Company
or its Subsidiary, as the case may be.   2.17 Environmental Matters. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Environmental Laws, which compliance includes

Governmental Authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws, and
compliance with the terms and conditions thereof. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no pending or threatened civil or criminal litigation,
written notice of violation, formal administrative proceeding,
or investigation inquiry or information request by an Governmental Body,
relating to any Environmental Law involving the Company or its Subsidiaries.
The Company has not received any notice or other communication (in writing or
otherwise), whether from a Governmental Body, citizens group, employee or
otherwise, that alleges that the Company or its Subsidiaries is not in
compliance with any   28   Environmental Law. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no current or prior owner of any property leased or controlled by
the Company has received any notice or other communication (in writing or
otherwise), whether from a Government Body, citizens group, employee or
otherwise, that alleges that such current or prior owner or the Company is
not in compliance with any Environmental Law. To the Knowledge of the
Company, all property that is leased to, controlled by or used by the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and all surface water, groundwater and soil associated
with or adjacent to such property is in clean and healthful condition and is
free of any material environmental contamination of any nature.   2.18

policies and fidelity bonds covering the assets, business,
equipment, properties, operations, software, errors and omissions, employees,
officers and directors of the Company, as well as all claims made under any

premiums payable under all such policies and bonds have been paid and the
Company is otherwise in compliance in all material respects with the terms of
such policies and bonds. Such policies of insurance and bonds are of the type

directly or indirectly give rise to or serve as a basis for any
such claim.   2.19 Related Party Transactions. Except as set forth in Part

management agreement (the "Management Agreement") governing the terms of the
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries during the period between the
HSR Termination Date and the earlier of the Closing Date and the date of
termination of this Agreement. The Management Agreement will provide (w) that
Parent will only operate the Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of business, and will make the same undertakings to the Company with
respect to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as the Company
has made in this Section 5.1, (x) that Parent will indemnify the Company for
any breach of the covenants contained in the Management Agreement, (y) that
the Company will cooperate with Parent in the operation of the business, and
(z) that Parent shall get the benefit of all revenues of the Company and its
Subsidiaries during this period and will be responsible for the expenses of
the Company and its Subsidiaries during this period. The terms of the
Management Agreement will be negotiated in good faith by Parent and the
Company and will be entered into effective as of the HSR Termination
Date.   5.2 Registration Statement. On the Closing Date, Parent will enter
into a Registration Rights Agreement (which upon execution thereof will
supercede this Section 5.2 in its entirety) with the Designated Shareholders
and Other Shareholders that will include the following rights and obligations
of the parties and will otherwise be reasonably acceptable to Parent and
the Shareholder Representative:   (a) As soon as possible after the Closing
Date, but no later than August 15, 2000, Parent will file with the SEC a
Registration Statement on Form S-3 (or Form S-1 if Form S-3 is not available)
(each, a "Registration Statement") registering the resale of one-third of the
shares of Common Stock issued (or issuable) to the Designated Shareholders
and Other Shareholders at the Closing. Parent will agree to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to
become effective as soon as practicable thereafter. The Designated
Shareholders and Other Shareholders will agree to provide to Parent all
information reasonably required by Parent, and otherwise to cooperate in good
faith with Parent, in the preparation of such Registration Statement. Parent
will agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to file an additional
Registration Statement to cover the resale thereunder of (i) an additional
one-third of the shares on or prior to June 30, 2001 and (ii) the balance of
the shares of Common Stock issued (or issuable) to the
Designated Shareholders and Other Shareholders at the Closing on or prior to
June 30, 2002.   (b) Parent will agree to use its reasonable efforts to
cause each Registration Statement to remain effective until the earliest of
(i) the date upon which all shares covered by such Registration Statement
have been sold to the public pursuant to such Registration Statement, (ii)
one year after the effective date   41   of such Registration Statement
and (iii) the date on which all of the shares covered by such Registration
Statement may be sold pursuant to Rule 144(k) or in any three month period
under Rule 144.   (c) Parent will not be obligated to effect a registration
pursuant to Section 5.2(a) and may suspend the Company shareholders\' rights
to make sales pursuant to an effective registration pursuant to Section
5.2(a), at any time when Parent, in the good faith judgment of its Board of
Directors, reasonably believes that the filing thereof at the time requested,
or the offering of securities pursuant thereto, would (i) materially and
adversely affect a pending or proposed acquisition, merger, recapitalization,
consolidation, reorganization or similar transaction, or negotiations,
discussions or pending proposals related thereto, or (ii) be seriously
detrimental to Parent and its shareholders, in which event (under clause (i)
or (ii) above) Parent\'s sole relief from its registration obligations is the
right to defer filing of such Registration Statement (or to suspend the
Company shareholder\'s rights to make sales pursuant to such Registration
Statement if it is already effective) for a period of not more than 60 days;
provided, however, that Parent shall not utilize the right described in this
Section 5.2(c) more than twice.   (d) The Designated Shareholders and Other
Shareholders will agree that, if so requested by Parent and the
underwriter\'s representative (if any), and so long as all of the then
officers and directors of Parent also so agree, such shareholders will not
sell or otherwise transfer any registrable securities or other securities of
Parent (other than those then eligible for re-sale under a Registration
Statement) during the ninety (90) day period following the effective date of
a registration statement of the Parent filed under the Securities Act for an
underwritten offering by the Parent of Common Stock.   (e) Parent will agree
that if Parent proposes to register any Common Stock under the Securities Act
for sale for cash in an underwritten offering (whether for Parent\'s own
account or for the account of a selling stockholder), Parent will deliver to
the Shareholder Representative notice of such proposed registration (a
"Piggyback Registration") at least 30 days prior to the filing of the
registration statement. At the written request of any Designated Shareholder
or Other Shareholder delivered to Parent in accordance with the instructions
set forth in the notice within 10 days after receipt by the Shareholder
Representative of the notice from Parent, which request shall state the
number of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger that
such Designated Shareholder or Other Shareholder wishes to sell under
the registration statement, Parent will agree to use reasonable efforts to
include in such underwritten registration such shares requested to be
included. The Designated Shareholders and Other Shareholders will agree that
if the managing underwriters of a Piggyback Registration advise Parent in
writing that in their opinion the number of securities requested to be
included in the registration exceeds the number which can be sold in the
offering, Parent may exclude from the registration any or all  
42   shares that the Designated Shareholders and Other Shareholders propose
to sell; provided, however, that no shares may be excluded if the
registration includes -------- ------- Common Stock of holders (other from
holders exercising demands registration rights for the underwritten
registration) other than the Designated Shareholders and Other Shareholders
unless the participating Designated Shareholders and Other Shareholders are
permitted to participate in such registration with such holders on a pro rata
basis.  --- ----   (f) With a view to making available the benefits of
certain rules and regulations of the SEC which may at any time permit the
sale of the Common Stock to the public without registration, at all times
after the Closing Date, Parent will agree to:   (a) make and keep public
information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144
under the Securities Act;   (b) use reasonable efforts to file with the SEC
in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of Parent under
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and   (c) furnish to each
Designated Shareholder and Other Shareholders forthwith upon request a
written statement by Parent as to its compliance with the reporting
requirements of such Rule 144 and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of Parent, and such
other reports and documents so filed by Parent as such holder may reasonably
request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing such
holder to sell any Common Stock without registration.   (d) The
Registration Rights Agreement will contain customary terms concerning
indemnification and the provision of information.   5.3 Exclusivity;
Acquisition Proposals. Unless and until this Agreement shall have been
terminated by either party pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof, the Company shall
not and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
through any officer, director, agent or otherwise, (a) solicit, initiate or
encourage submission of proposals or offers from any person relating to (i)
any acquisition or purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of, or
any equity interest in, the Company or its Subsidiaries or any
merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction with the
Company or its Subsidiaries, or (ii) any other material transaction
incompatible with the Merger (including, without limitation, a joint venture
or other similar transaction), or (b) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, furnish to any other person any confidential
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or
participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other
person to do or seek any of the foregoing.   43    5.4 Employee Matters.
Except as otherwise agreed by Parent and the Company, Parent shall offer to
all employees of the Company as of the Closing Date who are also employees of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time employment by the Parent
after the Effective Time, and each such offer shall (i) include a
compensation package in accordance with Parent\'s compensation policy, (ii)
to the extent permitted by Parent\'s employee benefit programs, enable such
eligible employee to participate in Parent\'s employee benefit programs (or
to continue to participate in the Company\'s existing benefit programs, to
the extent Parent elects to continue any such program after the Closing Date)
and other individual benefits as outlined in each employee\'s individual
offer, such as life insurance, Parent\'s 401(k) plan and Parent\'s Employee
Stock Purchase Plan ("Parent Plans"), and (iii) be in the form of
an individual offer letter prepared in accordance with Parent\'s customary
form (such letter to confirm such employee\'s initial position, compensation,
location and reporting relationship). Parent agrees that for purposes of all
Parent Plans (including all policies and employee fringe benefit programs)
under which an employee\'s benefit depends in whole or in part on length of
service, credit will be given to such employee for service previously
credited with the Company prior to the Effective Time; provided, that such
crediting of services does not result in duplication of benefits. Such
persons, if they accept such employment, shall be "at will" employees and may
be terminated by Parent for any reason or for no reason unless Parent agrees
in writing to the contrary. The Company represents that it has taken all
steps necessary to terminate and has terminated its 401(k) plans prior to the
Closing Date.   5.5 Consents. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
apply for or otherwise seek, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain (and the Company will assist Parent and Merger Sub in obtaining), all
consents and approvals required to be obtained by it for the consummation of
the Merger, including without limitation, all authorizations or waivers
required under the HSR Act. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish to
the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
may request in connection with all filings and submissions necessary under
the HSR Act. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain approval of its shareholders of the Merger, and the Company and the
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
consents, waivers and approvals under any of the Company\'s Contracts and
Permits in connection with the Merger, except such consents and approvals as
Parent and the Company mutually agree the Company shall not seek to
obtain.   5.6 Legal Conditions to the Merger. The Company and Parent shall
each take at its own expense all reasonable actions (a) to defend all
lawsuits or other legal proceedings challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) to lift or rescind
any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the
ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
(c) to effect all necessary registrations and filings   44   and

entity, and (d) to fulfill all conditions to this Agreement.   5.7 Nasdaq

issuable to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to the Agreement and
such other shares required to be reserved for issuance in connection with the
Merger authorized for listing on Nasdaq upon official notice of issuance.  
5.8 Public Announcements. Each party will consult in advance with the other
concerning the timing and content of any announcements, press releases
and public statements concerning the Merger and will not make any such
announcement, release or statement without the other\'s prior written
consent; provided,  -------- however, that Parent may make any public
statement concerning the Merger without ------- the Company\'s prior written
consent if, in the opinion of counsel for Parent, such statement or
announcement is required to comply with applicable law and Parent has
provided to the Company a copy of any such written statement or announcement
that it proposes to make before making such announcement and reasonably
considers requests for changes made by the Company.   5.9 Tax Matters.
Parent and the Company will each use reasonable efforts before and after the
Closing to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, and will not take, and will use reasonable
efforts to prevent any Affiliate of such party from taking, any actions which
could prevent the Merger from qualifying as such a reorganization, and will
take such action as is available and may be reasonably required to negate the
impact of any past actions by such party or its respective Affiliates which
would reasonably be expected to adversely impact the qualification of
the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.  6. Conditions Precedent to Obligations of Parent and Merger

warranties made by the Company, the Designated Shareholders and the Other
Shareholders in Sections 2 and 3 shall survive the Closing and shall expire
at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the Audit Release Date (other than
representations and warranties of the Company under Sections 2.3 and 2.15(a)
and (b), which shall survive until the lapsing of the applicable statute of
limitations, and the representations and warranties of the Company under

expiration date) any Indemnitee (acting in good faith) delivers to the
Shareholder Representative (as defined below) a written notice alleging the
existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of the representations and
warranties made by the Company, the Designated Shareholders or the Other
Shareholders (and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
Indemnitee\'s belief that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist) and
asserting a claim for recovery under Section 8.2 based on such alleged
inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive
such Audit Release Date (or other applicable expiration date), until such
time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. No claim
for indemnification of the type described in Section 8.2(a)(iii) may be
initiated at any time after the second anniversary of this Agreement. All
representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub shall terminate
and expire as of the Effective Time, and any liability of Parent or Merger
Sub with respect to such representations and warranties shall thereupon
cease.   (b) The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of
the Company, the Designated Shareholders and the Other Shareholders, and the
rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Indemnitees, shall not be
limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of any information furnished
to, or any investigation made by or Knowledge of, any of the Indemnitees or
any of their Representatives. Parent acknowledges that the Company Disclosure
Schedules shall be read together with applicable representations and
warranties of the Company under this Agreement.   (c) For purposes of this
Agreement, each statement or other item of information set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or in any update to the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty, or a
qualification of a representation and warranty, made by the Company,
the Designated Shareholders or Other Shareholders, as the case may be, in
this Agreement.   8.2 Indemnification by the Designated Shareholders and
Other Shareholders.   (a) From and after the Effective Time (but subject to
Section 8.1(a)), the Designated Shareholders and Other Shareholders,
severally and not jointly (on their own behalf and on behalf of their heirs,
successors and assigns, the "Indemnitors") shall hold harmless and indemnify
each of the Indemnitees from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse
each of the Indemnitees for, any Damages that are directly or indirectly
suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of the
Indemnitees may otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such
Damages relate to any third-party claim) and that arise from or as a result
of, or are directly or indirectly connected with: (i) any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 2 or  
51   in any Designated Shareholder\'s or Other Shareholders Release and
Consent (without giving effect, in any such case, to any "Material Adverse
Effect" or other materiality qualification or any similar qualification
contained or incorporated directly or indirectly in such representation or
warranty, but giving effect to any update to the Company Disclosure Schedule
delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the Closing and any dollar
threshold set forth in the representations and warranties in this Agreement);
(ii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company set forth in
this Agreement so long as such breach was not caused by the Parent\'s gross
negligence or willful misconduct, the Designated Shareholders or Other
Shareholders (including the covenants set forth in Section 5); (iii) the
transactions and other arrangements among the Company, the Designated
Shareholders and certain Other Shareholders contemplated by the CA
Shareholder Escrow and Indemnity Agreement or any other agreement or
arrangement, written or oral, entered into among the Designated Shareholders,
certain Other Shareholders and/or the Company in connection therewith; or
(iv) any Legal Proceeding relating to any inaccuracy or breach or claim of
the type referred to in clause "(i)," "(ii)" or "(iii)" above (including any
Legal Proceeding commenced by any Indemnitee for the purpose of enforcing any
of its rights under this Section 8, to the extent such Indemnitee is
successful in such Legal Proceeding). Each Indemnitor shall be
responsible under this Article 8 only for such Indemnitor\'s pro rata portion
of any  --- ---- indemnification claim arising as a result of a breach of
any representation or warranty of the Company based on the number of shares
of Common Stock to be issued to the Indemnitors in the Merger. No Indemnitor
shall be responsible hereunder for any obligations of any other Indemnitor
under this Agreement or for any breach by any other Indemnitor of such other
Indemnitor\'s representations, warranties or covenants.   (b) Each of the
Indemnitors acknowledges and agrees that, if the Surviving Corporation
suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Damages as a result of or
in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation, then (without limiting any of the rights of
the Surviving Corporation as an Indemnitee) Parent shall also be deemed, by
virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving Corporation, to have
incurred Damages as a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy
or breach.   8.3 Satisfaction of Indemnification Claim. Upon the Effective
Time, each of the Indemnitors hereby agrees that Parent may deposit shares of
Common Stock issuable to the Indemnitors in accordance with Section 1.5 into
an escrow fund ("Escrow Fund") established pursuant to an Escrow Agreement
(the "Escrow Agreement") to be executed on or before the Closing Date between
Parent, the Designated Shareholders, the Other Shareholders and the Escrow
Agent named therein in a form acceptable to Parent, the Designated
Shareholders and Other Shareholders. The number of shares of Common Stock to
be deposited in the Escrow Fund (the "Escrow Shares") shall be equal to 19%
of the total number of shares of Common Stock issued to the Indemnitors
pursuant to Section 1.5, and   52   shall be allocated on a pro rata
basis to all Indemnitors based on the number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued to each Indemnitor pursuant to the Merger. In accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Shares shall be released, subject
to Section 8.6, to satisfy a portion or all claims for indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.2, with any shares of Common Stock that are not the
subject of a claim under the Escrow Agreement to be released from such Escrow
Agreement on the Audit Release Date. For purposes of the satisfaction of
claims in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, each Escrow Share will be
deemed to have a value equal to the closing price of Common Stock on the
Closing Date.   8.4 No Contribution. Each Indemnitor hereby waives, and
acknowledges and agrees that it shall not have and shall not exercise or
assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right
of indemnity or other right or remedy against the Surviving Corporation or
any other Indemnitor in connection with any indemnification obligation or any
other liability to which he may become subject under or in connection with
this Agreement.   8.5 Matters Involving Third Parties.   (a) If any third
party shall notify any Indemnitee about any matter (a "Third Party Claim")
that may give rise to a claim for indemnification against the Indemnitors
under this Section 8, then the Indemnitee shall promptly notify the
Shareholder Representative in writing, provided, however, that no delay on
the part of any Indemnitee in notifying the Shareholder Representative shall
relieve the Indemnitors from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely
to the extent) the Indemnitors are prejudiced by the delay.   (b) The
Shareholder Representative will have the right to defend the Indemnitee
against the Third Party Claim (other than a Third Party Claim in respect of a
breach of any representation or warranty under Section 2.9) with counsel of
its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee so long as (i) the
Shareholder Representative notifies the Indemnitee in writing within 15
days after Indemnitee has given notice of the Third Party Claim that the
Indemnitors undertake the defense of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Third
Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or
other equitable relief, and (iii) the Indemnitors conduct the defense of the
Third Party Claim actively and diligently.   (c) So long as Parent
reasonably believes the Indemnitors are conducting the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with Section 8.5(b) above, (i) the Indemnitee may
retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in
the defense of the Third Party Claim and (ii) the Indemnitee will not consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Shareholder
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).  
53    (d) If the Indemnitors are not actively and diligently conducting
the defense of the Third Party Claim, or in the case of any Third Party Claim
in respect of a breach of any representation or warranty under Section 2.9,
then (i) the Indemnitee may defend against, and consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
in any manner it may deem reasonable (and the Indemnitee shall consult with,
but need not obtain any consent from, the Shareholder Representative or the
Indemnitors in connection therewith), (ii) the costs of defending against the
Third Party Claim (including attorney\'s fees and expenses) incurred by the
Indemnitors shall constitute indemnification claims hereunder, and such
claims shall be recoverable in the same manner as the applicable underlying
claim (as described in Section 8.6(d)) and (iii) the Indemnitors will remain
responsible for any Damages the Indemnitee may suffer resulting from, arising
out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party Claim to
the fullest extent provided in this Section 8, subject to the limitations in
Section 8.6(d).   8.6 Limitations on Indemnification. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary:   (a) The Indemnitees shall not assert any
claim for indemnification against the Indemnitors until such time as, and
only to the extent that, the aggregate of all claims that the Indemnitees may
have against the Indemnitors shall exceed $250,000.   (b) The aggregate
amount of all indemnification payments made pursuant to this Section 8
arising out of claims described in Section 8.2 or in Section 8.5 (other than
payments made pursuant to this Section 8 arising out of claims for
intentional misrepresentation, intentional misconduct or fraud) shall not
exceed an amount equal to 19% of the total consideration actually received by
the Indemnitors pursuant to this Agreement (valued at the closing price
on the Closing Date).   (c) The aggregate amount of all indemnification
payments made pursuant to this Section 8 shall not exceed 100% of the total
consideration actually received by the Indemnitors pursuant to this Agreement
(valued at the closing price on the Closing Date).   (d) Except with
respect to Designated Claims, all claims for indemnification under this
Section 8 (other than the reimbursement of legal expenses under Section 8.5)
shall be satisfied solely by the release of Escrow Shares in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement. In the case of Designated Claims,
Indemnitees shall have the option of pursuing such claims directly against
Indemnitors or seeking the release of Escrow Shares in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. As used herein, the term "Designated Claims"
shall mean claims arising out of any intentional misrepresentation,
intentional misconduct or fraud, or out of any breach of the representations
of the Company in   54   Sections 2.3, 2.9 (a), (b), (c ) or (f) or 2.15
(a) or (b), or out of the transactions or arrangements described in Section
8.2(a)(iii).   (e) The aggregate liability of the Indemnitors to the
Indemnitees for a breach of this Agreement or otherwise arising from the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, breach of
contract claims, indemnity claims, and tort claims (other than those claims
relating to fraud, intentional misrepresentation or intentional misconduct),
is hereby expressly limited by the limitations on indemnification set forth
in this Section 8.6.   (f) The Indemnitors shall have no liability for
claims arising out of any breach by the Company of its representations in the
last sentence of Section 2.4 as a result of the Company\'s change to
percentage completion revenue recognition practices for the 1999 fiscal
year.   (g) The Indemnitors shall have no liability for any breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant to the extent such breach resulted
from any action or omission by Parent in violation of the Management
Agreement.   8.7 Exercise of Remedies by Indemnitees Other Than Parent. No
Indemnitee (other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof)
shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other
remedy under this Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign
thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim
or the exercise of such other remedy.   8.8 Shareholder Representative.  
(a) The Designated Shareholders and the Other Shareholders shall designate a
representative prior to the Closing Date to be constituted and appointed as
agent ("Shareholder Representative") for and on behalf of the Designated
Shareholders and Other Shareholders to give and receive notices
and communications, to agree to, negotiate, and enter into, on behalf of
all Designated Shareholders and Other Shareholders, amendments, consents and
waivers under this Agreement (including Section 5.2 hereof) and the Escrow
Agreement, to enter into and administer, on behalf of the Designated
Shareholders or Other Shareholders, the Escrow Agreement, to authorize
delivery to Parent of the Common Stock or other property from the Escrow Fund
in satisfaction of indemnification claims in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment
of the Shareholder Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing;
provided, however, that the Shareholder Representative shall not agree to any
amendment that would materially adversely affect the rights of any Designated
Shareholder or Other Shareholder without the written consent of Indemnitors
holding greater than 50% of the shares of Common Stock received by all
Indemnitors pursuant to the Merger, or that adversely affects   55   any
Designated Shareholder or Other Shareholder disproportionately from
other parties without the consent of such Designated Shareholder or
Other Shareholders. Such agency may be changed by the holders of a majority
in interest of the Designated Shareholders and Other Shareholders from time
to time upon not less than 10 days\' prior written notice to Parent. No bond
shall be required of the Shareholder Representative, and the Shareholder
Representative shall receive no compensation for his services. Notices or
communications to or from the Shareholder Representative shall constitute
notice to or from each of the Designated Shareholders and Other
Shareholders.   (b) The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable for
any act done or omitted hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement as
Shareholder Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the written
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The
Company shareholders shall severally indemnify the Shareholder Representative
and hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without
gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Shareholder Representative
and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
his duties hereunder.   (c) The Shareholder Representative shall have
reasonable access to information about the Company and the reasonable
assistance of the Company\'s and Parent\'s officers and employees for
purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder,
provided that the Shareholder Representative shall treat confidentially and
not disclose any nonpublic information from or about the Company or Parent to
anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such
information confidentially).   8.9 Actions of the Shareholder
Representative. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder
Representative in respect of any action under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement shall constitute a decision of all Indemnitors and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each such Indemnitor and the Escrow Agent and
Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholder Representative hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement as being
the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such Indemnitor.
The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person (including any Indemnitor) for any acts done by them in accordance
with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholder Representative.  9. Termination   9.1 Termination.   (a)

material breach of this Agreement may terminate this Agreement under this
clause (iv).   (b) Where action is taken to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.1, it shall be sufficient for such action to be
authorized by the Board of Directors of the party taking such action.   9.2
If either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1, all obligations of the parties hereunder shall terminate without
any liability of any party to any other party (except for any liability of
any party for breach by such party of one of its covenants under
this Agreement prior to termination), provided that the agreements contained
in Section 10.2 and 10.6 hereof shall survive. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

This Escrow Agreement is made as of June 28, 2000, by and among State Street
Bank and Trust Company ("Escrow Agent"), Exchange Applications, Inc.  ------
----- ("Parent") and Steve Carpenter as agent (the "Shareholder
Representative") for  ------ ----------- -------------- the former
shareholders of Customer Analytics Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Company") listed on Exhibit A (the "Shareholders"). Terms not  -------
------- - ------------ otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set
forth in the Merger Agreement (as defined below). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the use of such defined terms incorporated by reference to the
Merger Agreement is solely for the convenience of the Parent and the
Shareholder Representative and the Escrow Agent may rely on the use of such
defined terms in any communication received by it.   WITNESSETH  
WHEREAS, Parent, Company, certain investors and shareholders of the Company,
and CAH Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent ("Merger Sub"), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of 
---------- Merger and Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement"), dated as of
June 6, 2000,  ------ --------- providing for the merger of Merger Sub with
and into the Company (the "Merger");  ------   WHEREAS, the parties intend
to establish an Escrow Fund (as defined below) to compensate Parent for
certain Damages it may incur by reason of a breach of the representations,
warranties or covenants of Shareholder Representative and Company contained
in the Merger Agreement; and   WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to set
forth further terms and conditions in addition to those set forth in the
Merger Agreement relating to the operation of the Escrow Fund.   NOW,
THEREFORE, the parties hereto, in consideration of the mutual covenants
contained herein, and intending to be legally bound, hereby agree
as follows:   1. Escrow Shares and Escrow Fund. As soon as practicable
after  ----------------------------- the Effective Time, nineteen percent
(19%) of the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued to the
Shareholders pursuant to Section 1.5 of the Merger Agreement in the amount of
761,602 shares (the "Escrow Shares") shall be  ------------- registered in
the name of each Shareholder as set forth on Exhibit A, and be  -------
- deposited with the Escrow Agent with stock powers duly executed in blank,
such deposit to constitute the "Escrow Fund" and to be governed by the terms
set  ------ ---- forth    -2-  herein. The Escrow Agent shall have no
responsibility for the genuineness, validity, market value, title or
sufficiency for any intended purpose of the Escrow Shares. The Escrow Fund
shall be available to Parent to satisfy a portion or all claims for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Merger Agreement and subject
to the limitations in Section 8.6 of the Merger Agreement. Parent and Company
each acknowledge that such Damages, if any, would relate to unresolved
contingencies existing at the Effective Time, which if resolved at the
Effective Time would have led to a reduction in the total number of
shares Parent would have agreed to issue in connection with the Merger.
Nothing herein shall limit the provisions of Section 8 of the Merger
Agreement with respect to the liability (i) of Company for any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant if the Merger does not close, (ii) of
any Shareholder in connection with any indemnification claim, or (iii) of any
rights of Parent to seek indemnification under Section 8 of the Merger
Agreement. The number of Escrow Shares owned of record by each Shareholder is
set forth in Exhibit A attached  ------- - hereto, which allotment is pro
rata based upon the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the
former shareholders of Company as of the Closing of the Merger.   The
Shareholders shall remain as record owners of the Escrow Shares unless they
are transferred to Parent or the Shareholder Representative pursuant to this
Escrow Agreement and as a result the Shareholders shall retain all rights and
benefits of a shareholder of the Parent, including, but not limited to,
the right to vote all such shares in accordance with Section 6(b) hereof and
the right to receive dividends and distributions in accordance with Section
9 hereof.   Upon execution of this Agreement, each Shareholder listed on
Exhibit A shall deliver to the Escrow Agent three stock powers bearing
signature guarantees. The Escrow Agent shall at any time be entitled to
request in writing from the Shareholder Representative additional stock
powers. If the Escrow Agent is not in timely receipt of three stock powers
from each Shareholder upon execution of this Agreement, or any stock powers
requested by the Escrow Agent thereafter, then the Shareholders agree,
jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless as to
any liability incurred by it by reason of its not having received the
necessary stock powers in order to carry out its duties and obligations under
this Agreement, and to reimburse the Escrow Agent for all of its costs or
expenses, including, among other things, counsel fees and expenses,
reasonably incurred by reason of its duties hereunder.   The Shareholder
Representative represents and warrants to the Escrow Agent that he has the
irrevocable right, power and authority (i) to enter into and perform this
Escrow Agreement and bind all of the Shareholders to its terms, (ii) to give
and receive directions and notices hereunder, and (iii) to make
all determinations that may be required or that he deems appropriate under
this Escrow Agreement. For purposes of Sections 8(a) and 12 of this
Escrow    -3-  Agreement, the Shareholder Representative shall be
entitled to act only in accordance with the instructions of holders of a
majority in interest of the Escrow Shares subject to this Escrow Agreement.
The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to determine the shareholder
Representative\'s compliance with the foregoing.   Until notified in
writing by the Shareholder Representative that he has resigned or by a
majority in interest of the Shareholders that he has been removed, the Escrow
Agent may act upon the directions, instructions and notices of the
Shareholder Representative named above and, thereafter, upon the directions,
instructions and notices of any successor named in a writing executed by a
majority in interest of the Shareholders filed with the Escrow Agent.   2.
Damage Threshold. Parent may not receive any shares from the Escrow 
---------------- Fund unless and until an Officer\'s Certificate or
Certificates (as defined in Section 5 below) identifying Damages the
aggregate amount of which exceeds $250,000 has been delivered to the Escrow
Agent as provided in Section 5 below, and such amount is determined pursuant
to this Escrow Agreement to be payable, in which case Parent shall receive
shares equal in value to the full amount of Damages in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement as set forth in Section 5.   3. Rights and
Obligations of the Parties. The Escrow Agent shall be 
------------------------------------- entitled to such rights and shall
perform such duties of the Escrow Agent as set forth herein, in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent
shall have no obligation to invest any escrowed property. Parent and
Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to their respective rights and
shall perform their respective duties and obligations as set forth herein, in
accordance with the terms hereof. In the event that the terms of this Escrow
Agreement conflict in any way with the provisions of the Merger Agreement
solely as between the Shareholder Representative and Parent, the Merger
Agreement shall control.   4. Escrow Period. Subject to the provisions of
Section 6(c), the Escrow  ------------- Period shall terminate upon the
earlier of (i) the expiration of one (1) year following the Effective Time
being June 28, 2001, and (ii) the date Parent files its Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2000. Parent will inform Escrow
Agent in writing of the termination of the Escrow Period pursuant to this
Section 4. In the event of a termination prior to June 28, 2001, the
Shareholder Representative may also provide such notice of termination so
long as it is accompanied by a copy of Parent\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year end December 31, 2000.    -4-   5. Claims upon Escrow
Fund.  -----------------------   (a) Subject to Section 7, claims may be
made against the Escrow Fund upon receipt by the Escrow Agent on or before
the last day of the Escrow Period of a certificate signed by any officer of
Parent (an "Officer\'s Certificate"):  --------- -----------   (i) stating
that Damages exist in an aggregate amount greater than $250,000.00;   (ii)
specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of such Damages included
in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid, or property
accrued or arose, the nature of the misrepresentation, and the breach of
warranty or claim to which such item is related, the Escrow Agent
shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 7 and 8, deliver to Parent out
of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, Parent Common Stock or other
assets held in the Escrow Fund having a value equal to such Damages as
determined pursuant to Section 5(b) below; and   (iii) certifying as to the
simultaneous delivery of such Officer\'s Certificate to the Shareholder
Representative.   (b) For the purpose of compensating Parent for its Damages
pursuant to this Agreement, the Parent Common Stock in the Escrow Fund shall
be valued at the Parent Common Stock closing price as listed on The Nasdaq
Stock Market on the Closing Date as certified to the Escrow Agent by Parent.
The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon any such
certification of value without any duty to verify or recalculate the same and
the Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action or omission of, or delay
on the part of, Parent in such connection. Notwithstanding any term hereof to
the contrary, in any such instance, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
refrain from taking any action otherwise required hereunder (and which
requires a determination of fair market value), without liability on its
part, until it is provided with notice in accordance with this Agreement. In
lieu of releasing any fractional Escrow Shares, any fraction of a released
Escrow Share that would otherwise be released shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole Escrow Share.   6. Duties of Escrow Agent. The duties of the
Escrow Agent shall include  ---------------------- the following:   (a)
The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Shares during the Escrow
Period, and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow shares only in accordance
with the terms of this Escrow Agreement.   Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be under no obligation to preserve,
protect or exercise rights in the Escrow    -5-  Shares, and shall be
responsible only for reasonable measures to maintain the physical safekeeping
thereof and otherwise to perform and observe such duties on its part as are
expressly set forth in this Agreement.   (b) The Escrow Shares shall be
voted by the record owners of such shares. The Escrow Agent shall, at least
three business days prior to the date on which the Escrow Agent is requested
to take any action, deliver to the Shareholder Representative a proxy or
other instrument in the form supplied to it by the Shareholder Representative
for voting or otherwise exercising any right to consent with respect to any
of the Escrow Shares held by it hereunder, to authorize therein the
Shareholder Representative to exercise such voting or consent authority in
respect of the Escrow Shares. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for
forwarding to any party, notifying any party with respect to, or taking any
action with respect to, any notice, solicitation or other document
or information, written or otherwise, received from an issuer or other person
with respect to the Escrow Shares, including but not limited to, proxy
material, tenders, options, the pendency of calls and maturities and
expiration of rights.   (c) Promptly following termination of the Escrow
Period as set forth in Section 4 hereof, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to
the Shareholders the number of Escrow Shares valued as set forth in Section 5
and other property in the Escrow Fund in excess of any amount of such Escrow
Shares or other property sufficient, subject to the objection of the
Shareholder Representative and the subsequent arbitration of the matter in
the manner provided in Section 8 hereof, to satisfy any unsatisfied claims
specified in any Officer\'s Certificate theretofore delivered to the Escrow
Agent prior to termination of the Escrow Period with respect to facts and
circumstances existing prior to expiration of the Escrow Period, and to pay
expenses as provided in Section 15(b) hereof. As soon as all such claims have
been resolved and the Escrow Agent has received a written notice from Parent
to that effect, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to such Shareholders all of
the Escrow Shares and other property remaining in the Escrow Fund and not
required to satisfy such claims and expenses. Each Shareholder shall receive
Escrow Shares pro rata according to their Percentage Interests as set forth
opposite the name of each such Shareholder on Exhibit A  ------- - hereto.
Parent shall promptly instruct the transfer agent of the Parent Common Stock
to deliver certificates representing Parent Common Stock to each Shareholder
as directed by the Escrow Agent to carry out the intent of this Section.  
(d) Under no circumstances should the terms of this Agreement  -- require
the Escrow Agent to release or distribute escrow funds or property sooner
than two (2) business days after the Escrow Agent has received the requisite
notices or paperwork in good form, or passage of the applicable claims period
or release date, as the case may be.    -6-   (e) To the extent directed
to do so by the Shareholder Representative, the Escrow Agent shall sell or
deliver to the Shareholder Representative with the accompanying stock power a
sufficient number of the shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow
Fund, and shall apply the proceeds of such sale, to pay expenses reasonably
incurred by the Shareholder Representative on behalf of the Shareholders as
provided in Section 15(b) hereof.   (f) In connection with any sale of the
Escrow Shares pursuant to Section 6(e) of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to receive and rely upon, prior to taking action in that
regard, written direction from the Shareholder Representative as to the
manner and method to be undertaken in carrying out such sale, including
without limitation written direction (i) identifying the number of shares to
be sold, (ii) identifying the brokerage firm the Shareholder Representative
requests to be used or instructing the Escrow Agent to use its affiliated
brokerage service, and (iii) setting forth any necessary or special
instructions with respect to the sale (including any stop loss or minimum
price per share instruction); and the Shareholder Representative shall
execute and deliver any instruments reasonably required by the Escrow Agent
in order to carry out such sale or liquidation.   (g) The Escrow Agent shall
have no responsibility in connection with such sale other than to make
delivery of the Escrowed Shares to the selected brokerage firm, with
instruction (including any special instruction provided by the Shareholder
Representative, and to receive and deposit into the Escrow Account (to be
administered and distributed in accordance with this Agreement) any net sale
proceeds received therefrom. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty
or obligation to determine or accomplish compliance with any applicable
transfer restrictions; and it shall be the sole obligation of the party
directing such sale to take any remaining actions, and to provide or deliver
any necessary instruments or opinions (at its expense) necessary to comply
with applicable transfer restrictions or applicable securities laws. The
Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any actions or omissions of any such
brokerage firm, and shall have no liability for the price or execution
achieved. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Shareholder
Representative expressly acknowledges that (a) the Escrow Shares may need to
be sent to a transfer agent to be reissued in saleable form, (b) the Escrow
Shares may contain or be subject to transfer restrictions that may limit
their marketability and impose restrictions upon the number or types of
purchasers to whom they can be offered or sold, and (c) the Escrow Agent
shall have no liability for any failure or delay (or any price change during
any such delay) on the part of the Shareholder Representative or any transfer
agent, or caused by any necessary registration or delivery procedures, or
compliance with any applicable transfer restrictions involved in the transfer
of such Escrow Shares.    -7-   (h) The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
contract with any brokerage firm (which may be selected by the Escrow Agent
without liability on its part, taking into consideration any brokerage firm
requested by the Shareholder Representative, as provided above), which may be
affiliated with the Escrow Agent, and may enter into any such contract on a
basis which provides that such brokerage firm shall use its "best efforts" to
effect such sale. The Escrow Agent shall be indemnified hereunder for any
costs, expenses and risks associated therewith or arising thereunder (other
than resulting from its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), and the
proceeds of sale to which the Shareholder Representative shall be entitled
shall be net of all brokerage commissions and charges.   (i) The net sale
proceeds of any such sale of Escrow Shares received by the Escrow Agent shall
be applied to pay expenses incurred by the Shareholder Representative
pursuant to Section 15(b) hereof net of a fee for the preparation of an
individual 1099-B (the "Sales Administration Fee"). The Sales Administration
fee shall be assessed each day a sale is affected until the total number of
shares specified in such written direction from the
Shareholder Representative are sold; provided that the minimum Sales
Administration Fee per sale transaction shall be $500.00.   (j) In no event
shall the Escrow Agent be liable for indirect, punitive, special or
consequential damage or loss (including but not limited to lost profits)
whatsoever, even if the Escrow Agent has been informed of the likelihood of
such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.   (k) The Escrow
Agent shall have no more or less responsibility or liability on account of
any action or omission of any book entry depository, securities intermediary
or other sub escrow agent employed by the Escrow Agent than any such book
entry depository, securities intermediary or other sub escrow agent has to
the Escrow Agent, except to the extent that such action or omission of any
book entry depository, securities intermediary or other sub escrow agent was
caused by the Escrow Agent\'s own gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct in breach of this Escrow Agreement.   7. Objections to
Claim. At the time of delivery of any Officer\'s 
------------------- Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such
Officer\'s Certificate shall be delivered to the Shareholder Representative
and for a period of fifteen (15) business days (the "Objection Period") after
receipt by the Escrow Agent of  ----------------- the Officer\'s Certificate
shall make no delivery of Parent Common Stock or other property pursuant to
Section 5 hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written
authorization from the Shareholder Representative to make such delivery.
After the expiration of such Objection Period, the Escrow Agent   
-8-  shall make delivery of the Parent Common Stock or other property in the
Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 5 hereof, provided that no such
payment or delivery may be made if the Shareholder Representative shall
object in a written statement to the claim made in the Officer\'s
Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent
and to Parent prior to the expiration of such Objection Period.   8.
Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration. 
------------------------------------   (a) In case the Shareholder
Representative shall so object in writing to any claim or claims by Parent
made in any Officer\'s Certificate, Parent shall have fifteen (15) business
days (the "Response Period") to respond in a written 
--------------- statement to the objection of the Shareholder Representative.
If after such Response Period there remains a dispute as to any claims, the
Shareholder Representative and Parent shall attempt in good faith for thirty
(30) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to
each of such claims. If the Shareholder Representative and Parent should so
agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed
by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and shall distribute the
Parent Common Stock or other property from the Escrow Fund in accordance with
the terms thereof.   (b) If no such agreement can be reached after good
faith negotiation, either Parent or the Shareholder Representative may, by
written notice to the other, demand arbitration of the matter unless the
amount of the damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third
party, in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is
ascertained or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event
the matter shall be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators.
Within fifteen (15) days after such written notice is sent, Parent and the
Shareholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator, and the two
arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. The decision of the
arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer\'s
Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Section 5 hereof, the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make
or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.   (c)
Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in
Suffolk County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, under the commercial rules
then in effect of the American Arbitration Association.   9. Distributions.
Any cash dividends (but excluding any distributions  ------------- received
upon a stock split, merger or other recapitalization or reorganization,   
-9-  or upon a liquidating distribution the "Retained Escrow Earnings")
shall be  ------------------------ promptly distributed by the Parent to the
record owner of the Escrow Shares to which such distribution relates. If,
notwithstanding the foregoing, any cash dividends (but excluding any Retained
Escrow Earnings) are received by the Escrow Agent such cash dividends shall
be promptly distributed by the Escrow Agent to the record owner of the Escrow
Shares to which such distribution relates. Any other distributions including
any Retained Escrow Earnings, shall be directed by Parent (and the
Shareholders, as record owners of such Escrow Shares, hereby authorize
Parent) to the Escrow Agent to be added to the Escrow Fund and become a part
hereof. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any Retained Escrow Earnings are
received by any Shareholder, such Retained Escrow Earnings shall be promptly
distributed by such Shareholder to the Escrow Agent. Any provision hereof
shall be equitably adjusted to appropriately reflect any stock split, reverse
stock split, merger or other recapitalization or reorganization based upon
written instructions from Parent to the Escrow Agent.   10. Exculpatory
Provisions.  ----------------------   (a) The Escrow Agent shall not be
responsible for any of the agreements referred to or described herein
(including without limitation the Merger Agreement), or for determining or
compelling compliance therewith, and shall not otherwise be bound thereby.
The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties
as are specifically set forth herein (which duties are ministerial and not
fiduciary) and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from
acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall
not be liable for forgeries or false presentations. The Escrow Agent shall
not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as escrow agent except
for gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Escrow Agent shall in no case
or event be liable for any representations or warranties of Company, Parent,
the Shareholder Representative, the Shareholders or Merger Sub. Any act done
or omitted pursuant to the advice or opinion of counsel, including in-
house counsel, shall be conclusive evidence of the good faith of the Escrow
Agent; and the Escrow Agent will be entitled to rely on the advice of such
counsel. The Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to take any legal or other
action hereunder which might in its judgment involve or cause it to incur any
expense or liability unless it shall have been furnished with acceptable
indemnification.   (b) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to
disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any
other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of law or
arbitration as provided herein, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply
with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court or rulings of any
arbitrators. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such order,
judgment or decree of any court or such ruling of    -10-  any
arbitrator, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto
or to any other person by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such
order, judgment, decree or arbitrators\' ruling being subsequently
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have been
entered without jurisdiction.   (c) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in
any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties
executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver the Escrow
Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for thereunder.  
(d) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any change in,
modification, recission or clarification of law adversely affecting any
rights under any statute of limitation with respect to the Escrow Agreement
or any documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.   11. Alteration of
Duties. This Escrow Agreement may be altered, amended, 
-------------------- modified or revoked only by a writing signed by the
Escrow Agent, Parent, the Shareholder Representative and Shareholders holding
a majority of the Escrow Shares.   12. Resignation and Removal of the
Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent may 
------------------------------------------- resign as Escrow Agent at any
time with or without cause by giving at least thirty (30) days\' prior
written notice to each of Parent and the Shareholder Representative, such
resignation to be effective thirty (30) days following the date such notice
is given. In addition, Parent and the Shareholder Representative may jointly
remove the Escrow Agent as escrow agent at any time with or without cause, by
an instrument (which may be executed in counterparts) given to the Escrow
Agent, which instrument shall designate the effective date of such removal.
In the event of any such resignation or removal, a successor escrow agent,
which shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United
States of America or of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts having a combined
capital and surplus of not less than $100,000,000, shall be appointed by the
Shareholder Representative with the approval of Parent, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Any such successor escrow agent shall deliver
to Parent and the Shareholder Representative a written instrument accepting
such appointment, and thereupon it shall succeed to all the rights and duties
of the Escrow Agent hereunder and shall be entitled to receive the
Escrow Fund. If no successor escrow agent is named by the Shareholder
Representative, the Escrow Agent may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for appointment of a successor Escrow Agent.   13. Further
Instruments. If the Escrow Agent reasonably requires other or 
------------------- further instruments in connection with performance of its
duties    -11-  hereunder, the necessary parties hereto shall join in
furnishing such instruments.   14. Disputes. It is understood and agreed
that should any dispute arise  -------- with respect to the delivery and/or
ownership or right of possession of the securities held by the Escrow Agent
hereunder, the Escrow Agent is authorized and directed to act in accordance
with, and shall be entitled (at its sole option and election) to retain in
its possession without liability to anyone, all or any of said Escrow Fund
until such dispute shall have been settled either by the mutual written
agreement of parties involved or by a final order, decree or judgment of a
court in the United States of America, the time for perfection of an appeal
of such order, decree or judgment having expired. The Escrow Agent may, but
shall be under no duty whatsoever to, institute or defend any
legal proceedings that relate to the Escrow Fund directed to act in
accordance with, and in reliance upon, the terms hereof.   15. Escrow Fees
and Expenses.  ------------------------   (a) Parent shall pay the Escrow
Agent such fees as are established by the Fee Schedule attached hereto as
Exhibit B.  ------- -   (b) Any out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by
the Shareholder Representative shall be paid by the Shareholders based upon
their Percentage Interests within ten (10) days of a written request from the
Shareholder Representative. Should such fees and expenses not be paid within
forty-five (45) days from the date requested, the Shareholder Representative
may cause such amounts to be paid out of the Escrow Fund in preference to
other distributions from such Escrow Fund; provided, however, that the
aggregate of such payments shall not exceed the proceeds of sales of shares
made pursuant to Section 6(d) hereof if and to the extent that this would
reduce the number of shares distributed to Parent, and provided further that
under no circumstances will the Shareholder Representative have personal
liability for any such fees and expenses. In the event any fees and expenses
of Shareholder Representative are not paid pursuant to this Section 15(b),
then the Shareholders shall indemnify Shareholder Representative pursuant to
Section 17(a).   16. Indemnification.  ---------------   (a) In
consideration of the Escrow Agent\'s acceptance of this appointment, Parent
agrees to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent (and its officers, directors,
employees and agents) harmless as to any liability incurred by it to any
person, firm or corporation by reason of its having accepted such appointment
or in carrying out the terms hereof and the Merger Agreement, and   
-12-  to reimburse the Escrow Agent for all its costs and expenses,
including, among other things, counsel fees and expenses, reasonably incurred
by reason of its duties hereunder; provided, however, that no indemnity need
be paid in case of the Escrow Agent\'s gross negligence, willful misconduct
or breach of this Escrow Agreement. The Shareholder Representative shall not
be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder or under the Merger Agreement
as Shareholder Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise
of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of
counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith.   (b) Parent
agrees to indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from any liability or
obligations on account of taxes, assessments, additions for late payment,
interest, penalties, expenses and other governmental charges that may be
assessed or asserted against the Escrow Agent and any loss, liability
or expense incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of
the Shareholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with or
relating to any payment made or other activities performed under the terms of
this Agreement, including without limitation any liability for the
withholding or deduction of (or the failure to withhold or deduct) the same,
and any liability for failure to obtain proper certifications or to report
properly to governmental authorities in connection with this Agreement,
including costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses),
interest and penalties. The foregoing indemnification and agreement to hold
harmless shall survive the termination of this Agreement; provided, however,
that no indemnity need be paid in case of the Escrow Agent\'s gross
negligence, willful misconduct or breach of this Escrow Agreement.   17.
Shareholder Representative.  --------------------------   (a) As between
the Shareholders and the Shareholder Representative, the Shareholders shall
severally indemnify the Shareholder Representative and hold him harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or
bad faith on the part of the Shareholder Representative and arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder
or under the Merger Agreement. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholder Representative in respect of any action under this Agreement or
the Merger Agreement shall constitute a decision of all Shareholders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Shareholder and the
Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholder Representative hereunder or under the Escrow
Agreement as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each
and every such Shareholder and shall be entitled to take action consented to
by a majority of the Shareholders. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby
relieved from any liability to any    -13-  Person (including any
Shareholder) for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative.   (b) The
Shareholder Representative shall not be responsible for any of the agreements
referred to or described herein (including without limitation the Merger
Agreement), or for determining or compelling compliance therewith, and shall
not otherwise be bound thereby. The Shareholder Representative shall
be obligated only for the performance of such duties as are specifically set
forth herein (which duties are ministerial and not fiduciary) and may rely
and shall be protected in relying or refraining from acting on any instrument
reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the
proper party or parties. The Shareholder Representative shall not be liable
for forgeries or false presentations. The Shareholder Representative shall
not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Shareholder
Representative except for gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Shareholder Representative shall in no case or event be liable for any
representations or warranties of Company, Parent, the Shareholder
Representative, the Shareholders or Merger Sub. Any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice or opinion of counsel, shall be conclusive evidence of
the good faith of the Shareholder Representative; and the Shareholder
Representative will be entitled to rely on the advice of such counsel. The
Shareholder Representative shall not be obligated to take any legal or other
action hereunder which might in its judgment involve or cause it to incur any
expense or liability unless it shall have been furnished with acceptable
indemnification.   (c) The Shareholder Representative is hereby expressly
authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties
hereto or by any other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of
law or arbitration as provided herein, and is hereby expressly authorized to
comply with and obey orders, judgments or decrees of any court or rulings of
any arbitrators. In case the Shareholder Representative obeys or complies
with any such order, judgment or decree of any court or such ruling of any
arbitrator, the Shareholder Representative shall not be liable to any of the
parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such compliance,
notwithstanding any such order, judgment, decree or arbitrators\' ruling
being subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found
to have been entered without jurisdiction.   (d) The Shareholder
Representative shall not be liable in any respect on account of the identity,
authority or rights of the parties executing or delivering or purporting to
execute or deliver the Escrow Agreement or any documents or papers deposited
or called for thereunder.   (e) The Shareholder Representative shall not be
liable for any change in, modification, recission or clarification of law
adversely affecting any rights    -14-  under any statute of limitation
with respect to the Escrow Agreement or any documents deposited with the
Shareholder Representative.   18. General.  -------   (a) Any notice
