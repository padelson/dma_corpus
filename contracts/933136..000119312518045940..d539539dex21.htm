thereof).

the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger

such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective, the "
_Effective Time_ ").

Section 2.4 _Surviving Corporation Matters_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth on
_Exhibit_ __ _ A_, and as so amended and restated shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until further amended in accordance
with applicable Law.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except the references to
Merger Subs name shall be replaced by references to "Nationstar Mortgage
Holdings Inc.", until further amended in accordance with the provisions
thereof and applicable Law.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, until their successors have been duly
elected or appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation, incapacity or removal: ( _i_ ) the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the

prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 2.5 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Company and Merger
Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the Parties or any holder of any securities of the Company or
Merger Sub:

(a) All shares of Company Stock that are owned, directly or indirectly, by
Parent, the Company (including shares held as treasury stock or otherwise) or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(b) Each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, including Company Restricted Stock (other than shares (
_x_ ) to be canceled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_, and ( _y_ )
subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.9_) shall at the Effective
Time be converted into the right to receive (without interest, subject to
reduction for any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof and
further subject to the provisions of this _Article II_ ):

 

(i) Each share of Company Stock with respect to which an election to receive
cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been effectively made (or deemed made) and
not revoked pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ _(a)_ (each, a " _Cash Electing
Company Share_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive $18.00 in cash
(the " _Per Share Cash_

 



18   _Election Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the product
of the number of Cash Electing Company Shares and the Per Share Cash Election
Consideration (such product being the " _Cash Election Amount_ ") exceeds
$1,225,885,248.00 (the " _Maximum Cash Amount_ "), then each Cash Electing
Company Share shall be converted into a right to receive ( _A_ ) an amount of
cash (without interest) equal to the product (rounded to two decimal places)
of ( _I_ ) the Per Share Cash Election Consideration and ( _II_ ) a fraction,
the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Cash Amount and the denominator
of which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction being the " _Cash
Fraction_ ") and ( _B_ ) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of ( _x_ ) the
Exchange Ratio and ( _y_ ) one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

(ii) Each share of Company Stock with respect to which an election to receive
stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") has been effectively made (or
deemed made) and not revoked pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ _(a)_  (each, a
" _Stock Electing Company Share_ ") shall be converted into 12.7793 validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (such
number, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), subject to adjustment in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.6_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Maximum Cash Amount
exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then each Stock Electing Company Share shall
be converted into the right to receive ( _A_ ) an amount of cash (without
interest) equal to the amount (rounded to two decimal places) of such excess
divided by the number of Stock Electing Company Shares and ( _B_ ) a number of
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product (rounded to four decimal places) of ( _I_ ) the Exchange
Ratio and ( _II_ ) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Per
Share Cash Election Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause (A)
of this paragraph and the denominator of which shall be the Per Share Cash
Election Consideration.

 

(iii) The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued and/or cash payable upon
the conversion of a share of Company Stock pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.5(b)_ and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.9_, are referred to collectively as the "
_Merger Consideration_ ".

(c) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
2.5_ shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of ( _i_ ) a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") or ( _ii_
) shares of Company Stock held in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except (subject to 
_Section_ __ _ 2.9_) the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in _Section_ __
_ 2.10_.

 

(d) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.6 _Cash and Stock Elections_.

 

(a) Each Person who, on or prior to the Election Deadline, is a record holder
of shares of Company Stock (including Company Restricted Stock) other than
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to specify the number of such holders
shares of Company Stock with respect to which such holder makes a Cash
Election or a Stock Election. For purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, any
reference to "shares of Company Stock" shall also include Company RSUs, as
applicable, _mutatis mutandis_.

 

(b) Parent shall prepare and file as an exhibit to the Registration Statement,
a form of election (the " _Form of Election_ ") in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company. Not less than twenty (20) Business Days
prior to the Election Deadline, the Exchange Agent shall mail the Form of
Election to all Persons who are record holders of shares of Company Stock as
of the record date for the Company Meeting. The Form of Election shall be used
by each record holder of shares of Company Stock (or, in the case of nominee
record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and
documentation) to elect either a Cash Election or a Stock Election as to each
such share of Company Stock held by such holder. In the event that a holder
fails to make a

 



19  Cash Election or a Stock Election with respect to any shares of Company
Stock held or beneficially owned by such holder by the Election Deadline, then
such holder shall be deemed to have made a Stock Election with respect to
those shares of Company Stock for which no election was made (each such share
of Company Stock, a " _Non-Electing Company Share_"). The Exchange Agent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to make the Form of Election available to all
Persons who become record holders of shares of Company Stock during the period
between the record date for the Company Meeting and the Election Deadline, and
the Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform as specified herein and as specified in any
agreement with the Exchange Agent.

 

(c) Any holders election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have received at its designated office by 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on the date that is three (3) Business Days preceding the Closing
Date (the " _Election Deadline_ "), a Form of Election properly completed and
signed and accompanied by any additional documents required by the procedures
set forth in the Form of Election. After a Cash Election or a Stock Election
is validly made with respect to any shares of Company Stock, no further
registration of transfers of such shares of Company Stock shall be made on
the stock transfer books of the Company, unless and until such Cash Election
or Stock Election is properly revoked in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.6(e)_.

 

(d) Parent and the Company shall publicly announce the anticipated Election
Deadline at least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election
Deadline. If the Closing Date is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election
Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date, and Parent and the
Company shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined,
the rescheduled Election Deadline.

(e) Any Cash Election or Stock Election may be revoked with respect to all or
a portion of the shares of Company Stock subject thereto by the holder who
submitted the applicable Form of Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. If a Cash Election or a Stock
Election is revoked, the shares of Company Stock as to which such election
previously applied shall be treated as Non-Electing Company Shares in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.6(b)_ unless a contrary election is
submitted by the holder within the period during which elections are
permitted to be made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.6(c)_. The accounts of
holders of Book-Entry Shares will not be credited at the Depository Trust
Company, unless the holder so requests. 

(f) The reasonable good faith determination of the Exchange Agent (or the
reasonable good faith determination of Parent, in the event that the Exchange
Agent declines to make any such determination) shall be conclusive and binding
as to whether or not Cash Elections and Stock Elections shall have been
properly made or revoked pursuant to this _Section_ _2.6_ , as to when Cash
Elections, Stock Elections and revocations were received by the Exchange Agent
and to disregard immaterial defects in the completed Forms of Election. None
of Parent or the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation
to notify any Person of any defect in a completed Form of Election. The
Exchange Agent (or Parent, in the event that the Exchange Agent declines to
make the following computations) shall also make all computations contemplated
by  _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_, and absent manifest error this computation shall
be conclusive and binding. The Exchange Agent may, with the written agreement
of Parent (subject to the consent of the Company, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any rules as are
consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ for the implementation of the Cash
Elections and Stock Elections provided for in this Agreement as shall be
necessary or desirable to administer these Cash Elections and Stock
Elections.

Section 2.7 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (
_a_ ) the Effective Time and ( _b_ ) any termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock, the outstanding shares of Parent Series B Preferred Stock or the
outstanding shares of Company Stock (or the securities convertible into or
exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock, Parent Series B Preferred
Stock or shares of Company Stock) shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction,
or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within

 



20  said period, then the Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any other
similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted
to provide Parent and the holders of Company Stock (including Company
Restricted Stock and Company RSUs), as the case may be, the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ shall be construed to permit any Party to take any
action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of
this Agreement.

Section 2.8  _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion
of Company Stock pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
holder of Parent Common Stock. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_, all
fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled shall be
aggregated, and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places. In
lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of Company Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount
in cash, without interest, rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the
product of (i) the amount of the fractional share interest in a share of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled under _Section_ __ _
2.5(b)_ (or would be entitled but for this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_) and (ii) an
amount equal to the Closing Volume-Weighted Average Price. The amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of Company Stock in lieu of any fractional share
interests in Parent Common Stock shall be paid by the Exchange Agent, without
interest, to the holders of Company Stock entitled to receive such cash at the
time of payment of the other Merger Consideration to which such holders are
entitled.

 

Section 2.9 _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a)_) and that are held by any Person who
is entitled to demand and has properly exercised appraisal rights in respect
of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Appraisal
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, but rather the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment by the Surviving Corporation of
the "fair value" of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the
"fair value" of such holders Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been cancelled and converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_. The
Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Stock, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
received by the Company. Parent shall have the right to participate in and
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 2.10 _Exchange of Company Stock_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange
agreement with a nationally recognized bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At
or immediately following the Effective Time on the Closing Date, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Company Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ , through the
Exchange Agent, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable (whether
represented in certificated or non-certificated direct registration form)
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_ in exchange for shares of Company Stock
outstanding at the Effective Time. At or immediately following the
Effective Time on the Closing Date, Parent shall provide or shall cause to be
provided to the Exchange Agent an aggregate amount of cash equal to the
Maximum Cash Amount to pay the cash portion of the Merger Consideration (such
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash provided to the Exchange Agent under
this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_ _(a)_ , the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For the purposes
of such deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange
Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund,

 



21  from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.9_. The Exchange Agent
shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 2.5_ out of the Exchange Fund. Except as provided in _Section_ __ _
2.10(g)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the fifth Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_,
( _x_ ) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary
form) and ( _y_ ) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay
and deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
may be made and shares may be issued to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.10(b)(i)_, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously represented by
such Certificate, and no dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of, or in respect of, any Certificate with respect to the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable upon surrender thereof.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article II_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record
of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Stock were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.5_ shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration multiplied by
the number of shares of Company Stock previously represented by such Book-
Entry Shares, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
conversion of any Book-Entry Shares. To the extent any shares of Parent Common
Stock are deliverable to any holder under this _Section_ __ _ 2.10(b_ _)(_
_ii)_ , such shares shall be deemed issued to such holder on the Closing Date
and, consequently, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to any
dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time in the same manner as other holders of shares of
Parent Common Stock.

 

(c) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately, in
the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Stock. After the

 



22  Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Stock
are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
II_.

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Stock for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holder of
Company Stock who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim
for the Merger Consideration.

(e) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable and customary amount as Parent
or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration had such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate been surrendered as provided in this _Article II_.

(g) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such investment income or
gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company
Stock. Any interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments
shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its
request, and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to
the benefit of holders of Company Stock; _provided_ , _further_ , that any
investment of such cash shall in all events be limited to direct short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by, the U.S. government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available), and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock pursuant to this _Article II_.
If for any reason (including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into
the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

 

Section 2.11 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such
actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest
in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 



23 Section 2.12 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company RSUs and Company Restricted Stock_. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 5.1(b)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, Company Restricted
Stock and Company RSUs shall be treated as follows. Effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding share of
Company Restricted Stock shall automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, automatically vest in full and shall be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in _Section_
__ _ 2.5(b)_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each then-outstanding Company RSU (whether vested or unvested) shall
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
automatically vest in full and be assumed by Parent and converted into a
Parent restricted stock unit (a " _Converted RSU_ ") entitling the holder
thereof to receive upon settlement the Merger Consideration, as elected by the
holder of the Company RSU in accordance with the procedures set out in
_Section_ __ _ 2.6_, based on the number of shares of Company Stock
underlying or represented by the number of Company RSUs as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by ( _i_ ) if the holder thereof makes
a Cash Election, the Per Share Cash Election Consideration, or ( _ii_ ) if
the holder thereof makes a Stock Election, the consideration applicable to a
Stock Electing Company Share, and subject in each case to adjustment as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_ in the event the Cash Election Amount is
greater than or less than the Maximum Cash Amount and as provided in _Section_
__ _ 2.9_. Each such Converted RSU shall be settled, and payment of such
Merger Consideration with respect to such Company RSUs, including delivery of
any Parent Common Stock, shall be made as soon as practicable but no later
than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time; _provided_ , that with
respect to any Company RSU that constitutes deferred compensation subject to
409A of the Code and that is not permitted to be paid at the Effective Time
without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such
payment will be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable
Company Equity Plan and award agreement that will not trigger such Tax or
penalty.

(b) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company Board
and the Parent Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt any
resolutions it reasonably determines to be necessary to provide for the
treatment of the Company RSUs and Company Restricted Stock contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ and, not later than two (2) Business Days prior to
the Effective Time, ( _i_ ) the Company shall provide Parent with drafts of
any such resolutions it proposes to adopt for Parents reasonable review and
comment, which comments the Company shall consider in good faith, and ( _ii_ )
Parent shall provide the Company with drafts of any such resolutions it
proposes to adopt for the Companys reasonable review and comment, which
comments Parent shall consider in good faith.

Section 2.13 _Withholding_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
and any other applicable withholding agent, as applicable, shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any applicable provisions of
state, local or foreign Law; _provided_ , that withholding for Merger
Consideration received in respect of Company RSUs and Company Restricted
Stock shall be effected as cash and net share withholding in proportion to the
type of consideration (cash or Company Stock) payable to the holder of such
Company RSUs or share of Company Restricted Stock. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

Section 2.14 _Parent Corporate Matters_. Parent shall take all requisite
action to cause the Board of Directors of Parent to be as set forth on
_Exhibit_ __ _ B_ as of the Effective Time.

24  under the heading "Risk Factors" or disclosure set forth in any "forward
looking statements" disclaimer or other general statements to the extent they
are cautionary, predictive or forward looking in nature that are included in
any part of any Company SEC Document be deemed to be an exception to, or, as

on its business as now conducted and is duly qualified to do business as
a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary for the conduct of its business as presently
conducted, except where any failure to have such power or authority or to be
so qualified would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the

this Agreement, the Company has delivered or made available to Parent true and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company
as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

Section 3.2 _Corporate Authorization_.

deliver this Agreement and the KKR and DandO Voting Agreements, to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions

(collectively, the " _Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

(b) The Company Board has unanimously approved the Company Board Resolutions.

Section 3.3 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the KKR and DandO Voting Agreements by the Company and the

Company Stockholder Approval and the authorizations, consents and approvals

which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party or which is binding
upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their respective
properties or assets or any license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval
or other similar authorization affecting the Company and its Subsidiaries or
( _d_ ) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien, other than any
Permitted Lien, on any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except, in the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d),
as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.5  _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists solely of
1,000,000,000 shares of Company Stock and 300,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "). As of
the close of business on February 8, 2018, ( _i_ ) there were issued and
outstanding ( _A_ ) 97,727,755 shares of Company Stock (including 363,934
shares of Company Restricted Stock under the Company Equity Plan), ( _B_ ) no

other ownership interests in the Company or ( _iv_ ) restricted shares, stock
appreciation rights, performance units, restricted stock units, contingent

price of, any shares of capital stock or other voting securities of or other
ownership interests in the Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iv)
being referred to collectively as the " _Company Securities_ ").

(c) There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company
Securities. Other than the Stockholders Agreement, neither the Company nor any

All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly
authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable, are not
subject to any preemptive rights and were issued in compliance with
all applicable securities Laws. No Subsidiary of the Company owns any shares
of capital stock of the Company or any Company Securities. There are no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company
having the right to vote (whether on an as-converted basis or otherwise) (or
convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on
any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote.

 



26 Section 3.6 _Subsidiaries_.

 

(a) Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly incorporated or otherwise duly
organized, validly existing and (where such concept is recognized) in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization,
except, in the case of any such Subsidiary, where the failure to be so
incorporated, organized, existing or in good standing would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company has all corporate, limited
liability company or comparable powers required to carry on its business as
now conducted, except as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each such
Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign entity and (where
such concept is recognized) is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
it is required to be so qualified or in good standing, except where failure to
be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

(b) The outstanding capital stock or other voting securities of or other
ownership interests in each Subsidiary of the Company are owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company free and clear of any Lien other than Permitted
Liens. _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
complete and accurate list of the Subsidiaries of the Company, including, for
each of the Subsidiaries, ( _x_ ) its name and ( _y_ ) its jurisdiction of
organization. Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.6(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, each Subsidiary is directly or indirectly wholly owned by
the Company. There are no issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding ( _i_ )
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of or other ownership interests in any Subsidiary of the Company, (
_ii_ ) options or other rights or agreements, commitments or understandings to
acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other obligations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any shares of capital stock
or other voting securities of or other ownership interests in, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any shares of
capital stock or other voting securities of or other ownership interests in
any Subsidiary of the Company or ( _iii_ ) restricted shares, stock
appreciation rights, performance units, contingent value rights, "phantom"
stock or similar securities or rights issued or granted by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that are derivative of, or provide economic benefits
based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any capital stock or
other voting securities of or other ownership interests in any Subsidiary of
the Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iii) being referred to
collectively as the " _Company Subsidiary Securities_ "). There are no
outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Subsidiary
Securities.

Section 3.7 _SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act_.

(a) The Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC on a timely basis
(including following any extensions of time for filing provided by Rule
12b-25 promulgated under the Exchange Act) all reports, schedules, forms and
documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated
therein) required to be filed or furnished, as the case may be, by the
Company since December 31, 2015 (collectively, the " _Company SEC Documents_
"). As of its filing date (or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of
the most recent amendment or supplement and giving effect to such amendment
or supplement), each Company SEC Document complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
as the case may be, and none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15

(b) As of the date hereof, the Debt Letters are in full force and effect and
constitute the legal, valid, enforceable and binding obligations of Merger Sub
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject in each
case to the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date hereof, the Debt Letters
have not been amended, restated or otherwise modified in any respect (and no
amendment, restatement or modification is contemplated, except to add
purchasers, lenders or agents) and the commitments contained in the Debt
Letters have not been withdrawn, rescinded, modified or terminated in any
respect by Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto
(and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such withdrawal, rescission, modification

contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing

Contracts or arrangements related to the Debt Financing or the funding of all

Debt Letters (except for any engagement letters or fee discount letters
related to the Debt Financing). Assuming the conditions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 8.1_ and in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are satisfied at Closing and assuming
the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties in _Article III_
, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Debt Letters, the net
proceeds contemplated from the Debt Financing will, in the aggregate at and
as of the Closing Date along with all other funds available to Parent
including the Escrow Account, be sufficient for the satisfaction of all of
Parents payment obligations under this Agreement, including the payment
of the Merger Consideration and all fees and expenses reasonably expected to
be incurred in connection therewith or required to be paid by Parent
hereunder. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming the satisfaction of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and in _Section_
__ _ 8.2_ and assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties in _Article III_ , no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent under the Debt Letters
or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Debt Letters. As of the
date hereof, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and assuming the
accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties in _Article III_ ,

Financing contained in the Debt Letters, as the case may be, to be satisfied
by it will not be satisfied, nor does Parent have Knowledge, as of the date of
this Agreement, that the full amount of the Debt Financing will not be made
available to Parent and/or Merger Sub as of the time at which the Closing is

Closing (or earlier termination of this Agreement and satisfaction of any
obligations of Parent under _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ hereof) for use to satisfy
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement. The funds held
in the Escrow Account are sufficient to satisfy any reasonably anticipated
obligations of Parent under _Section_ __ _ 7.5(g)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_

Section 6.3 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each
former and present director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or

permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim

officer, director or other fiduciary of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or of any Person if such service was at the request of or for the benefit of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the fullest extent provided in
their respective certificates of incorporation, bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) or any indemnification agreement as in effect on the
date of this Agreement and made available by the Company to Parent prior to
the date of this Agreement. All rights to elimination of liability,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted
or

 



53  claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in effect as of the date
of this Agreement in favor of the Indemnified Parties shall survive the Merger
and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) honor all the terms thereof. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person
may seek indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall continue in effect with respect to such
matter until the final disposition of all claims relating thereto.

(b) For a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, Parent,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, shall cause to be
maintained in effect the provisions in the certificates of incorporation and
bylaws and comparable organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation
and each Subsidiary of the Company (or in such documents of any successor
thereto) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement
of expenses in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and, during such six year period, shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individual who immediately before the Effective Time was a
Indemnified Party, except as required by applicable Law.

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, either ( _i_ )
continue to maintain in effect for a period of no less than six years after
the Effective Time the directors and officers insurance policies (the " _D
andO Insurance_") maintained by the Company and in place as of the date of this
Agreement or ( _ii_ ) purchase comparable DandO Insurance (from a carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys DandO Insurance carrier) for
such six-year period, in each case, with coverage for the persons who are
covered by such existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as such
existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to
the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the
Company paid in its last full fiscal year (the " _Premium Cap_ "); _provided_
, _further_ , that if the amount necessary to procure such insurance coverage
exceeds the Premium Cap, the Company may purchase the most advantageous
policy available for an amount not to exceed the Premium Cap. At the Companys
option or at Parents request, the Company may purchase, prior to the
Effective Time, a prepaid "tail policy" for a period of no more than six
years after the Effective Time with coverage for the persons who are covered
by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions
and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals
as such existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring
prior to the Effective Time, in which event Parent shall cease to have any
obligations under the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_; 
_provided_ that the aggregate premium for such policies shall not exceed the
Premium Cap; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the amount of annual premiums
necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Premium
Cap, the Company may procure and maintain for such six-year period the most
advantageous policy available for an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap.
In the event the Company elects to purchase such a "tail policy," the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such "tail
policy" in full force and effect for a period of no less than six years after
the Effective Time and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

(d) No Indemnified Party shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to any claim for which indemnification is sought by
an Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ (an "
_Indemnification Claim_ ") without the prior written consent of Parent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each of Parent and the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any Indemnification Claim and will
provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 

(e) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns ( _i_ ) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or

 



54  entity of such consolidation or merger or ( _ii_ ) transfers or conveys all
or substantially all of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to succeed to or
assume its obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ shall survive consummation of
the Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Parties and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by Contract, at Law or otherwise.

 

Section 6.4 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing thereafter for
twelve months or, if shorter, during the period of employment for an employee
of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to provide, to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who continue employment with
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation,
following the Closing (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (
_1_ ) base wage or annual base salary levels that are no less favorable than
those in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, ( _2_ ) short term
and long term incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable
in the aggregate than those in effect for such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, ( _3_ ) employee benefits (excluding
compensation and benefits covered by clauses (2) and (4) of this _Section_ __
_ 6.4_, benefits under a defined benefit pension plan and equity or equity-
based compensation, other than benefits under the NSM Private Services Limited
Provident Fund with respect to Continuing Employees who participate in such
plan as of the date of this Agreement) that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time and ( _4_ ) severance benefits that are no less favorable
than those provided pursuant to the applicable Company Plans set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 3.18(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by Parent and its respective Affiliates
in which Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing
(the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall be credited
with the same amount of service as was credited by the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time under similar or comparable Company Plans in which
such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except ( _x_ ) for purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit plans
(other than under the NSM Private Services Limited Provident Fund with respect
to Continuing Employees who participate in such plan as of the date of this
Agreement) or benefit levels under retiree welfare plans and ( _y_ ) to the
extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits). In addition,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall: ( _i_ ) with
respect to any New Benefit Plans in which the Continuing Employees may be
eligible to participate following the Closing, cause each Continuing Employee
to be immediately eligible to participate in such New Benefit Plans, without
any waiting time, to the extent coverage under such New Benefit Plans replaces
coverage under a similar or comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing
Employee was eligible to participate immediately before such commencement of
participation and ( _ii_ ) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause, for
purposes of each New Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Benefit Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to
the extent any such exclusions or requirements were waived or were
inapplicable under any similar or comparable Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing. Parent
shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Company
Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employees participation in the
corresponding New Benefit Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Benefit Plan.

  



55 (c) Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby will constitute a "change in control"
or "change of control" (or other similar phrase) for purposes of each Company
Plan listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

(d) Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to honor in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
Company Plans set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted
by such plans, agreements or written arrangements consistent with the terms
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_.

(e) The terms of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ are included for the sole benefit
of the Parties and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Continuing
Employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any
participant or beneficiary in any Company Plan or any other Person or
Governmental Authority (whether as a third party beneficiary or otherwise)
other than the Parties hereto. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall ( _i_
) constitute or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any Company Plan
or other compensation or benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement, ( _ii_
) obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to ( _x_ ) maintain any
particular benefit plan or arrangement or ( _y_ ) retain the employment of
any particular employee or ( _iii_ ) prevent the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any benefit plan or
arrangement.

a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, ( _iii_ ) consult with each other prior to taking any
material position with respect to the filings under the HSR Act or in
discussions with or filings to be submitted to any other Governmental
Authority, ( _iv_ ) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other (to the extent timely
communicated) in connection with, any analyses, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be submitted to any Governmental
Authority and ( _v_ ) coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging
such information and promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies
of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral
presentations) made by such Party with any Governmental Authority relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including under the
HSR Act, _provided_ , however, that materials may be redacted or provided on
an outside counsel only basis as necessary to address reasonable privilege or
confidentiality concerns (including with respect to other businesses of the
Parent, its Subsidiaries and any other Affiliates or stockholders of Parent or
the Company), and to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, or Parent and its Subsidiaries, and other competitively
sensitive material.

(d) Unless prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the
applicable Governmental Authority, each of the Company and Parent, including,
as necessary, the respective Affiliates of each, shall ( _i_ ) to the extent
reasonably practicable, not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in
any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of
the Merger (including with respect to any of the actions referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_) without the other, ( _ii_ ) to the extent reasonably
practicable, give the other reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or
conversation and ( _iii_ ) in the event one such Party is prohibited by
applicable Law or Order or by the applicable Governmental Authority from
participating or attending any such meeting or engaging in any such
conversation, keep the non-participating Party reasonably apprised with
respect thereto.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent and the
Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned, any decree, judgment,
injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) To the extent that any consent, approval or waiver of a Third Party (other
than any Governmental Authority) is required with respect to any Contract in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this

 



57  Agreement (each, a " _Third Party Consent_ "), the Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
obtain such Third Party Consent as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Company to make any payment or deliver anything of value to any Third Party in
order to obtain any Third Party Consent. Parent shall reasonably cooperate
with the Company in connection with obtaining such Third Party Consents,
including by making its Representatives reasonably available to meet with such
Third Parties by telephone or in person during normal business hours as
reasonably requested by the Company, and shall reasonably cooperate to provide
such documentation or information as is required by any such Third Parties as
promptly as practicable.

 

Section 7.2 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders  Meetings_.

 

(a) All filings by the Company or Parent with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and all mailings to the stockholders of the
Company in connection with the Merger or to the stockholders of Parent in
connection with the Parent Share Issuance shall be subject to the prior review
and comment by the other Party.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in
any event within twenty-five (25) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare, and Parent shall
cause to be filed with the SEC, the Registration Statement, in which a joint
proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of Parent and the stockholders
of the Company relating to the Parent Meeting and the Company Meeting,
respectively (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") will be included. Each of Parent and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement and the
Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC, to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning it as may reasonably be requested by the other Party in
connection with such actions and the preparation of the Proxy Statement and
the Registration Statement. Promptly after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act, the Company will cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to stockholders of the Company, and Parent will cause
the Proxy Statement to be mailed to stockholders of Parent.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall ( _i_ ) as promptly as practicable
notify the other of ( _1_ ) the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff and all other written correspondence and oral communications with the
SEC relating to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement (including
the time when the Registration Statement becomes effective and the issuance of
any stop order or suspension of qualifications relating to the Registration
Statement) and ( _2_ ) any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or for
additional information with respect thereto, and ( _ii_ ) provide the other
with copies of ( _1_ ) all correspondence between it and its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to the
Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and ( _2_ ) all Orders of the SEC relating to the Registration
Statement. Each of Parent and the Company shall ensure that none of the
information supplied by or on its behalf for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in ( _A_ ) the Registration Statement will, at the time
the Registration Statement is filed with the SEC, at each time at which it is
amended and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading and ( _B_
) the Proxy Statement will, on the date on which it is first mailed to the
stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of Parent and at the time of
each of the Company Meeting and the Parent Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Each of Parent
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond (with the
assistance of, and after consultation with, the other as provided by this
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_) as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time, any information 

 



58  relating to the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates
(including with respect to Parent, solely for this purpose, KKR), officers or
directors is discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Registration
Statement, so that neither the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement
would contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties thereof, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company
and Parent.

 

(d) The Company will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date the
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Companys stockholders for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_
"). The Company will, subject to compliance with the DGCL and the Exchange
Act, use its reasonable best efforts to ( _i_ ) hold the Company Meeting as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act and ( _ii_ ) subject to  _Section_ __ _
7.3(e)_, solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. The
Company will include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement,
except to the extent that the Company Board shall have made a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)_, if on a date for
which the Company Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Stock to obtain the
Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, or if the
Parent has provided consent, the Company will have the right to make one or
more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Meeting, provided
that the Company Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more
than 30 days after the date for which the Company Meeting was
originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by
applicable Law). The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, its obligations pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ will not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Company Acquisition Proposal, by the making of any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change by the Company Board or the occurrence of a Company
Intervening Event.

(e) Parent will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of Parents stockholders for the purpose
of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval (the " _Parent Meeting_ ").
Parent will, subject to compliance with the DGCL and the Exchange Act, use
its reasonable best efforts to ( _i_ ) hold the Parent Meeting as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act and ( _ii_ ) subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_,
solicit proxies in favor of the Parent Share Issuance. Parent will include the
Parent Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, except to the extent that
the Parent Board shall have made a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change as
permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 7.2(e)_, if on a date for which the Parent Meeting is
scheduled, Parent has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain the Parent Stockholder Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present, or if the Company has provided consent,
Parent will have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Parent Meeting, provided that the Parent Meeting is not
postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for
which the Parent Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments
or postponements required by applicable Law). Parent agrees that, unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, its
obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ will not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Parent of
any Parent Acquisition Proposal, by the making of any Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change by the Parent Board or the occurrence of a Parent
Intervening Event.

(f) The Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to hold the
Company Meeting and the Parent Meeting on the same day at the same time.

 



59 Section 7.3 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_ , and except as otherwise specifically provided for in this
Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and
shall not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, employees
or Representatives to, directly or indirectly, ( _i_ ) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer
which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company
Acquisition Proposal, ( _ii_ ) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives) any nonpublic information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, in connection with any Company Acquisition
Proposal or, subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_, effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, ( _iii_ ) approve or recommend, or make any public
statement approving or recommending, a Company Acquisition Proposal, ( _iv_ )
enter into any letter of intent, merger agreement or other similar agreement
providing for a Company Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) (each an " _Alternative Company Acquisition
Agreement_ "), ( _v_ ) submit any Company Acquisition Proposal to a vote of
the stockholders of the Company or ( _vi_ ) resolve or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_, if,
prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company
receives an unsolicited bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, ( _i_ ) is or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Company Proposal and ( _ii_
) failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company
may, in response to such Company Acquisition Proposal, furnish nonpublic
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person or
group (or any of their Representatives) making such Company Acquisition
Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group
and their Representatives regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that ( _x_ ) prior to furnishing any nonpublic
information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person or
group or their respective Representatives, the Company enters into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group making such
Company Acquisition Proposal and ( _y_ ) promptly (but not more than 48
hours) after furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person, the
Company furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such
nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished to Parent or its
Representatives). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Companys Representatives
may in any event ( _A_ ) seek to clarify the terms and conditions of any
Company Acquisition Proposal solely to determine whether such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Company Proposal and ( _B_ ) inform a Person or group that has made
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is considering making, a Company
Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) notify
Parent after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries by any Person who has made or would reasonably be
expected to make a Company Acquisition Proposal and provide to Parent copies
of all material correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to such Company Acquisition
Proposal or such inquiry or proposal. Such notice shall indicate the identity
of the Person making the proposal or offer, the material terms and conditions
of any such proposal or offer and any related financing and, if applicable,
the nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request.
Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt
basis (and in any event within 48 hours), regarding any material changes to
the status and material terms of any such proposal or offer (including any
material amendments thereto or any material change to the scope or material
terms or conditions thereof), and provide to Parent copies of all material
correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to such proposal or offer.

 



60 (d) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall
direct its Representatives to, immediately ( _i_ ) cease any existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to a Company
Acquisition Proposal, ( _ii_ ) terminate access for any Person (other than
Parent, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives) to any data room
and ( _iii_ ) request the return or destruction of any non-public information
provided to any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives) in connection with a potential Company
Acquisition Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the
time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and, in the case of a Company
Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited after the date of this Agreement
and that did not result from a material breach of _Section_ __ _ 7.3(d)_,
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(iii)_ and
concurrently pay the fees required by  _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ in order to enter
into a definitive agreement in connection with a Superior Company Proposal)
if: ( _i_ ) ( _A_ ) a Company Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company
after the date of this Agreement and such Company Acquisition Proposal is not
withdrawn prior to such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or ( _B_ ) there
has been a Company Intervening Event; ( _ii_ ) in the case of a Company
Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Company
Proposal; and ( _iii_ ) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

 

(f) Prior to making any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into
any Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement, ( _i_ ) the Company Board
shall provide Parent at least four Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action, which notice shall specify, in reasonable
detail, the identity of the Person making the proposal or offer, the reasons
therefor and, in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such proposal, including a copy of any proposed
definitive agreement; ( _ii_ ) during the four Business Days following
such written notice, the Company Board and its Representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated hereby proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Company
Proposal or Company Intervening Event, as applicable; and ( _iii_ ) at the end
of the four Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii), the
Company Board shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors (and taking
into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent), that, as applicable ( _A_ ) the Company
Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Company Proposal or ( _B_ )
the Company Intervening Event continues to warrant a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and, in each case, that failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Laws. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_
shall also apply to any change to the financial or other material terms of a
proposal that was previously the subject of a notice under this _Section_ __ _
7.3(f)_, and any such change shall require a new notice to Parent as described
above, except that all references in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_ to four
Business Days shall be deemed to be three Business Days.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated
by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(g)_
shall not permit the Company Board to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change except to the extent otherwise permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_;
_provided_ , _further_ , that a request by Parent for the Company to publicly
recommend against a Company Acquisition Proposal may not be made more than
once with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal unless such Company
Acquisition Proposal is subsequently materially amended or modified, in which
case Parent may make one request each time such Company Acquisition Proposal
is so subsequently materially amended or modified. For the avoidance of doubt,
any "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not constitute
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



61 Section 7.4 _No Solicitation by Parent_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_ , and except as otherwise specifically provided for in this
Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and
shall not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, employees
or Representatives to, directly or indirectly, ( _i_ ) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer
which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, ( _ii_ ) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives) any nonpublic information relating to Parent
and its Subsidiaries, in connection with any Parent Acquisition Proposal or,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.4(c)_, effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change, ( _iii_ ) approve or recommend, or make any public statement approving
or recommending, a Parent Acquisition Proposal, ( _iv_ ) enter into any
letter of intent, merger agreement or other similar agreement providing for a
Parent Acquisition Proposal, ( _v_ ) submit any Parent Acquisition Proposal to
a vote of the stockholders of Parent or ( _vi_ ) resolve or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall
direct its Representatives to, immediately ( _i_ ) cease any existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, ( _ii_ ) terminate access for any Person (other than
the Company, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives) to any data
room and ( _iii_ ) request the return or destruction of any non-public
information provided to any Person (other than the Company, its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives) in connection with a potential Parent
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the
time the Parent Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Parent Board may effect
a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change if there has been a Parent Intervening
Event.

(d) Prior to making any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, ( _i_ ) the
Parent Board shall provide the Company at least four Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
specify, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor; ( _ii_ ) during the four
Business Days following such written notice, the Parent Board and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with the Company (to the extent
the Company desires to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated hereby proposed by the Company in response to such
Parent Intervening Event, as applicable; and ( _iii_ ) at the end of the four
Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Parent Board
shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with Parents outside
legal counsel and outside financial advisors (and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing
by the Company), that the Parent Intervening Event continues to warrant a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change and, in each case, that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Parent Board from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated
by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 7.4(e)_ shall
not permit the Parent Board to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
except to the extent otherwise permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_;
_provided_ , _further_ , that a request by the Company for Parent to
publicly recommend against a Parent Acquisition Proposal may not be made more
than once with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal unless such Parent
Acquisition Proposal is subsequently materially amended or modified, in which
case the Company may make one request each time such Parent Acquisition
Proposal is so subsequently materially amended or modified. For the avoidance
of doubt, any "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not
constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



62 Section 7.5 _Financing_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, obtain and consummate the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Letters, no later
than the time at which the Closing is required to occur pursuant to
_Section _ _2.2_ ), including using their reasonable best efforts to ( _i_ )
( _A_ ) maintain in effect the Debt Letters and comply with all of their
respective obligations thereunder to the extent that the failure to comply
would adversely impact the amount or timing of Debt Financing (taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) or the availability of
the Debt Financing at Closing, ( _B_ ) negotiate, enter into and, assuming all
conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ hereof have been satisfied,
deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing reflecting
the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Letters or on other terms that
( _1_ ) are acceptable to Parent and Merger Sub in their sole discretion, (
_2_ ) would not reasonably be expected to delay (taking into account the
expected timing of the Marketing Period) or adversely affect the ability of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
( _3_ ) would otherwise not be prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 7.5(c)_, so that
such agreements are in effect no later than the time at which the Closing is
required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and ( _C_ ) enforce their
rights under the Debt Letters to the extent that the failure to enforce would
adversely impact the amount or timing of Debt Financing (taking into account
the expected timing of the Marketing Period) or the availability of the Debt
Financing at Closing and ( _ii_ ) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) (or obtain the waiver of)
all the conditions to the Debt Financing and the definitive agreements
related thereto that are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub and in their
control. In the event that ( _x_ ) all conditions set forth in _Article VIII_
have been satisfied or waived or, upon funding shall be satisfied or waived,
and ( _y_ ) the conditions to the Debt Financing have been satisfied or
waived, or, upon funding shall be satisfied or waived, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Persons providing the
Debt Financing (the " _Debt Financing Parties_ ") to fund the Debt Financing
at Closing.

 

(b) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current
basis of any material developments concerning the status of the Debt
Financing which could reasonably be expected to impact the availability of the
Debt Financing and upon the Companys reasonable written request, provide the
Company with copies of executed material definitive agreements related to the
Debt Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall promptly (and in
no event less than one Business Day) after obtaining knowledge thereof, give
the Company written notice of any ( _i_ ) breach or default by Parent, its
Affiliates, any Debt Financing Party or any other party to the Debt Letters
or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing (or any event or
circumstance, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would give rise
to any breach or default) if such breach or default could reasonably be
expect to result in a delay of, or in any way limit, the availability of the
Debt Financing, ( _ii_ ) receipt by Parent of any written notice or other
written communication from any Debt Financing Parties with respect to
threatened or actual withdrawal, repudiation, expiration, intention not to
fund under or termination of the Debt Letters or the Debt Financing, ( _iii_ )
receipt by Parent of any written notice or other written communication from
any Debt Financing Parties with respect to material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to the Debt Letters or any definitive document
related to the Debt Financing (other than ordinary course negotiations)
with respect to the obligation to provide the Debt Financing or the amount of
the Debt Financing to be funded at Closing, in each case, that could
reasonably be expected to make the funding of the Debt Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely
to occur or delay the availability of the Debt Financing or ( _iv_ ) if for
any reason Parent in good faith believes that there is a material possibility
that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing
needed to consummate the Merger at the Effective Time; _provided_ , that in no
event will Parent be under any obligation to provide any information shared
among Parent, Merger Sub and their professional advisors in connection with
matters contemplated by the foregoing that is subject to attorney-client or
other privilege if Parent and Merger Sub shall have used their reasonable best
efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive
such privilege.

 



63 (c) Parent may amend, supplement, modify, terminate, assign or agree to any
waiver under the Debt Letters without the prior written approval of the
Company, _provided_ that Parent shall not, without Companys prior written
consent, permit any amendment, modification, assignment, termination or
material waiver to be made to, or consent to or agree to any waiver of, any
provision of or remedy under the Debt Letters which would ( _A_ ) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by increasing the amount of
fees to be paid or original issue discount (except as set forth in any
"market flex" provisions contemplated by the fee letter)) to an amount less
than the amount required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
( _B_ ) impose new or additional conditions to the Debt Financing or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the Debt Financing,
in each case, in a manner that would or would reasonably be expected to ( _I_
) delay, prevent or make less likely the consummation of the Merger or the
funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt
Financing) at the Effective Time (taking into account the expected timing of
the Marketing Period) (it being understood and agreed that, in any event,
Parent may amend the Debt Letters to add additional Financing Sources), (
_II_ ) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against
the Debt Financing Parties or any other parties to the Debt Letters or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto or ( _III_ ) adversely affect the
ability of Parent to timely consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. In the event that new commitment letters and/or fee
letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification of the Debt Letters permitted pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.5_, such new commitment letters and/or fee letters
shall be deemed to be a part of the "Debt Financing" and deemed to be the
"Debt Letters" for all purposes of this Agreement. Parent shall promptly (and
in any event no later than one Business Day) deliver to the Company true,
correct and complete copies of any termination, amendment, modification or
replacement of the Debt Letters.

(d) If funds in the amounts set forth in the Debt Letters, or any
portion thereof, become unavailable on the terms and conditions (including
any "market flex" provisions applicable thereto) contemplated in the Debt
Letters, Parent and Merger Sub shall, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event (taking into account the Marketing Period), ( _x_ )
notify the Company in writing thereof, ( _y_ ) use their respective reasonable
best efforts to obtain substitute financing, including from alternative
sources, in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the Debt
Financing that is available and any cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries

together, the " _Conditions_ "), and the parties shall use their reasonable
best efforts to cause the Offers to close on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
that the consummation of an Offer with respect to any series of Company Notes
shall not be a condition to Closing. The Offers shall be conducted in
compliance with any applicable provisions of the applicable indenture and with
applicable Law, including SEC rules and regulations, and the Company shall
not be required to commence and conduct any Offer that is not in compliance
with the applicable indenture and applicable Laws. The Company shall waive any

efforts to enter into customary agreements with such parties, with terms
to be agreed by Parent, and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to

and any related consent payments to the extent required pursuant to the terms
of any applicable Offer. The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and any Representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best efforts,
at Parents sole expense as contemplated by clause (c) below, to provide all
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with any Offer. To

series of Company Notes and the applicable indenture, to ( _x_ ) issue a
notice of redemption for all of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of
such series of Company Notes, pursuant to the redemption provisions of the
applicable indenture, which notice of redemption shall be issued at or after
the Effective Time and ( _y_ ) take any other actions prior to the Effective
Time reasonably requested by Parent to facilitate the redemption and
satisfaction and discharge of such series of Company Notes and the
related indenture immediately following the Effective Time pursuant to the
redemption and the satisfaction and discharge provisions of the applicable

 



67  indenture and the other provisions of such indenture applicable thereto;
_provided_ , that prior to the Company being required under clause (x) above
to issue any notice of redemption, Parent shall have, or shall have caused to

legal counsel of legal opinions, to the trustee as reasonably requested by the
trustee in connection therewith. The Company shall also use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the trustee for each series of Company Notes to
cooperate with Parent to facilitate each Discharge.

for ( _i_ ) all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable outside attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by the

access to any such properties or information, ( _ii_ ) the information is
subject to confidentiality obligations to a Third Party, ( _iii_ ) disclosure

71 (b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent and Merger
Sub shall have performed in all material respects their covenants and
obligations under the Agreement required to be performed by them at or prior
to the Closing.

 

(c) _Parent Certificate_. Parent shall have delivered to the Company a
certificate signed by an executive officer of Parent certifying on behalf of
Parent, and not in such officers personal capacity, that the conditions set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ have been
satisfied.

 

(d) _Tax Opinion_. The Company shall have received a copy of a written opinion
of BDO (" _Parent_ __ _s Tax Advisor_ "), dated as of the Closing Date, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that
(based on the most current information available prior to the Closing Date as
provided by Parent to BDO and subject to customary assumptions and
qualifications) ( _i_ ) there should not have been an Ownership Change since
March 19, 2012, and ( _ii_ ) the Merger, taken together with the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and occurring on the Closing
Date, should not result in an Ownership Change (the " _382 Tax Opinion_ "). In
rendering the 382 Tax Opinion, Parents Tax Advisor shall be entitled to
receive and rely upon tax representation letters, including from Parent.

TERMINATION

Section 9.1  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Effective Time (except as otherwise stated below):

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

 

(i) if the Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before November 12,
2018 (the " _End Date_ ");  _provided_ that such period may be extended by
the Company or Parent upon written notice for one or more 30-day periods, not
to exceed 90 days in the aggregate, to the extent all closing conditions
herein are capable of being satisfied as of such time other than the
condition regarding receipt of the consents, notices and approvals, as
applicable, from the Governmental Authorities set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.1(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_
shall not be available to a Party if the failure of the Effective Time to
occur before the End Date was primarily due to such Partys breach of any of
its obligations under this Agreement;

(ii) if there shall have been issued an Order by a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction permanently prohibiting the consummation of the Merger
and such Order shall have become final and non-appealable;  _provided_ that
the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _
9.1(b)(ii)_ shall have used its reasonable best efforts to have such Order
lifted;

 

(iii) if the Company Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements
thereof) shall have concluded following the taking of a vote to approve the
Merger and the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained; or

(iv) if the Parent Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements
thereof) shall have concluded following the taking of a vote to approve the
Parent Share Issuance and the Parent Stockholder Approval shall not have been
obtained.

 

(c) by Parent:

 

(i) if a Parent Triggering Event shall have occurred; or

 

(ii) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its ( _A_
) representations or warranties or ( _B_ ) covenants or agreements set forth
in this Agreement, in each case which breach or failure to perform

 



72  ( _x_ ) would give rise to the failure of a condition to the Merger set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ and ( _y_ ) is
incapable of being cured by the Company during the 30-day period after written
notice from Parent of such breach or failure to perform, or, if capable of
being cured during such 30-day period, shall not have been cured by the
earlier of the end of such 30-day period and the End Date; _provided_ that if
such breach or failure to perform is capable of being cured by the Company
and the Company ceases using reasonable best efforts to cure such breach or
failure to perform following written notice from Parent, Parent shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
9.1(c)(ii)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_ if
Parent or Merger Sub is then in breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements such that the Company has the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(ii)_.

 

(d) by the Company:

 

(i) if a Company Triggering Event shall have occurred;

 

(ii) if Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its ( _A_ ) representations or warranties or ( _B_ ) covenants or agreements
set forth in this Agreement, in each case which breach or failure to perform (
_x_ ) would give rise to the failure of a condition to the Merger set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ and ( _y_ ) is incapable
of being cured by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, during the 30-day
period after written notice from the Company of such breach or failure to
perform, or, if capable of being cured during such 30-day period, shall not
have been cured by the earlier of the end of such 30-day period and the
End Date; _provided_ that if such breach or failure to perform is capable of
being cured by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, and Parent or Merger Sub,
as applicable, ceases using reasonable best efforts to cure such breach or
failure to perform following written notice from the Company, the Company
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 9.1(d)(ii)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
9.1(d)(ii)_ if the Company is then in breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements such that Parent has the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_;

(iii) if ( _A_ ) the Company Board authorizes the Company to enter into an
Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Company
Proposal to the extent permitted by, and subject to the terms and conditions
of, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, ( _B_ ) substantially concurrent with the
termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into an Alternative Company
Acquisition Agreement that constituted a Superior Company Proposal and ( _C_ )
prior to or concurrently with such termination, the Company pays to Parent in
immediately available funds any fees required to be paid pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.3_; or

 

(iv) if ( _A_ ) all of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ have been
satisfied or waived (except for any conditions that by their nature can only
be satisfied or waived on the Closing Date, but subject to such conditions
being able to be satisfied or waived at the time of termination), ( _B_ )
Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger within three Business
Days following the first date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_ and ( _C_ ) the Company shall have irrevocably notified
Parent in writing that it stood ready, willing and able to consummate the
Merger at such time.

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in _Section_ __ _
9.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating Party
to the other Party specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made. In the event of the termination of this Agreement
in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1_, this Agreement shall be terminated
and this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without
any liability or obligation on the part of any Party (or any stockholder,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative of such
Party), other than the Confidentiality Agreements, _Section_ __ _ 7.5(g)_, 
_Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_, this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, and
_Article X_ , which provisions shall survive such termination; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, without limiting _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ and subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.3(h)_, nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 9.2_ shall relieve any Party from liability for any Willful Breach of, or
actual fraud in connection with, this Agreement prior to such termination or
the requirement to make the payments set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.3_. No
termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the Parties
contained in the Confidentiality Agreements.

 



73 Section 9.3 _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(_ _i_ _)_ or in the event that this Agreement is

in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(iii)_ or as
promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two Business Days
following such termination) in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.1(c)(_ _i_ _)_.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ , then Parent shall pay to the
Company (or its designee), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, a
fee in the amount of $65,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") as
promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two Business Days following
such termination).

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ or _Section_ __ _
9.1(b)(iii)_, or in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)(ii)_ in respect of a Willful Breach of
this Agreement by the Company, and in each case ( _i_ ) at any time after the
date of this Agreement and prior to such termination of this Agreement, a
Company Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company or publicly
announced (whether or not withdrawn) and ( _ii_ ) within twelve (12) months
after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or a Company Acquisition Proposal
is consummated (in each case whether or not the same Company Acquisition
Proposal as that referred to above), then, in such event, the Company shall
pay to Parent (or its designee), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the Company Termination Fee within two Business Days following the
earlier of the date of the execution of such definitive agreement or the
consummation of such transaction; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes
of the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" in this _Section_ __ _
9.3(c)_, references to "15%" and "85%" shall be replaced by "50%".

 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(ii)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)(iv)_, then, in each
case, Parent shall pay to the Company (or its designee), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, a fee in the amount of $125,000,000 (the "

within two Business Days following such termination).

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b_ _)(_ _iv)_ , then Parent shall pay to the
Company (or its designee), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an
amount equal to $29,385,000 as compensation for the Companys Expenses as
promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two Business Days following
such termination), and if:

 

( _x_ ) ( _i_ ) at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to such
termination of this Agreement, a Parent Acquisition Proposal has been made to
or by Parent or publicly announced (whether or not withdrawn) and ( _ii_ )
within twelve (12) months after such termination, Parent enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal or a
Parent Acquisition Proposal is consummated (in each case whether or not the
same Parent Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then, in such
event, Parent shall pay to the Company (or its designee), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the Parent Termination Fee, less the amount of
the Companys Expenses to the extent previously paid by Parent pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(e)_, within two Business Days following the earlier
of the date of the execution of such definitive agreement or the consummation
of such transaction, or

 

( _y_ ) clause (x) of this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(e)_ does not apply (i.e.,
because no Parent Acquisition Proposal was made to or by Parent or publicly
announced (whether or not withdrawn) prior to such termination of this
Agreement), and, within twelve (12) months after such termination, Parent
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Parent Acquisition
Proposal or a Parent Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated, then,
in such event, Parent shall pay to the Company (or its designee), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an additional amount equal
to $18,615,000 within two Business Days

 



74  following the earlier of the date of the execution of such definitive
agreement or the consummation of such transaction.

 

(f) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ and ( _i_ ) at any time after
the date of this Agreement and prior to such termination of this Agreement, a
Parent Acquisition Proposal has been made to or by Parent or
publicly announced (whether or not withdrawn) and ( _ii_ ) within twelve (12)
months after such termination, Parent enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal or a Parent Acquisition Proposal is
consummated (in each case whether or not the same Parent Acquisition Proposal
as that referred to above), then, in such event, Parent shall pay to the
Company (or its designee), by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
the Parent Termination Fee, within two Business Days following the earlier of
the date of the execution of such definitive agreement or the consummation of
such transaction.

 

(g) The Parties acknowledge that ( _i_ ) the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, ( _ii_ ) each of the Company Termination Fee, the Parent
Termination Fee, any amounts payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(e)_ and
the Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and ( _iii_ )
that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, and, in order
to obtain such payment, the other Party commences a suit that results in a
judgment against such Party for any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
9.3_, then such Party shall pay the other Party its reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ from the date such payment was
required to be made until the date of payment at the annual rate equal to the
prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made (or such lesser rate as is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law). All payments under this _Section_ __ _
9.3_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in writing by Parent or the Company, as applicable. In no
event shall ( _x_ ) a Company Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee be
payable more than once and ( _y_ ) the Company receive more than one of the
Parent Termination Fee, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.3(e)_ and the Reverse Termination Fee.

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 10.12_, ( _i_ ) in the event that this Agreement is terminated
under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, the payment of the Company Termination Fee (plus
any costs, expenses or interest, if any, payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.3(g)_) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub
against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates or
Representatives (the " _Company Related Parties_ ") for all losses
and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to
perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (including as may arise out of the Voting Agreements), ( _ii_ ) in the
event that this Agreement is terminated under circumstances where the Parent
Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, the payment
of the Parent Termination Fee (plus any costs, expenses or interest payable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(g)_ or any losses or damages payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(g)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_) shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company against the Parent Related Parties
for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach
or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount,
none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including as may arise out of the Voting Agreements) and
( _iii_ ) in the event that this

 



75  Agreement is terminated under circumstances where the Reverse Termination
Fee is payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, subject to  _Section_
__ _ 10.12_, the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee (plus any costs,
expenses or interest, if any, payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(g)_ or
any losses or damages payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.5(g)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company
and its Subsidiaries against Parent, Merger Sub, the Financing Sources or any
of their respective Non-Recourse Parties (collectively, the " _Parent Related
Parties_ ") for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder (including any Willful Breach of this
Agreement) or otherwise in respect of this Agreement or any oral
representation made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, and upon
payment of such amount, none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby (including as may arise out of the
Voting Agreements).

 

(i) Other than seeking to terminate this Agreement and receive ( _x_ ) payment
of ( _A_ ) the Parent Termination Fee, ( _B_ ) the Reverse Termination Fee, (
_C_ ) the amounts payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(e)_ and/or ( _D_ )
Expenses, in each case, plus any costs, expenses or interest payable pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 9.3(g)_ and in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_,
or ( _y_ ) indemnification for any losses or damages payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.5(g)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries nor any other Company Related Party shall seek to recover any
other damages or seek any other remedy, whether based on a claim at law or in
equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, with respect to any losses or damages
suffered in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or any oral representation made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. In no event shall Parent be subject to (nor shall any Company
Related Party seek to recover) monetary damages in excess of an amount equal
to the Reverse Termination Fee (plus any costs, expenses or interest, if any,
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3(g)_ or any losses or damages payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(g)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.6(c)_), in the
aggregate, for any losses or other liabilities arising out of or in connection
with breaches by Parent of its representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement (whether willful, intentional,
unilateral or otherwise, including Willful Breach) or arising from any claim
or cause of action that any Company Related Party may have hereunder,
including for a breach of _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ as a result of the Debt
Financing not being available to be drawn down or otherwise arising from the
Debt Letters or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be
made in connection herewith or therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, while
the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance and the payment of
one of the Parent Termination Fee, the amounts payable pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 9.3(e)_, or the Reverse Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall
the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance or other equitable relief and the payment of the
Parent Termination Fee, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.3(e)_ and/or the Reverse Termination Fee.

ARTICLE X 

_Miscellaneous_

 

Section 10.1 _No Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations, warranties covenants and agreements in this Agreement, or in
any schedule, certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, shall survive the Effective Time or, except as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.1_, as the case may be. This _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ shall not limit any
covenant or agreement of the Parties which by its terms contemplates
performance after the Effective Time.

 

Section 10.2 _Amendment and Modification_. Subject to applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in any and all respects by
written agreement of Parent and the Company at any time prior to the Effective
Time with respect to any of the terms contained herein; _provided_ that after
the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained or the Parent Stockholder
Approval is obtained, no amendment that requires further approval of the
stockholders of the Company (in the case of the Company Stockholder Approval)
or the stockholders of Parent (in the case of the Parent Stockholder
Approval), in each case under applicable Law, shall

 



76  be made without such required further approval; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that _Section_ __ _ 9.3_, this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_,  _Section_ __ _
10.8_, _Section_ __ _ 10.11_, _Section_ __ _ 10.12(c)_, _Section_ __ _
10.13_ and _Section_ __ _ 10.14_ shall not be amended in any manner adverse
in any material respect to the Debt Financing Parties without the prior
written consent of the Financing Sources. A termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ or an amendment or waiver of this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.3_
shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company, action by their respective board of directors (or
a committee thereof).

Section 10.3 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, Parent or Merger Sub on the one hand, or the
Company on the other hand, may ( _a_ ) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, ( _b_ ) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement of the other
Parties or ( _c_ ) subject to the second proviso of the first sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 10.2_, waive compliance by the other Parties with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single or partial
exercise by any Party of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any
other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this
Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Parent shall act on behalf
of Merger Sub and the Company may rely on any notice given by Parent
on behalf of Merger Sub with respect to the matters set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_.

Section 10.4  _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided herein and as set
forth on Section 1.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring such cost or expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall
pay any and all fees and expenses, other than the Companys attorneys fees,
incurred in connection with the filing by the Parties of the premerger
notification and report forms relating to the Merger under the HSR Act.

Section 10.5 _Disclosure Letter References_. All capitalized terms not defined
in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter (as applicable,
the " _Disclosure Letter_ ") shall have the meanings assigned to them in this
Agreement. The Disclosure Letter shall, for all purposes in this Agreement, be
arranged in numbered and lettered parts and subparts corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections and subsections contained in this Agreement.
Each item disclosed in the Disclosure Letter shall constitute an exception to
or, as applicable, disclosure for the purposes of, the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) to which it makes express reference
and shall also be deemed to be disclosed or set forth for the purposes of
every other part in the Disclosure Letter relating to the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) set forth in this Agreement to the
extent a cross-reference within the Disclosure Letter is expressly made to
such other part in the Disclosure Letter, as well as to the extent that
the relevance of such item as an exception to or, as applicable, disclosure
for purposes of, such other section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent
from the face of such disclosure. The listing of any matter on the Disclosure
Letter shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company or
Parent, as applicable, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is
material, is required to be disclosed by the Company or Parent, as applicable,
under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or
materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in the
Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation by the Company
or Parent, as applicable, of any Contract or Law shall be construed as
an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in the
Disclosure Letter be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

10.11_, _Section_ __ _ 10.12(c)_, and  _Section_ __ _ 10.13_ and _Section_
__ _ 10.14_.

Section 10.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the
economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as
a whole, are not affected in a manner materially adverse to any Party.
Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 10.10 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties in
whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment without
such consent shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 10.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to conflicts of laws principles or rules to the extent such
principles or rules are not mandatorily applicable and would require or permit
the application of the Law of any jurisdiction other than the State
of Delaware; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, except as
otherwise set forth in the Debt Letters as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, all actions, Proceedings, causes of actions, claims, cross-claims
or third party claims of any kind or description (whether at law, in equity,
in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources in
any way relating to the Debt Letters or any of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the performance thereof or the Debt Financing, shall be
exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the
State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles or
rules to the extent such principles or rules are not mandatorily applicable
and would require or permit the application of the Law of any jurisdiction
other than the State of New York.

 

Section 10.12 _Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) The rights and remedies of the Parties shall be cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to the limitations
in _Section_ __ _ 9.3(h)_, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including
the obligations to consummate the Merger, in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such
matter is vested in the federal courts, any federal court located in the
State of Delaware without proof of actual damages or otherwise (and each Party
hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the
Company shall be entitled to specific performance to cause Parent to make
the payment of the Merger Consideration and to cause the Effective Time to
occur and to consummate the Closing, in each case, if and only if ( _i_ ) the
conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied or
waived at the time when the Closing is required to occur pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_, ( _ii_ ) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter, ( _iii_ ) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if
specific

 



79  performance is granted and the Debt Financing are funded, then the Company
will take such action within its control as necessary to ensure that Closing
will occur and ( _iv_ ) Parent and Merger Sub fail to consummate the Merger
at the time when the Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2_. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Party has
an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Each Party agrees that any
Party seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such injunction. The Parties rights in
this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 10.12_. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Company shall not be entitled to enforce specifically to cause Parent to
consummate the Merger if the Debt Financing has not been funded or would not
be funded at the Closing.

 

(b) In addition, each of the Parties ( _i_ ) consents to submit itself, and
hereby submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of
Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any
state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in
the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, ( _ii_ ) agrees that it will not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the
laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum, ( _iii_ ) agrees that it will
not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of
Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any
state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction and (
_iv_ ) consents to service of process being made through the notice procedures
set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 10.6_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party
agrees (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) that it will not bring or
support any action, Proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of the Debt Letters or
the performance thereof or the Debt Financing, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in the
County of New York (and the appropriate appellate courts therefrom), and each
Party submits itself with respect to any such action or Proceeding to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court.

 

Section 10.13 _WAIVER_ _OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, CLAIM
OR COUNTERCLAIM INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE).

 

Section 10.14 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement may only be made against the entities that are expressly identified
as parties hereto, except for claims that may be asserted in accordance
with the Voting Agreements or Confidentiality Agreements. No former, current
or future holders of any equity, partnership or limited liability company
interest, controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Affiliates, attorneys, affiliated (or commonly advised) funds, members,
managers, general or limited partners, stockholders or other Representative of
any party hereto or any of their successors or permitted assignees (each, a "
_Non-Recourse Party_") shall have any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of the parties to this Agreement or for any claim (whether in
tort, contract or otherwise) 

 



80  based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Debt Financing) or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, except as
may arise pursuant to the Voting Agreements or Confidentiality Agreements.
Without limiting the rights of the Company against Parent or Merger Sub
hereunder, in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
the Company agrees not to and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, seek to
enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement
against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Non-Recourse Party
(other than in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreements).
