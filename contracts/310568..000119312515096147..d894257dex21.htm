2\. _The Offer._

 

2.1 The Offer.

(a)  _Provided_ , that this Agreement shall not have terminated in accordance
with its terms and provided that none of the events set forth in clause
(iii)(a) of Annex A shall have occurred and subject to there being no Order
enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the commencement of the Offer
and no Law having been enacted, entered, enforced, promulgated, amended,
issued or deemed applicable to Parent, the Company or any subsidiary or
affiliate thereof having such effect, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act) the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable, but no later than ten
(10) business days (commencing with the first business day after the date of
this Agreement), after the date hereof. Following such launch, each of Parent
and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer,
subject to the terms and conditions hereof.

 

(b) The obligation of Purchaser to accept for payment, purchase and pay for
any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (and not validly withdrawn)
shall be subject to the satisfaction or waiver pursuant to the terms hereof of
(x) the condition (the "Minimum Condition") that at least that number of
Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration
date of the Offer (other than Company Shares tendered by guaranteed delivery
where actual delivery has not occurred), when added to any Company Shares
already owned by Parent or any of its controlled subsidiaries, if any, equal
a majority of the sum of the then outstanding Company Shares plus (without
duplication) a number equal to the number of Company Shares issuable upon the
vesting (including vesting solely as a result of the consummation of the
Offer), conversion, settlement or exercise of all then outstanding warrants,
options, benefit plans, obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable
into Common Shares, or other rights to acquire or be issued Common Shares
(including then outstanding Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, assuming
the effectiveness thereof occurred on the Expiration Date), in each case, with
an exercise or conversion price below the Per Share Amount and (y) the other
conditions set forth in Annex A hereto (the conditions described in clauses
(x) and (y) are collectively referred to as the "Tender Offer Conditions").
Purchaser expressly reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) at any
time or from time to time, in its sole discretion, to amend or waive any such
condition (other than the Minimum Condition which may not be amended or
waived), to increase the price per Company Share payable in the Offer, and to
make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ ,
that without the prior written consent of the Company no change may be made
that decreases the Per Share Amount (except as provided in Section 2.1(h)),
changes the form of consideration payable in the Offer, adds to
the conditions to the Offer, decreases the number of Company Shares sought to
be purchased in the Offer, extends the Offer other than in a manner pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.1 or modifies or amends
any 

 



-12-  condition to the Offer in any manner that broadens such conditions or is
adverse to the holders of Company Shares.

 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Offer shall remain open
until midnight, New York City time, at the end of the twentieth (20th)
business day beginning with (and including) the date that the Offer is
commenced (determined in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange
Act) (the "Expiration Date"), unless the period of time for which the
Offer is open shall have been extended pursuant to, and in accordance with,
the provisions of this Section 2.1 or as required by applicable Laws or the
interpretations of the SEC (in which event the term "Expiration Date" shall
mean the latest time and date as the Offer, as so extended, may expire).

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with Section 9.1, (i) Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
or its staff or the Nasdaq Stock Market that is applicable to the Offer and
(ii) if, on the initial Expiration Date or any subsequent date as of which the
Offer is scheduled to expire, any Tender Offer Condition is not satisfied and
has not been waived, then Purchaser shall extend (and re-extend) the Offer
and its expiration date beyond the initial Expiration Date or such subsequent
date for successive extension periods of up to 10 business days each (each
such extension period, an "Additional Offer Period"); _provided_ , _however_
, that notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section
2.1(d), (A) if any of the events set forth in clause (iii)(a) of Annex A shall
have occurred on or before the initial Expiration Date or the end of any
Additional Offer Period, in no event shall Purchaser be required to extend the
Offer beyond the initial Expiration Date or end of such Additional Offer
Period, as applicable; (B) if, at the initial Expiration Date or the end of
any Additional Offer Period, all of the Tender Offer Conditions, except for
the Minimum Condition, are satisfied or have been waived, Purchaser shall only
be required to extend the Offer and its expiration date beyond the initial
Expiration Date or such subsequent date for one or more additional periods not
to exceed an aggregate of 20 business days, to permit the Minimum Condition to
be satisfied; and (C) in no event shall Purchaser be required to extend the
Offer beyond the Outside Date; _provided_ _further_ , that the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 2.1(d) shall not be deemed to impair,
limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1.

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1,
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any
event within twenty four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer.

 

(f) The Per Share Amount shall, subject to applicable withholding of Taxes, be
net to the applicable seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Purchaser or Parent on Purchasers behalf shall accept for payment
and pay for all Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
promptly following the expiration of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not accept
for payment or pay for any Company Shares if, as a result, Purchaser would
acquire less than the number of Company

 



-13-  Shares necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The time at which
Purchaser first accepts for payment the Company Shares tendered in the Offer
is referred to as the "Acceptance Time". If payment of the Per Share Amount
is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
certificate formerly evidencing Company Shares is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Per Share Amount to a person other than the registered holder
of the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the satisfaction
of Purchaser that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

 

(g) As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of commencement of the
Offer, Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO")
with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or shall incorporate
by reference an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") and form of the
related letter of transmittal and any other ancillary documents pursuant to
which the Offer will be made (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such
other documents, together with all exhibits, supplements and amendments
thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the "Offer Documents").
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Offer Documents
to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares in all material respects to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and
Purchaser shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the
Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of federal securities laws. Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agree to correct promptly any information provided by any of them for use in
the Offer Documents that shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and Parent and Purchaser further agree to use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC,
and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to holders
of Company Shares, in each case in all material respects as required by
applicable federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Purchaser or Parent all information concerning the Company that is required or
reasonably requested by Purchaser or Parent in connection with their
obligations relating to the Offer Documents or any action contemplated by
this Section 2.1(g). Parent and Purchaser shall give the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO
before it is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Company and
its counsel. In addition, Parent and Purchaser agree to (i) provide the
Company and its counsel in writing with any written comments
Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of
such comments, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to provide a reasonably
detailed description of any oral comments Parent, Purchaser or their counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, and (iii) unless
there has been a Change of Recommendation, provide the Company and its
counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any written or oral
response to such comments or any proposed amendment to the Offer Documents
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC.

 

(h) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Acceptance Time, the
outstanding Company Shares are changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason

 



-14-  of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend,
reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or similar transaction, then the Per Share Amount applicable
to such Company Share shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 2.1(d), if,
at any Expiration Date, all of the Tender Offer Conditions (including the
Minimum Condition) shall have been satisfied or have been waived, but (i)
there exists an uncured Financing Failure and (ii) such Financing Failure
impedes the ability of Parent or Purchaser to accept Company Shares for
payment in the Offer, then Purchaser shall be permitted to extend the Offer
for one (1) or more successive periods as determined by Purchaser of up to
ten (10) business days each (or any longer period as may be requested by
Purchaser and approved in advance by the Company) until the Outside Date in
order to permit such Financing Failure to be cured; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event
Purchaser elects to extend the Offer pursuant to and in accordance with this
Section 2.1(i), then each of Parent and Purchaser shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived all of the Tender Offer Conditions (other than the Tender
Offer Condition contemplated by clause (iii)(e) of _Annex A_ , which shall
remain in full force and effect) and its right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Sections 9.1(b)(i), 9.1(b)(ii), 9.1(b)(iii), 9.1(c) (as it
relates to the Tender Offer Condition contemplated by clause (iii)(d) of
_Annex A_ , but not as it relates to the Tender Offer Condition contemplated
by clause (iii)(e) of _Annex A_), or 9.1(d) (it being acknowledged and
agreed that, (A) notwithstanding such irrevocable waiver, without the prior

breach of this Agreement).

 

2.2 Company Action.

 

(a) The Company hereby consents to and approves the Offer pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. The Company hereby further consents to the inclusion

information concerning Parent and Purchaser that is required or reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with its obligations relating to the
Schedule 14D-9. The Company shall give Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it
is filed with the SEC. In addition, the Company agrees to (i) provide Parent,

respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments,
and (iii) unless there has been a Change of Recommendation, provide Parent,

Law, including applicable stock exchange rules, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Purchaser shall
hold in confidence the information contained in such labels, listings and
files and shall use such information only in connection with the Transactions.

extracts of such information then in their possession or control.

 



-16- 3\. _The Merger._

 

3.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 8.1, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time Purchaser
shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the

the Company and specified in such filing, being the "Effective Time").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, if (i)
there exists an uncured Financing Failure on any scheduled Closing Date, (ii)
such Financing Failure impedes the ability of Parent or Purchaser to obtain
the Financing and pay for Company Shares in the Merger, and (iii) each of the
conditions set forth in Article 8 shall otherwise have been satisfied or
waived, then Purchaser shall be permitted to delay the Closing Date and the
Effective Time for a period of up to forty-five (45) business days to permit
such Financing Failure to be cured; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the event
Purchaser elects to delay the Closing Date pursuant to and in accordance with
this Section 3.2, then each of Parent and Purchaser shall be deemed to have
irrevocably waived all of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1.

3.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Company and Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

3.4 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated to conform to the Certificate of
Incorporation of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Certificate of
Incorporation; _provided_ , that such Certificate of Incorporation shall
contain such provisions as are necessary to give full effect to

 



-17-  the exculpation and indemnification provided for in Section 7.5 hereof and
Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Microsemi
Communications, Inc.."

(b) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time,
the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated at the
Effective Time to conform to the Bylaws of Purchaser as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided by Law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws;
_provided_ , that such Bylaws shall contain such provisions as are necessary
to give full effect to the exculpation and indemnification provided for in
Section 7.5 hereof.

 

3.5 Directors and Officers. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and, except as
determined by Parent or Purchaser prior to the Effective Time, the officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

 

3.6 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or the holders
of any of the following securities:

(a) Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than any Company Shares to be canceled pursuant to
Section 3.6(b) and any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and shall
be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the Per Share Amount (the "Merger Consideration")
payable to the holder of such Company Share, upon surrender, in the manner
provided in Section 3.9. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed
into a different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split,
division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to the extent
appropriate (taking into account any prior adjustments pursuant to Section
2.1(h), for all purposes of this Article 3.

 

(b) Each Company Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Company
Share owned by Purchaser, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and retired without any conversion thereof, and no payment
or distribution shall be made and no consideration of any kind shall be
delivered with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of common stock of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



-18- 3.7 Company Stock Options; Company RSUs; ESPP.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company Stock
Options, each Company Stock Option (excluding the Company Stock Options
described in Section 3.7(b) below) that is then outstanding, whether vested or
unvested, will be assumed by Parent (each, an "Assumed Option"). Each Assumed
Option will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
of such option immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the
applicable vesting restrictions, except for administrative changes, including
a transfer to Parents designated stock administration provider, that are not
adverse to the holder of the Assumed Option or to which the holder consents
and except that (i) each Assumed Option will be exercisable for a number of
shares of common stock of Parent (the "Parent Common Stock") equal to the
product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that would be issuable
upon exercise of the Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by a quotient obtained by dividing (A) the Merger Consideration by
(B) the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC for the five trading days immediately preceding (but not including)
the Effective Time (the "Exchange Ratio"), rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) the per share exercise price
for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option will
be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the per share exercise price
for such Assumed Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, and (iii) all references
to the "Company" in the applicable Company Stock Plans and the stock option
agreements will be references to Parent. It is the intention of the parties
that each Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent shall qualify following
the Effective Time as an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of
the Code to the extent permitted under Section 422 of the Code and to the
extent such Company Stock Option qualified as an incentive stock option prior
to the Effective Time. It is intended that the assumption of the Assumed
Options by Parent shall comply with Sections 409A and 424 of the Code and this
Section 3.7(a) shall be construed consistent with such intent.

 

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the holders of Company Stock
Options, each Company Stock Option that is then outstanding, whether vested or
unvested, that (i) has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Stock Option greater than eight dollars and
twenty cents ($8.20), or (ii) was granted pursuant to the Restated 2001 Stock
Incentive Plan, has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company Stock Option less than or equal to eight dollars and
twenty cents ($8.20), and the holder thereof has not consented to the
assumption by Parent of such Company Stock Option on the terms set forth in
Section 3.7(a), shall in each such case be cancelled; and (x) in the case of a
Company Stock Option referred to in clause (i) above, the holder of such
Company Stock Option shall not be entitled to any payment with respect thereto
or in respect thereof, (y) in the case of a Company Stock Option referred to
in clause (ii) above with a per-share exercise price that is less than the
Merger Consideration, the holder of such Company Stock Option shall be
entitled to a cash payment equal to (1) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (2) the
amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the per-share exercise price
of such Company Stock Option, or (z) in the case of a Company Stock Option
referred to in clause (ii) above with a per-share exercise price that is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, the holder of such Company
Stock Option shall not be entitled to any payment with respect thereto or in
respect thereof.

 



-19- (c) Effective as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Purchaser or the holders of
Company RSUs, each Company RSU that is then outstanding will be assumed by
Parent (each, an "Assumed RSU"). Each Assumed RSU will continue to have, and
be subject to, the same terms and conditions of such Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including the applicable vesting restrictions,
except for administrative changes that are not adverse to the holder of the
Assumed RSU or to which the holder consents and except that (i) each Company
RSU shall cover a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
of the number of Company Shares that are subject to the Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio,
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Company Stock and
(ii) all references to the "Company" in the applicable Company Stock Plans and
restricted stock unit agreements will be references to Parent.

 

(d) Any offering period underway immediately prior to the Effective Time under
the ESPP, and the rights of each participant in the ESPP with respect to such
offering period, shall be cancelled upon the Effective Time (any such period,
a "Shortened Offering Period"), and each active participant in such Shortened
Offering Period at the Effective Time shall receive (i) a refund in cash of
the amount of such participants accumulated payroll contributions to the ESPP
with respect to such Shortened Offering Period, and (ii) for each share of
Company Common Stock such participant would have been entitled to purchase
under the ESPP for the Shortened Offering Period (taking into account the
participants accumulated payroll contributions through the Effective Time,
and assuming that such participant was permitted to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock under the ESPP at the Effective Time for the Shortened Offering
Period), a cash payment equal to (x) the Merger Consideration, less (y) the
per-share purchase price for a share of Company Common Stock under the ESPP
for the Shortened Offering Period, subject to all applicable income and
employment withholding Taxes. After the date of this Agreement, no new
participants shall be permitted to enroll in the ESPP, no participant may
increase the rate of his or her participation in the ESPP from the level in
effect on the date of this Agreement, and no new offering or purchase period
shall commence under the ESPP. The actions described in this Section 3.7(d)
will be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.

 

(e) Prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall provide notice (in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) to each holder of an outstanding award
granted pursuant to any Company Stock Plan, as well as each participant in the
ESPP, describing the treatment of such award in accordance with this Section
3.7. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause there to
be taken, as the case may be) such actions, shall obtain such consents, adopt
(or cause there to be adopted) any amendments of any Company Stock Plan and
any awards thereunder, and adopt (or cause there to be adopted) any amendments
of the ESPP and any purchase rights thereunder, as may be necessary to effect
the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.7.

(f) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-8 (to the extent available) with respect to the Parent Common Stock
subject to the Assumed Options and Assumed RSUs and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as
soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than twenty (20)
business days, following the Effective Time.

 



-20- 3.8 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by the stockholders of the Company who shall have
neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal
in respect of such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, "Dissenting Company Shares") shall not be converted into, or
represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Such
Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised
value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by the
stockholders of the Company who shall have failed to perfect or who shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no longer
be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be deemed
to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates
that formerly evidenced such Company Shares in the manner provided in Section
3.9.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands
for payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

3.9 Surrender of Company Shares; Stock Transfer Books.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust
company to act as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") for the payment of funds
to which holders of Company Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section
3.6(a). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate amount payable
pursuant to Section 3.6(a). In the event the amounts deposited with the Paying
Agent shall be insufficient to make all such Payments, Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in
an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount of funds required to
make such payments. The Paying Agent shall make payment of the funds to
holders of Company Shares in accordance with this Section 3.9. Such funds
shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or (after the
Effective Time) the Surviving Corporation, and any and all interest earned on
the funds shall be paid by the Paying Agent to Parent or (after the Effective
Time) the Surviving Corporation. The Surviving Corporation shall bear and pay
all charges and expenses, including those of Paying Agent, incurred in
connection with the payment of funds to holders of Company Shares.

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall cause to be mailed to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a
holder of

 



-21-  record of Company Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 3.6(a) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates evidencing such Company Shares (the "Certificates") shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates pursuant
to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to promptly receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Company Share formerly
evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall then be canceled.
No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon
the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such
Certificate. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered
on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment
shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either
have been paid or are not applicable. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with this Agreement upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Company Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificates.

 

(c) At any time following the ninth month after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds which had been made available to the Paying Agent and
not disbursed to holders of Company Shares (including all interest and other
income received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to
it), and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation and Parent (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and
other similar laws) with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a Company Share for any Merger Consideration properly
delivered in respect of such Company Share to a public official pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise provided herein
or by applicable law.

 

(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may require as indemnity against claims 

 



-22-  that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, pursuant to this
Agreement.

3.10 Withholding Rights. Each of Purchaser, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to Article 2 or 3 of this Agreement
to any holder of Company Shares, Company RSUs and Company Stock Options such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code") and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted and withheld, and paid over to the appropriate Government
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Shares,
Company RSUs and Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. Except for such withholding rights, such holder is
solely responsible for any and all liabilities or obligations of such holder
for Taxes that may arise with respect to the payment of such consideration
pursuant to this Agreement.

(a) Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company or (ii) otherwise carry out the
provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its officers and directors shall
be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power
of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances
in law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm title to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the provisions of this
Agreement, and the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are
authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take any and all such
action.

(c) Except as set forth above and except for changes since March 13, 2015
resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options or vesting of Company
RSUs outstanding on such date, there are no outstanding (i) options, warrants
or other rights, Contracts, arrangements or commitments of any character
relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or
sell any shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, (ii) shares of capital stock of or other voting
securities or ownership interests in the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
or (iii) restricted shares, restricted share units, stock appreciation rights,
performance shares, contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar
securities or rights that are derivative of or provide economic benefits
based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any capital stock or
other voting securities (including any bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness having voting rights or convertible into securities having
voting rights) or ownership interests in the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to collectively as
the "Company Securities").

 

(d) All Company Shares subject to issuance, upon issuance on the terms and
conditions specified in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable,
will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and
free of any preemptive rights. There are no voting trusts or other Contracts
to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party with respect to the
voting of any capital stock of, or other equity interest in, the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

(e) There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company
Shares or any other Company Securities or any capital stock of any Company
Subsidiary or to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a
loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Company Subsidiary or any
other person, other than Tax withholdings and exercise price

 



-25-  settlements upon the exercise of Company Stock Options or vesting of Company
RSUs. Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and was issued
free of any preemptive rights, and each such share is owned by the Company or
another Company Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens or Contracts or other
limitations on the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys voting rights.

(f) Section 4.3(f) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a listing of (i) all
equity plans of the Company (including all Company Stock Plans); (ii) all
outstanding Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, as of March 13, 2015;
(iii) the date of grant and name of holder of each Company Stock Option and
Company RSU and the vesting schedule thereof; (iv) with respect to each such
award, the portion of which that is vested as of March 13, 2015 and if
applicable, the exercise price or repurchase price therefor, (v) the date upon
which each Company Stock Option would normally be expected to expire absent
termination of employment or other acceleration, and (vi) with respect to
Company Stock Options, whether or not such Company Stock Option is intended to
qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of
the Code. Each grant of a Company Stock Option was duly authorized no later
than the date on which the grant of such Company Stock Option was by its terms
to be effective (the "Grant Date") by all necessary corporate action,
including, as applicable, approval by the Company Board (or a duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof), or a duly authorized delegate
thereof, and any required stockholder approval by the necessary number of
votes or written consents. The ESPP was duly authorized prior to the date any
award or right was granted thereunder by all necessary corporate action,
including, as applicable, approval by the Company Board and shareholder
approval by the necessary number of votes or written consents. Each Company
Stock Option and each Company RSU was granted in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Company Stock Plan and all other applicable Law, and the per
share exercise price of each Company Stock Option was not less than the
fair market value of a Company Share on the applicable Grant Date. Each award
or right granted under the ESPP was granted in accordance with the terms of
the ESPP and all other applicable Law. No Company Stock Option or Company RSU
is, has been or would be subject to any tax, penalty or interest under
Section 409A of the Code. No award has been granted, or is currently
outstanding, under any Company Stock Plan other than the Company Stock Options
and the Company RSUs. No Company Stock Option or Company RSU has been
granted, or is currently outstanding, other than Company Stock Options and
Company RSUs granted under the Company Stock Plans. The Company has no
obligations under or with respect to the ESPP other than as to rights
outstanding under and in accordance with the ESPP as to the purchase period
in effect thereunder as of the date of this Agreement.

4.4 Authority Relative to this Agreement.

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, assuming
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated in
accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, to consummate the Transactions.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (assuming that Merger is
consummated in accordance with Section

 



-26-  251(h) of the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or
hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally, and (ii) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held on March 16, 2015,
at which all of the directors of the Company were present, unanimously (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including each of the Offer and the Merger (collectively, the "Transactions"),
are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of the Company and holders
of Company Shares, (ii) based on written representations and warranties made
by Parent and Purchaser, determined that neither Parent nor Purchaser is an
"interested stockholder" as defined in Section 203(c) of the DGCL; (iii)
adopted this Agreement and the Transactions (such adoption having been made in
accordance with the DGCL; (iv) recommended that the holders of Company Shares
accept the Offer and tender Company Shares pursuant to the Offer and (v)
resolving that this Agreement and the Merger shall be governed by Section
251(h) of the DGCL and that the Merger shall be consummated as soon as
practicable following the Acceptance Time. Assuming the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 5.7 are true and correct, such resolutions are
sufficient to render inapplicable to Parent and Purchaser and this Agreement,
the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction, and the Tender Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, the provisions of Section 203 of the
DGCL to the extent, if any, such section would otherwise be applicable to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction, or the
Support Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, and no other
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation, and no analogous
provision in the Certificate of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws, applies
to the Company with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any
other Transaction, or the Support Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
thereby. There is no stockholder rights plan, "poison pill" antitakeover plan
or similar device in effect with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
or otherwise bound.

 

4.5 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, (i) conflict with
or violate the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or equivalent
organizational documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
subject to obtaining the Company Required Approvals, conflict with or violate
any U.S. or non-U.S. law (statutory, common or otherwise), including any
statute, ordinance, regulation, rule, code, executive order, injunction,
judgment, decree or other order of a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction ("Law") applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
bound or affected, or (iii) subject to obtaining the consents that are
required to be listed in Section 4.5(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, result in
any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would become a

 



-27-  default or breach) under, or (except with respect to Company Stock Options,
Company RSUs and the ESPP in connection with the treatment of such awards
under Section 3.7 of this Agreement) give to others any right of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
pursuant to, or result in the loss of a material benefit under any Company
Material Contract or material Permit to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any
property or asset of any of them is bound or affected, except, with respect
to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or materially delay beyond the
Outside Date the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (y) have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, except (i) for (w)
the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC, (x) applicable requirements, if
any, of the Exchange Act and state securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky
Laws"), (y) the pre-merger notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and similar
requirements in foreign countries regarding antitrust or competition matters,
and (z) filing of a Certificate of Merger in appropriate form as required by
the DGCL (collectively, the "Company Required Approvals"), and (ii) where the
failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to
make such filings or notifications, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or materially delay beyond the
Outside Date the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (y) have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.6 Permits; Compliance. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is
in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, certifications,
approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction,
including with respect to any Environmental Laws, necessary for each of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its
properties or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the
"Permits"), except where the failure to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of, any of the Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (y) have a Material Adverse Effect.
No suspension or cancellation of any of the Permits is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, and there have occurred no defaults
under, violations of, or events giving rise to a right of termination,
amendment or cancellation of any such Permits (with or without notice, the
lapse of time or both), except where the failure to have, or the suspension or
cancellation of any of the Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (y) have a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is, and neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary since January 1, 2011 has been, in conflict
with, or in default, breach or violation of, (i) any Law or Military
Specification applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which
any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or
affected, or (ii) any Company Material Contract or material Permit to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a

 



-28-  party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any property or
asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound, except for any such
conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to (x) prevent or delay beyond the
Outside Date the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (y) have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any Governmental Authority
of competent jurisdiction alleging that it is not in compliance in all
material respects with any Law or Military Specification.

 

4.7 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

 

(a) The Company has filed all forms, reports and other documents required to
be filed by it with the SEC since January 1, 2011 (such documents filed since
January 1, 2011, and those filed by the Company with the SEC subsequent to the
date of this Agreement, if any, including any amendments thereof, the "SEC
Reports"). Each SEC Report (x) complied, or if filed subsequent to the date
of the Agreement will comply, as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX")

not, at the time it was filed (or, if amended prior to the date hereof, as of
the date of such amendment), contain, or if filed after the date hereof at
the time of the filing will not contain, any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Company
Subsidiary has been or is required to file any form, report or other document
with the SEC.

 

(b) Each of the audited consolidated financial statements contained in the SEC
Reports (collectively, the "Audited Company Financial Statements") (A) have
been, or will be, as the case may be, prepared from and in accordance with and
accurately reflect the books and records of the Company and its consolidated
Company Subsidiaries in all material respects, (B) complied, or will comply,
as the case may be, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in
all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (C) was, or will be,
as the case may be, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and (D)
fairly presents, or will fairly present, as the case may be, in all material
respects the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows of the Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited interim statements, to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments). The unaudited financial information contained in the
SEC Reports (such unaudited financial information together with the Audited

prepared from and in accordance with and accurately reflect the books and
records of the Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries in all

(c) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and its consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at December 31,
2014, including the notes thereto (the "2014 Balance Sheet"), neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of a nature
required by GAAP to be disclosed on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company, except for (x) liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since the date of the 2014
Balance Sheet that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and (y)
liabilities and obligations incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or as required by this Agreement.

 

(d) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (and each former principal executive officer
of the Company and each former principal financial officer of the Company, as
applicable) has made all certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act or Sections 302 and 906 of SOX and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the SEC Reports,
and the statements contained in such certifications are true and correct. For
purposes of this Section 4.7(d) "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. Neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has
arranged any outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive
officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX. The Company is in
compliance in all material respects with SOX.

(e) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, or
has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including any contract or
arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the
Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)),
where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract or arrangement
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
Companys or such Company Subsidiarys published financial statements or other
of the SEC Reports.

 

(f) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting and accounting designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes, including to provide reasonable assurance
that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general
or specific authorizations; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to
maintain asset accountability; (iii) access to assets that could have a
material effect on the Companys financial statements is permitted only in
accordance with managements general or specific authorization;

 



-30-  and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the
existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with
respect to any differences.

 

(g) The Company has in place "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to
ensure that material information that is required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and made known to its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

 

(h) The Companys management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness
of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting in compliance
with the requirements of Section 404 of SOX for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2014, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. The Company has disclosed to the Companys outside auditors and
the audit committee of the Company (and made copies of such disclosures
available to Parent) (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely
to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data, (B) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting,
and (C) any written claim or allegation of any of the foregoing. The Company
has not received from its independent auditors any oral or written
notification of a (i) "reportable condition" or (ii) "material weakness" in
the Companys internal controls. For purposes of this Agreement, the
terms "reportable condition" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Statements of Auditing Standards 60, as in effect on
the date hereof.

 

(i) The Company has furnished or made available to Parent copies of all
comment letters received by the Company from the SEC since January 1, 2011,
relating to the Companys SEC Reports and all responses of the Company
thereto. There are no outstanding unresolved issues with respect to the
Company or the SEC Reports noted in comment letters or other
correspondence received by the Company or its attorneys from the SEC, and
there are no pending (i) formal or, to the knowledge of the Company, informal
investigations of the Company by the SEC or (ii) inspection of an audit of the
Companys financial statements by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board. To the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2011, there has been
no material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any
Company Subsidiary has engaged in improper or illegal accounting or auditing
practices or maintains improper or inadequate internal accounting controls. To
the knowledge of the Company, since January 1, 2011, no current or former
attorney representing the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has
reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Company Board or any committee thereof
or to any director or executive officer of the Company.

(j) To the knowledge of the Company, no employee of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries has provided or is providing information to any law

 



-31-  enforcement agency regarding the possible commission of any crime or the
violation or possible violation of any applicable legal requirements of the
type described in Section 806 of SOX. 

(k) The Company has heretofore furnished or made available to Parent complete
and correct copies of all amendments and modifications that have not been
filed by the Company with the SEC to all Contracts, documents and other
instruments that previously had been filed by the Company with the SEC and are
currently in effect.

 

4.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since the date of the 2014 Balance
Sheet through the date of this Agreement, except as contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their
businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice. Since the date of the 2014 Balance Sheet (i) there has
not been any event, condition, circumstance, development, change or effect,
having, or that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) none of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries has taken any action that if taken between the date
hereof and the Effective Time would constitute a material breach of Section
6.1 (other than 6.1(b), 6.1(g), 6.1(l), 6.1(n) - 6.1(p), 6.1(q), 6.1(r)).

 

4.9 Absence of Litigation. There is (i) no Action pending, or (ii) to the
knowledge of the Company, no inquiry or investigation pending or Action
threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any property or
asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that, in each case, (A) would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside Date
the consummation of the Transactions or (B) has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any property or asset of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is subject to any consent decree,
settlement agreement or similar written agreement between the Company and any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction that is materially adverse to
the Company, or any Order of any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to (x) prevent
or materially delay beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Offer or
the Merger or (y) have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

4.10 Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(a) Section 4.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule lists all Plans. The "Plans"
shall mean: (i) all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and all
bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
severance or other material benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all
employment, termination or severance Contracts to which the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate is a party (except for offer letters that provide for
employment that is terminable at will and without material cost or liability
to the Company or any Company Subsidiary), with respect to which the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate has or could have any material obligation or that
are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or
director of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, (ii) each employee benefit
plan for which the Company or any Company Subsidiary could incur liability
under Section 4069 of ERISA in the event such plan

 



-32-  has been or were to be terminated, (iii) any plan in respect of which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary could incur liability under Section 4212(c)
of ERISA, and (iv) any material consulting contracts, arrangements or
understandings between the Company or any Company Subsidiary and any natural
person consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (all Plans,
excluding Plans not subject to U.S. Law, the "US Plans"). The Company has
made available to Purchaser a true and complete copy of each Plan and has made
available to Purchaser a true and complete copy of each material document, if
any, prepared in connection with each such Plan (except for
individual written Company Stock Option and Company RSU agreements, in which
case only forms of such agreements have been made available, unless such
individual agreements materially differ from such forms), including as
applicable (i) a copy of each trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each
most recent summary plan description and summary of material modifications,
(iii) annual reports on Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 5500 for the
most recent three (3) plan years, (iv) the most recently received IRS
determination letter for each such Plan, and (v) the most recently prepared
actuarial report and financial statement in connection with each such Plan.
There are no oral Plans. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
any express or implied commitment (i) to create, incur liability with respect
to or cause to exist any other material employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement, (ii) to enter into any Contract to provide compensation or
benefits to any individual other than in the ordinary course of business, or
(iii) to modify, change or terminate any Plan, other than with respect to a
modification, change or termination required by ERISA, the Code or other
applicable law.

 

(b) None of the Plans is a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section
3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "Multiemployer Plan"), a "multiple employer
plan" (within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code) (a "Multiple Employer
Plan"), a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of
Section 3(40) of ERISA) or a plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.

(c) None of the Plans (i) provides for the payment of separation, severance,
termination or similar-type benefits to any person, (ii) obligates the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to pay separation, severance, termination or
similar-type benefits solely or partially as a result of any Transaction, or
(iii) obligates the Company or any Company Subsidiary to make any payment or
provide any benefit in connection with a "change in ownership or effective
control", within the meaning of such term under Section 280G of the Code, or
in connection with an event directly or indirectly related to such a change.
None of the Plans provides for or promises retiree medical, disability or life
insurance benefits to any current or former employee, officer or director of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except as required by Section 4980B of
the Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or similar applicable state law. There is
no contract, plan or arrangement covering any current or former director,
employee, or consultant of the Company that, individually or collectively,
could give rise to any payment or benefit as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as provided in this Agreement,
the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (alone or together with any other event which,
standing alone, would not by itself trigger such entitlement or acceleration)
will not (i) entitle any Person to any payment, forgiveness of indebtedness,
vesting, distribution, or increase in benefits under or with respect to any
Plan, (ii) otherwise trigger any acceleration (of vesting or payment of
benefits or otherwise) under or with respect to any Plan, or (iii) trigger
any obligation

 



-33-  to fund any Plan. No current or former director, employee, or consultant of
the Company is entitled to receive a gross-up payment from the Company with
respect to any Taxes that may be imposed upon such individual pursuant to
Section 409A of the Code, Section 4999 of the Code, or otherwise. The
contracts, plans and arrangements disclosed in Section 4.10(c) of the
Disclosure Schedule are referred to herein as the "Disclosed Employee
Arrangements."

(d) Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws
including ERISA and the Code. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
performed all material obligations required to be performed by them under and
are not in material default under or in material violation of, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there is no material default or material violation
by any party to, any Plan. No Action is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened with respect to any Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits in the ordinary course of business) and to the knowledge of the
Company, no fact or event exists that is reasonably likely to give rise to any
such Action.

 

(e) Each US Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has timely received a favorable determination, notification or advisory
letter from the IRS covering all of the provisions applicable to the US Plan
for which such letters are currently available that the US Plan is so
qualified, has a remaining period of time under applicable
Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such letter
and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination, or
may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype plan, and each trust
established in connection with any US Plan that is intended to be exempt from
federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a

respects and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by any

material liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or
future services to be refrained from performing, by the Covered
Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) were not, and are
not, calculated based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into
the Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. The adoption, approval,

employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement
solely by independent directors of the Company in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto and the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d10(d)(2) is

(collectively with the matter disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule, the
"Permitted Title Exceptions"). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has received written notice of any condemnation, expropriation or other
proceeding in eminent domain affecting the Company Owned Real Property or any
portion thereof or interest therein, and to the knowledge of the Company, no
such proceedings are threatened or proposed. To the knowledge of the Company,
the Company Owned Real Property is not subject to any special assessment nor
any zoning or other land-use regulation proceeding, nor any change in any Law
or Permit that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or that
seeks to impose any material legal restraint on or prohibition against or
limit the Surviving Corporations ability to operate the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries substantially as it was operated prior to

Real Property.

accurate list of all leases of real property ("Company Leased Real Property")
to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party. All such leases of
real property to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, and
all amendments and modifications thereto, are in full force and effect and
have not been modified or amended, and there exists no default under any such
lease by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, nor any event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default thereunder by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, except as would not reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside Date consummation of the
Offer or the Merger and as, individually or in the aggregate, would not have,
or be reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay beyond the Outside
Date consummation of the Offer or the Merger and as, individually or in
the aggregate, would not have, or be reasonably expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any
material alterations, additions or improvements to the Company Leased Real
Property that are required to be removed (or of which any landlord or
sublandlord could require removal) at the termination of the applicable lease
term. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received written
notice of any condemnation, expropriation or other proceeding in eminent
domain affecting the Company Leased Real Property or any portion thereof or
interest therein, and to the knowledge of the Company, no such proceedings are
threatened or proposed. To the knowledge of the Company, the Company Leased
Real Property is not subject to any special assessment nor zoning or other
land-use regulation proceeding, nor any change in any Law or Permit that would

Subsidiaries substantially as it was operated prior to the date of this

registrar), (iii) the application or registration number, and (iv) the filing
date or issuance/registration/grant date. Section 4.14(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule lists any and all actions that must be taken within 90 days after
the Effective Date for the purposes of obtaining, maintaining, perfecting or
preserving or renewing any Company Intellectual Property Registrations,
including the payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal fees or the

certificates.

(b) _Validity_. Each item of the Company Intellectual Property Registrations
is valid and subsisting, all necessary registration, maintenance and renewal
fees currently due in connection with such Company Intellectual Property
Registrations have been made and all necessary documents, recordations
and certificates in connection with such Company Intellectual Property
Registrations have been filed with the relevant patent, copyright, trademark
or other authorities in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, as the
case may be, for the purposes of prosecuting, perfecting and maintaining such
Company Intellectual Property Registrations. The Company has no knowledge of
any information, materials, facts, or circumstances, including any information
or fact that would constitute prior art that is required to be disclosed in
connection with the applicable Company Intellectual Property Registration,
that would render any of the Company Intellectual Property Registrations
invalid or unenforceable, or would materially affect any pending application
for any Company Intellectual Property Registrations and the Company has not
knowingly misrepresented, or knowingly failed to disclose, any facts or
circumstances in any application for any Company Intellectual Property
Registrations that would constitute fraud or a misrepresentation with respect
to such application or that would otherwise affect the validity or
enforceability of any Company Intellectual Property Registrations. The
foregoing will not be construed as a warranty that any Patent, or any
Trademark registration, will issue based on a Patent or Trademark application.

(c) _Rights to IP Ordered or Awarded_. Except as set forth in Section
4.14(c)of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is a party to or bound by any Order or arbitral award that requires
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to grant to any Third Party any
license, covenant not to sue, immunity or other right with respect to any
Owned Company Intellectual Property or restricting in any material manner, the
use, transfer, or licensing thereof by the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
or which renders invalid or unenforceable such Owned Company Intellectual
Property.

(d) _No Proceedings_. Since January 1, 2011, no Company Intellectual Property
Registration is or has been involved in any interference, reissue,
reexamination, opposition, cancellation or other proceeding, including any
Action regarding invalidity or 

 



-40-  unenforceability, in the United States or any foreign jurisdiction, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, no such Action has been threatened in any
written communication delivered to the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(e) _Trade Secrets_. The Company and Company Subsidiaries have, in accordance
with the applicable Law of each relevant jurisdiction, taken reasonable steps
to protect their rights in and to their Trade Secrets, including by not making
any disclosure of Trade Secrets except under written confidentiality
obligations (other than former Trade Secrets intentionally publicly disclosed
by the Company without confidentiality obligations in its reasonable business
judgment), and including requiring each employee, consultant and contractor
who has had access to Company or Third Party Trade Secrets to execute
confidentiality agreements in substantially the forms provided to Parent prior
to the date hereof. To the knowledge of the Company, there has been no
misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of any material Trade Secret
included in the Owned Company Intellectual Property. The Company and Company
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with and have not
breached in any material respect any contractual obligations to protect the
Trade Secrets of Third Parties in accordance with the terms of any Contracts
relating to such Third Party Trade Secrets.

(f) _Employees, Consultants, and Contractors_. Since January 1, 2011, the
Company and Company Subsidiaries have had and enforced policies requiring each
employee, consultant and contractor who is involved in the development of any
Company Products to execute proprietary information, confidentiality and
assignment agreements that, to extent permitted by applicable Law, assign to
the Company and/or a Company Subsidiary all Intellectual Property and
Intellectual Property Rights that are developed by the employees in the
course of their employment, and, with respect to consultants or contractors,
all Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights that are developed
by the consultants or contractors in the course of performing services for the
Company or any Company Subsidiaries (each, an "Employee IP Agreement"). Since
January 1, 2011, each person who is or was during such time an employee,
officer, consultant and contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
who are or were involved in the development of any Company Products has
signed an Employee IP Agreement, in a form substantially similar to, or with
provisions with substantially similar legal effect as the provisions of, one
of the forms made available to Parent with respect to proprietary
information, confidentiality, and assignment and licensing of Intellectual
Property and Intellectual Property Rights. To the knowledge of the Company, no
person who is or was an employee, officer, consultant or contractor of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary involved in the development of any Company
Products is, or since, January 1, 2011, has been, in default or breach of any
term of any Employee IP Agreement, non-disclosure agreement,
assignment agreement, or similar Contract relating to Intellectual Property
or Intellectual Property Rights entered into between such employee, officer,
consultant or contractor and the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
connection with such individuals employment or other engagement with the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. All assignments of registered Patents
included in the Company Intellectual Property Registrations have been duly
executed and recorded with the appropriate Governmental Authorities. No
person who is or was during such time an employee, officer, consultant or
contractor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any ownership, license
or other right, title or interest, directly or indirectly, in whole or in
part, in any material Owned Company Intellectual Property. No material
Intellectual Property or material Intellectual Property Rights excluded or
carved-out from any employee assignment contained in any 

 



-41-  Employee IP Agreement that is related to any Company Product or to any other
aspect of the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is included in
(or claimed or purported to be included in) any material Intellectual
Property or material Intellectual Property Rights included in any Company
Products.

(g) _Enforceability, Validity of IP_. To the knowledge of the Company, there
are no facts or circumstances that would be reasonably expected to render
invalid or unenforceable any of the Intellectual Property Rights included in
the Owned Company Intellectual Property (or provide any reasonable grounds
therefor). To the knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect, limit,
restrict, impair, or impede the ability of Surviving Corporation and
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to use and practice the Owned
Company Intellectual Property from and after the Effective Time in
substantially the same manner in which it was used prior to the Effective
Time. Since January 1, 2011, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has received any written notice of any Action challenging the validity or
enforceability of any of the Company Intellectual Property Registrations or
the Owned Copyrights, or containing any threat on the part of any person to
bring an Action that any of the Company Intellectual Property Registrations or
the Owned Copyrights is invalid, is unenforceable or has been misused, other
than any Action finally resolved prior to January 1, 2014.

 

(h) _No Infringement or Misappropriation of Company IP_. To the knowledge of
the Company, no Third Party is infringing, misappropriating, or using or
disclosing without authorization any Intellectual Property Rights owned or
exclusively licensed by Company or any Company Subsidiary. Since January 1,
2011, neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary has commenced any Action
with respect to infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property
Rights owned by or exclusively licensed to Company or any Company Subsidiary
against any Third Party. Since January 1, 2011, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has received any written notice of any Action
challenging the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys exclusive ownership of
any Intellectual Property Rights included in the Owned Company Intellectual
Property or claiming that any other person has any claim of legal or
beneficial ownership with respect thereto (other than any Action finally
resolved prior to January 1, 2014).

 

(i) _Infringement by Company_. The operation of the business of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as such business currently is conducted or is
currently contemplated to be conducted, including, without limitation, the
design, development, manufacture, use, import, sale licensing or other
exploitation other of Company Products, does not, and will not, infringe
or misappropriate any Intellectual Property Rights of any Third Party
(provided, however, that with respect to Patents, such representation is made
only to the Knowledge of the Company). Since January 1, 2011, Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have not received any written notice of any Action
alleging that the Company or any Company Subsidiary has infringed,
misappropriated, used or disclosed without authorization or otherwise violated
any Intellectual Property Rights of any person, or that any Company Product
infringes, misappropriates, uses or discloses without authorization, or
otherwise violates any Intellectual Property Rights of any person and, to the
knowledge of Company, there are no facts, circumstances or information that
would be the basis for such Action (other than any Action finally resolved
prior to January 1, 2014). Since January 1, 2011, neither the Company nor any

 



-42-  Company Subsidiary has received any written communication inviting the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to take a license, covenant not to sue, or
the like with respect to a Third Persons Intellectual Property Rights, other
than in connection with licenses or covenants not to sue granted to Company or
the Company Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and not related to
any infringement or other violation by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(other than any Action finally resolved prior to January 1, 2014).

(j) _Ownership; Licenses_. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own the
Owned Company Intellectual Property free and clear of all Liens (except for
the Outbound Intellectual Property Contracts), and have not exclusively
licensed (under any Contract in effect as of the date of this Agreement) any
such Owned Company Intellectual Property to any Third Party, and are under no
obligation under any Contract in effect as of the date hereof to grant any
such licenses. Company and the Company Subsidiaries have not permitted
the Companys rights in any Owned Company Intellectual Property to lapse or
enter the public domain, except to the extent such failure would not cause a
material adverse effect on the business of Company or the Company
Subsidiaries.

 

(k) _Scheduled IP Agreements_. Section 4.14(k) of the Disclosure Schedule
contains a complete and accurate list of:

 

(i) all Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party,
or by which (1) with respect to Owned Company Intellectual Property is
licensed or assigned to any third party ("Outbound Intellectual Property
Contracts") (other than Customer Licenses), or (2) pursuant to which a third
party has licensed or assigned any Intellectual Property Rights to the
Company ("Inbound Intellectual Property Contracts"), other than Off-the Shelf
Software Licenses and licenses of Open Source Software. The Inbound
Intellectual Property Contracts and Outbound Intellectual Property
Contracts, together, are referred to herein as the "Company Intellectual
Property Contracts"; and

(ii) All Company Intellectual Property Contracts that have not expired or
terminated in accordance with their terms are in full force and effect and are
enforceable in accordance with their terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting
the rights and remedies of creditors generally). The Company and each Company
Subsidiary is in material compliance with, and has not materially breached any
term of, any such Company Intellectual Property Contracts (other than any
material breaches that the Company or a Company Subsidiary has cured) and, to
the knowledge of Company, all other parties to such Company Intellectual
Property Contracts are in material compliance with, and have not materially
breached any term of, such Company Intellectual Property Contracts (other than
any material breaches that any other party has cured). There are no pending
disputes regarding such Company Intellectual Property Contracts ,
including disputes with respect to the scope thereof, performance thereunder,
or payments made or received in connection therewith. Correct and complete
copies of all Company Intellectual Property Contracts have been made available
to Parent.

 

(l) _Effect of Transaction_. Neither the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the Transactions, will violate or
result in the breach, material modification, cancellation, termination or
suspension of, loss of any rights

 



-43-  or acceleration of any payments under the Company Intellectual Property
Contracts (or give rise to any right with respect to any of the foregoing).
Immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will have
and be permitted to exercise all of the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries rights under the Company Intellectual Property Contracts (and
will have the same rights with respect to the Intellectual Property and
Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties under the Company Intellectual
Property Contracts ) to the same extent that Company and the Company
Subsidiaries would have had, and been able to exercise, had this Agreement not
been entered into, and the Transactions not occurred, without the payment of

subcontracts with any Governmental Authority in connection with the conduct of
its business, and no such suspension or debarment has been initiated or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened. To the knowledge of the Company,
there is no ongoing Action by any Governmental Authority relating to the
material Contracts or subcontracts with any Governmental Authority or the
violation of any Law relating to material Contracts with any Governmental
Authority, subcontracts, or export controls.

(d) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their officers, directors,
managers and employees collectively hold all security clearances necessary
for the operation of their business as presently conducted in all material
respects if and as required by any material Contract with any Governmental
Authority.

 

4.28 Affiliate Transactions. There are no existing contracts, transactions,
indebtedness or other arrangements, or any related series thereof, between
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of
the directors, officers or other affiliates of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, except for (i) payment of salary
for services rendered, (ii) reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred on
behalf of the Company, (iii) any agreements with officers or directors
providing for indemnification obligations of the Company to such individuals
and (iv) other standard employee benefits made generally available to all
employees (including any agreement providing for the issuance of Company
Shares, Company Stock Options or Company RSUs to such individuals).

 

4.29 Vote Required. Assuming the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 5.7 are true and correct, and that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL,
no vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Company
is necessary to adopt this Agreement or to approve and consummate the
Transactions.

4.30 Opinion of Financial Advisor. Prior to the execution of this Agreement,
the Company Board received an opinion from Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. to
the effect that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the
various qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Per Share Amount
to be received by holders of Common Stock (other than Parent, Purchaser and
their respective affiliates) pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, taken
together, is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (the
"Opinion"). The Company will deliver a written copy of such Opinion to
Purchaser solely for informational purposes promptly following the date
hereof.

5\. _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Purchaser._

Parent and Purchaser hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to
the Company that:

 



-54- 5.1 Corporate Organization. Each of Parent and Purchaser is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and, to the extent applicable, in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has the requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and Purchaser is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation
of the Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent and Purchaser from performing
any of their material obligations under this Agreement.

 

5.2 Authority Relative to this Agreement. Each of Parent and Purchaser has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
Parent and Purchaser and the consummation by Parent and Purchaser of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Purchaser
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions
(other than, with respect to the Merger, the filing and recordation of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Purchaser and, assuming
due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Purchaser,
enforceable against each of Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its terms,
except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now
or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally, and (ii) the
remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable
relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

5.3 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser will not,
(i) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
either Parent or Purchaser, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals,
authorizations and other actions described in Section 5.3(b) have been
obtained and all filings and obligations described in Section 5.3(b) have been
made, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or Purchaser or by
which any property or asset of either of them is bound or affected, or (iii)
result in any breach of, or constitute a default (or an event that, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default or breach) under, or
give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset
of Parent or Purchaser pursuant to, or result in the loss of a material
benefit under any Contract, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or Purchaser is a party or by which Parent or
Purchaser or any property or asset of either of them is bound or affected,
except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the

 



-55-  Transactions or otherwise prevent Parent and Purchaser from performing any
of their material obligations under this Agreement.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser will not,
require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with, or
notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (i) for applicable
requirements, if any, of (x) the Exchange Act and Blue Sky Laws, (y) the HSR
Act and similar requirements in foreign countries where a merger filing will
be necessary or advisable and (z) the filing and recordation of appropriate
merger documents as required by the DGCL, and (ii) where the failure to
obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such
filings or notifications, individually or in the aggregate, would not prevent
or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent
Parent or Purchaser from performing their material obligations under this
Agreement.

5.4 Financing. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete fully
executed copies of the commitment letter, dated as of March 17, 2015 between
Parent, Bank of America, N.A and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated , together with any related fee letter, engagement letter or
other agreement, including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to
such letter in effect on the date hereof (and with the understanding that
Parent shall have delivered to the Company only redacted forms of the fee
letter and the engagement letter) (collectively, the "Commitment Letter"),
pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions thereof each of the
parties thereto (other than Parent) have severally agreed to lend the amounts
set forth therein (the provision of such funds as set forth therein, the
"Financing") for the purposes set forth in such Commitment Letter. The
Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or
waived prior to the date of this Agreement, and the respective commitments
contained in the Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified or
rescinded in any respect as of the date of this Agreement. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and, to
the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now
or hereafter in effect, affecting creditors rights generally, and (ii) except
that the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any term, or a
failure of any condition, of the Commitment Letter to provide the Financing.
Assuming the satisfaction of the Tender Offer Conditions set forth in clauses
(iii)(d) and (iii)(e) of Annex A, Parent does not have any reasonable basis to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of the Commitment Letter to provide the Financing required to be
satisfied by it. There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements (other than customary fee letters, engagement letters
and confidentiality letters, redacted copies of which have been delivered to
the Company) relating to the commitments to provide the Financing to
consummate the Offer and the Merger. There are no conditions precedent or
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. Subject to the
terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter and assuming the satisfaction of
the Tender Offer Condition set forth in clause (iii)(d)(B), the net proceeds
contemplated from the

 



-56-  Financing, together with the cash and cash equivalents of Parent and
Purchaser, are and will be, in the aggregate, sufficient for the satisfaction
of all of Parents and Purchasers obligations under this Agreement,
including the payment of the aggregate Per Share Amount and Merger
Consideration and of all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred
by the parties in connection herewith. Parent has fully paid all commitment
fees or other fees required to be paid prior to the date of this Agreement
pursuant to the Commitment Letter.

5.5 Absence of Litigation. Except as disclosed in Section 5.5 of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule dated the date hereof and delivered by Parent to the
Company (the "Parent Disclosure Schedule"), there is no material Action
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent or Purchaser, threatened against
Parent, any subsidiary of Parent, or any property or asset of Parent or any
subsidiary of Parent, before any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction that is reasonably likely to prevent the consummation of any
Transaction or otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing their
material obligations under this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any subsidiary
of Parent nor any property or asset of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent is
subject to any material continuing Order of, consent decree, settlement
agreement or similar written agreement with, or, to the knowledge of Parent or
Purchaser, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction, or any Order of any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction that is reasonably likely to prevent consummation of
the Offer or the Merger or otherwise prevent Parent or Purchaser from
performing their material obligations under this Agreement.

5.6 Purchaser. All of the outstanding capital stock of Purchaser is owned
directly by Parent. Except for obligations or liabilities incurred in
connection with its incorporation or organization or the negotiation and
consummation of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the Transactions,
Purchaser has not incurred any obligations or liabilities, and has not
engaged in any business or activities of any type or kind whatsoever or
entered into any Contracts or arrangements with any person or entity.

 

5.7 Ownership of Company Capital Stock. Neither Parent nor Purchaser is, nor
at any time during the last three (3) years has it been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203(c) of the DGCL (other
than as contemplated by this Agreement). Prior to the date hereof, neither
Parent nor Purchaser has taken, or authorized or permitted
any Representatives of Parent or Purchaser to take, any action that would
reasonably be expected to cause, Parent, Purchaser or any of their
"affiliates" or "associates" to be deemed an "interested stockholder" as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL or otherwise render Section 251(h) of the
DGCL inapplicable to the Merger.

5.8 Vote Required. No vote of the holders of any of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this Agreement and the
Transactions.

 

5.9 Offer Documents; Schedule 14D-9. The Offer Documents shall not, at the
time the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC or are first published, sent
or given to stockholders of the Company, as the case may be, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The information supplied by Parent to the Company specifically
for inclusion in the

 



-57-  Schedule 14D-9 shall not, at the date first mailed to stockholders of the
Company contain any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not false or misleading, or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication that shall have become false or misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent and Purchaser make no representation or warranty with
respect to any information supplied by the Company or any of its
representatives for inclusion in any of the foregoing documents or the
Offer Documents. The information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the
Schedule 14D-9 and the Offer Documents shall comply in all material respects
as to form with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

Agreement and the Effective Time (i) the Company shall, and shall cause the

times to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices, plants and

 



-61-  other facilities, books and records of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary, including the Owned Company Intellectual Property, and shall
furnish Parent and Purchaser with such financial, operating and other data
and information (including the work papers of the Companys accountants) as
Parent or Purchaser, through their officers, employees and other
Representatives, may reasonably request as long as these actions are
in compliance with all applicable data privacy/protection Laws; _provided_ ,
that such disclosure shall not be required to include any information that is
subject to a statutory non-disclosure or similar provision or agreement with a
Governmental Authority; prime contractor, higher-tier subcontractor,
distributor, or other third party for end-use by a Governmental Authority
(collectively, "Governmental Contracting Parties"), or that is subject to an

its reasonable best efforts to secure the consent of the appropriate
Governmental Contracting Party to permit disclosure of such protected

obligations of the parties hereto or any condition to the Offer.

 

7.3 Solicitation of Transactions.

 

(a) Go-Shop Period. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and
continuing until 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the earlier of the

Start Date"), the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall have the right to: (i) initiate, solicit and encourage,
whether publicly or otherwise, Acquisition Proposals, including by way of
providing access to non-public information pursuant to one or
more confidentiality agreements that are on terms, with respect to the
maintenance of confidentiality of the Companys information, which are not
less restrictive in the aggregate to such person than such provisions of the
Confidentiality 

 



-62-  Agreement are to Parent; _provided_ , that the Company shall promptly
provide to Parent a copy of any material non-public information concerning the
Company or any Company Subsidiary that is provided to any Person given such
access which was not previously provided to Parent (or its Representatives);
and (ii) enter into and maintain discussions or negotiations with respect to

(i) Except as permitted by this Section 7.3 and except as may relate to any
Excluded Party, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and
each of its and their respective Representatives to (i) on the No-Shop Period
Start Date, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any
Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, and
require such Persons and any other Persons who have made or have indicated an
intention to make an Acquisition Proposal to promptly return or destroy any
confidential information previously furnished by the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives; and (ii) from
the No-Shop Period Start Date until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries shall not, nor shall they authorize or knowingly
permit any of their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly (i)
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any Acquisition
Proposal or the making thereof to the Company or its stockholders; (ii) enter
into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish any non-public information to, or otherwise cooperate in
any way with, any person (other than Parent, Purchaser and their

terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any contractual
"standstill," confidentiality or similar obligation of any person other than

customarily referred to as "dont ask" provisions); or (iv) take any action
to render any provision of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute
(including Section 203 of the DCGL) or any restrictive provision of any
applicable anti-takeover provision in the Companys organizational documents,
in each case inapplicable to any person (other than Parent, Purchaser or any
of their affiliates) or any Acquisition Proposal (and to the extent permitted
thereunder, the Company shall promptly take all steps necessary to terminate
any waiver that may have been heretofore granted to any such person
or Acquisition Proposal under any such provisions). Any breach of the
foregoing provisions of this Section 7.3 by any of the Company Subsidiaries or
the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries Representatives shall be deemed to
be a breach by the Company.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if at any time following
the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to the Acceptance Time, in response
to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) is, or is reasonably
likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and which Acquisition Proposal the
Company Board determines (after consultation with outside legal counsel) did
not result from or arise in connection with a breach of this Section 7.3(b)
and was made after the date hereof, the Company may, subject to compliance
with Section 7.3(d), (x) furnish information regarding the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the person 

 



-63-  making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement (which shall permit the Company to comply with the
terms of this Section 7.3(b) and Section 7.3(d)) containing confidentiality
and standstill provisions not less restrictive in the aggregate to such person
than such provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent;
_provided_ , that all such information has previously been provided to Parent
or is provided to Parent prior to or promptly following the time it is
provided to such person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives)
regarding such Acquisition Proposal, but only if and to the extent that in
connection with the foregoing clauses (x) and (y), the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel)
that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to result in a
breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
_provided_ , the Company shall not take any of the actions referred to in the
foregoing clauses (x) and (y) unless the Company shall have notified Parent
in writing at least two (2) business days prior to taking such action that it
intends to take such action and the basis hereunder therefor; _provided_
_further_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 7.3(a) or this Section 7.3(b) prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company will in any event be permitted to take any or all of the actions
described in clauses (x) and (y) above with respect to any Excluded Party. In
addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company may, to the extent the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action
would reasonably be expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, not enforce any confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party for the sole purpose of allowing the other party to such
agreement to submit an Acquisition Proposal, or with respect to another party
that has submitted an Acquisition Proposal, solely with respect to such
submission, that will constitute, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Superior Proposal, that did not, in each case, result from a breach by the
Company of this Section 7.3(b).

 

(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal, which did not result from or arise in
connection with a breach of this Section 7.3, made by a Third Party that, if
consummated, would result in such Third Partys (or its stockholders) owning,
directly or indirectly, greater than 50% of the equity securities of the
Company (or of the shares of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or
indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole and that (i) the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
its outside legal counsel to be more favorable from a financial point of view
to the Companys stockholders than the Offer and the Merger (taking into
account all terms and conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement,
including (1) any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to such offer or otherwise, (2) whether the proposal is reasonably
capable of being completed by such Third Party (taking into account, among
other things, the expectation of obtaining required regulatory approvals) and
(3) if financing is required, whether such financing is reasonably available
to the Third Party).

(c) (i) Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, until the earlier of
the Acceptance Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
the terms hereof, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:
(x) (A) fail to make pursuant to

 



-64-  Section 2.2(b), or withdraw, modify, amend or qualify or publicly propose to
withdraw, modify, amend or qualify, in any manner adverse to Parent or
Purchaser, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board or any
committee thereof of this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger (the "Company
Board Recommendation"), (B) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender
offer or exchange offer other than the Offer for the Company Common Stock
within ten (10) business days of the commencement of such offer, (C) approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal (any of the foregoing in clauses (A)-(C), a "Change in
Recommendation"), or (y) adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt or
recommend, or allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute
or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement
in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar Contract
constituting or related to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than
a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b)
(any of the foregoing, an "Acquisition Agreement").

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, the Company Board may at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time and solely in response to an Intervening Event, effect a
Change in Recommendation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may
not effect a Change in Recommendation unless the Company shall have provided
prior written notice to Parent at least four (4) business days in advance of
its intention to take such action, which notice shall specify the facts,
circumstances and other conditions giving rise thereto, and prior to effecting
such Change in Recommendation, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, during such four (4) business day period, negotiate with
Parent in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
Change in Recommendation is no longer necessary; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company Board shall not be permitted to effect a Change in
Recommendation pursuant to this Section 7.3(c)(ii) with respect to or
in connection with any Acquisition Proposal (which shall be covered by and
subject in all respects to Section 7.3(c)(iii)).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may in response to
an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) constitutes a Superior Proposal that was made after the
date of this Agreement and that (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of this
Section 7.3, (A) make a Change in Recommendation if the Company Board has
concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that, in light of the receipt of such Superior Proposal, that failure to make
such Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to result in a
breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or
(B) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g)
and concurrently with such termination enter into an Acquisition Agreement if
the Company Board has concluded in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that, in light of the receipt of such
Superior Proposal, that failure to so terminate this Agreement would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach by the Company Board of its
fiduciary duties under applicable

 



-65-  Law; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (B), and any purported termination
pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall be void and of no force or effect,
unless concurrently with such termination the Company pays by wire transfer of
immediately available funds the Termination Fee in accordance with Section
9.1(g); _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be entitled to
exercise its right to make a Change in Recommendation pursuant to this Section
7.3(c)(iii) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless the Company has:

(A) provided to Parent three (3) business days prior written notice that it
intends to take such action (a "Notice of Designated Superior Proposal"),
which notice shall describe the terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal
that is the basis of the proposed action by the Company Board (a "Designated
Superior Proposal") and attach the most current form or draft of any written
agreement providing for the transaction contemplated by such Designated
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Designated Superior Proposal with a new three (3)
business day notice period),

 

(B) during each such three (3) business day period, if requested by Parent,
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in
such a manner that the Acquisition Proposal that was determined to constitute
a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal, and

 

(C) at the end of such three (3) business day period, such Acquisition
Proposal has not been withdrawn and the Company Board determines in good
faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to or proposed
by Parent in response to a Notice of Designated Superior Proposal, as a result
of the negotiations required by clause (B) or otherwise).

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours of learning of the relevant information) advise Parent orally and in
writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (including for the
avoidance of doubt any request for information or other inquiry which the
Company would reasonably expect to lead to an Acquisition Proposal),
including the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal
(including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal and attaching a copy of any such written Acquisition
Proposal, or if such Acquisition Proposal is provided orally to the Company,
the Company shall summarize in writing the terms of such Acquisition Proposal
(including for the avoidance of doubt any such request or other inquiry). The
Company shall keep Parent informed on a prompt basis in all material respects
of the status and details (including any material change or proposed change to
the terms thereof) of any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) business
days of the commencement of any tender or exchange offer by a Third Party,
after receipt of a written request by Parent to provide such reaffirmation,
unless a Change in Recommendation is permitted by Section 7.3(c)(iii).

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 7.3 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) making any disclosure to the holders of Company Shares
if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that failure to make such disclosure would reasonably
be expected to result in a breach by the

 



-66-  Company Board of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law ( _provided_ that
each such disclosure shall include a public reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation), or (ii) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or making a
statement required under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or under Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
that any such disclosure, other than a "stop, look and listen" communication
of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, shall be
deemed to be a Change in Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly
publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such communication; and
_provided_ _further_ that this Section 7.3(e) shall not be deemed to permit
the Companys Board or any committee thereof to make a Change in
Recommendation except as expressly permitted by Section 7.3(c).

7.4 Employee Benefits Matters.

(a) If so directed by Parent in writing at least ten (10) days prior to the
initial scheduled expiration of the Offer, the Company Board will adopt (and
will cause any other sponsor of the applicable Plan to adopt), at least five
(5) business days prior to the initial scheduled expiration of the Offer,
resolutions terminating any and all Plans intended to qualify as a qualified
cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective no
later than the day immediately preceding the date the Company becomes a member
of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of
the Code) as Parent. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of Parent, and the Company shall provide
Parent evidence that such resolutions have been adopted by the Company Board
or the board of directors of the Company Subsidiaries or any other applicable
Plan sponsor, as applicable. The Company shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) plans as Parent may reasonably
request. 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and levels of benefits
(but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or frozen benefit
plan of Parent or vesting under any equity incentive plan) under any employee
benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries in which the
Continuing Employees participate ("Parent Plans"), Parent will credit each
Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the Company before
the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the
foregoing will not apply for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early
retirement benefits or to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, Parent will, subject in each case to receipt of any required consent
of the applicable Plan provider, cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
Parent Plans, (ii) for purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent
Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived under
the comparable Plans in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) for the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs, the crediting of each Continuing Employee with any
co-payments and 

 



-67-  deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent Plan.

 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall (x) create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) or service provider or former service provider (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
in any respect, including in respect of continued employment (or
resumed employment), or create any such rights in any such persons in respect
of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Plan
or any employee or service provider program or arrangement of Parent or any of
its subsidiaries (including any Plan of the Company prior to the Effective
Time), or (y) constitute or be construed to constitute an amendment to any of
the compensation or benefit plans maintained for or provided to employees or
other persons prior to or following the Effective Time. Nothing in this
Agreement shall constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or
terminate any such plans or arrangements of Parent or any of its subsidiaries
(including any Plan of the Company prior to the Effective Time).

(d) If the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries enters into, adopts,
amends, modifies or terminates any Company Arrangement, all such amounts
payable under such Company Arrangement shall (i) be paid or granted as
compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed, or
future services to be refrained from performing, by the
Covered Securityholders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) shall not
be calculated based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into
the Offer by the applicable Covered Securityholder. Moreover, the Company
shall take all actions necessary so that, prior to the Expiration Date: (i)
the adoption, approval, amendment or modification of each such Company
Arrangement shall be approved as an employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement solely by independent directors of the
Company in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d10(d)(2) under the
Exchange Act and the instructions thereto and (ii) the "safe harbor" provided
pursuant to Rule 14d10(d)(2) is otherwise applicable thereto as a result of
the taking prior to the Expiration Date of all necessary actions by the
Company Board, the Company Compensation Committee or its independent
directors.

 

7.5 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company pursuant to any indemnification, exculpation or advance of expense or
similar agreement by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in favor of any
present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the
Company and any Company Subsidiary (the "Indemnification Agreements") (and
all other indemnification agreements of the Company that are on terms
substantially similar to the Indemnification Agreements) and any
indemnification, exculpation or advancement of expenses provisions under the
Certificate of Incorporation or Company Bylaws as in effect immediately prior
to the Acceptance Time; _provided_ , that such obligations shall be subject to
any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable Law.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and for six (6) years
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to,

 



-68-  provide officers and directors liability, fiduciary liability and similar
insurance (collectively, "DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each Indemnified Person
covered as of the date of this Agreement by the Companys DandO Insurance
policies on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than
those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement as well as
covering claims brought against each Indemnified Person under ERISA;
_provided_ , that, in satisfying its obligation under this Section 7.5(b) the
Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in the
aggregate in excess of 200% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its
last full fiscal year, which amount the Company has disclosed to Parent prior
to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, and prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company may, with the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), purchase a "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy, covering the same
persons and providing the same terms with respect to coverage and premium
amount as aforesaid, and that by its terms shall provide coverage until the
sixth annual anniversary of the Effective Time, and upon the purchase of such
insurance Parents and the Surviving Corporations obligations pursuant to the
first sentence of this Section 7.5(b) shall be deemed satisfied for so long as
such insurance is in full force and effect and covers the matters that would
otherwise be covered pursuant to this Section 7.5(b).

(c) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.5 shall
survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.5.

 

7.6 Anti-Takeover Statutes. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and Company Board
shall grant such approval and take such action as necessary so that such
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

7.7 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent and Purchaser in writing of: (i) any representation or warranty made
by the Company contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such
that the conditions set forth in clause (iii)(d) of Annex A would not be
satisfied or (x) any failure of the Company to comply with any covenant or
agreement to be complied with by it under this Agreement such that the
conditions set forth in clause (iii)(e) of Annex A would not be satisfied; and
(ii) the occurrence or existence of any Effect that, individually or in
the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company in

 



-69-  writing of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Purchaser
contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, or any failure of
Parent or Purchaser to comply with any covenant or agreement to be complied
with by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the failure to so
comply or the becoming untrue or incorrect would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise
prevent Parent or Purchaser from performing their material obligations under
this Agreement.

7.8 Litigation. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties of
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation that shall be instituted or
threatened in writing against such party to restrain, prohibit or otherwise
challenge the legality of or seek damages in connection with this Agreement
or any Transaction. Each party hereto shall promptly notify the others of any
action, suit, proceeding or investigation that is instituted or threatened in
writing against the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, Purchaser or
Parent, as the case may be, that would have been listed in Section 4.9 of the
Disclosure Schedule or Section 5.6 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the
case may be, if such action, suit, proceeding or investigation had arisen
prior to the date hereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to
participate at Parents expense in (but not control) the defense or settlement
of any stockholder litigation or claims against the Company or any of its
directors relating to the Offer or the Merger, in each case which seek to
prohibit or restrain the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall
not settle or make an offer to settle any litigation against the Company or
any director by any stockholder relating to this Agreement, the Offer or the
Merger, without the prior written consent of Parent.

7.9 Consents and Approvals.

 

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly (x) prepare and file all necessary documentation and (y) effect
all applications, notices, petitions and filings (including, to the extent
necessary, any notification required by the HSR Act, as more
specifically addressed in Section 7.10) and (z) obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities
that are reasonably deemed necessary or advisable to consummate the
Transactions. The Company shall also use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain all consents required to be listed on Section 4.5(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule. The parties hereto shall consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations, and
each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the Transactions. Parent and the Company shall each, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts
to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions. Parent and the Company,
with respect to any threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction
or other Order or Law that would adversely affect the ability of the parties
hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, shall use
reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry, enactment or promulgation
thereof, as the case may be.

(b) Parent and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of any of the Transactions relating to any such
consent or approval.

any Governmental Authority in connection with such proceedings under or
relating to the HSR Act or any foreign or other antitrust Law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this
Agreement shall require Parent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates to,
and, except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not
take any action to and shall not allow any of the Company Subsidiaries to,
consent or proffer to divest, hold separate, or enter into any license or
similar Contract with respect to, or agree to restrict the ownership or

their respective subsidiaries, in each case as a result of or in connection
with the Offer or the Merger, (iii) seeking, directly or indirectly,
to impose or confirm limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its

contemplated by this Agreement without delay; (ii) comply without delay with
all covenants, and satisfy without delay all conditions, required to be
complied with or satisfied by Parent or Purchaser in the Commitment Letter
and in such definitive agreements; (iii) cause the Financing to be consummated
at such time or from time to time as is necessary for Parent and Purchaser to
satisfy their respective obligations under this Agreement; (iv) pay any and
all commitment or other fees in a timely manner that become payable by Parent
or Purchaser under the Commitment Letter following the date of this Agreement,
to the extent that the failure to pay such fees would be reasonably expected
to adversely impact the availability of the financing thereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent and Purchaser shall not be required to, and Parent and
Purchaser shall not be required to cause any other person to, commence,
participate in, pursue or defend any Action against or involving any of the
persons that have committed to provide any portion of, or otherwise with
respect to, the Financing. In the event any portion of the Financing becomes
or would reasonably be expect to become unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter for any reason or the
Commitment Letter shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially
adverse to Parent or Purchaser for any reason, Parent and Purchaser shall
promptly so notify the Company, and shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, and in no event later than the
Outside Date, from the same and/or alternative financing sources alternative
financing on terms not materially less favorable to Parent and Purchaser than
the

 



-73-  terms of the Financing in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) an amount
sufficient to consummate the Offer and the Merger and the other Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into consideration the funds
otherwise available to Parent and Purchaser), and (ii) the amount of financing
that was contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the date of this Agreement.
In the event any alternative or substitute financing is obtained by Parent
and Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Section 7.17(a) (the
"Alternative Financing"), references in this Agreement to the Financing
(including, for avoidance of doubt, the references in this Section 7.17 and
Section 1.1, but excluding references in Section 5.4 shall be deemed to refer
to the Alternative Financing, and if a new financing commitment letter is
entered into in connection with such Alternative Financing (the "New
Commitment Letter"), references in this Agreement to the Commitment Letter
(including, for avoidance of doubt, the references in this Section 7.17, but
excluding the references in Section 5.4 and clause (ii) of the preceding
sentence) shall be deemed to refer to the New Commitment Letter. Parent and
Purchaser will provide the Company with a copy of any New Commitment Letter
obtained by Parent or Purchaser in connection with an Alternative Financing
as promptly as practicable following the execution thereof.

(b) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to all
material activity concerning the status of the Financing, including the status
of Parents and Purchasers efforts to comply with their respective covenants
under, and satisfy the conditions contemplated by, the Commitment Letter and
shall give the Company prompt notice of any event or change that would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the ability of
Parent or Purchaser to consummate the Financing. Neither Parent nor Purchaser
shall, without the prior written consent of the Company, amend, supplement or
otherwise modify, or grant any waivers under, the Commitment Letter in any
manner (including by way of a side letter or other binding agreement,
arrangement or understanding) that would: (A) expand in any material respect,
or amend, supplement or otherwise modify in a manner materially adverse to
Parent and Purchaser, the conditions to the Financing set forth in the
Commitment Letter; (B) prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation
of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (C) subject to Parents
and Purchasers right to obtain substitute financing set forth in Section
7.17(a), reduce the aggregate amount of financing set forth in the Commitment
Letter to an amount below the amount needed (in combination with all funds
held by or otherwise available to Parent and Purchaser) to consummate the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall not release
or consent to the termination of the obligations of the lenders under the
Commitment Letter, except for assignments and replacements of an individual
lender under the terms of or in connection with the syndication of the
Commitment Letter in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect the ability of Parent or Purchaser to
consummate the Financing without delay.

 

(c) The Company shall provide, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and
the representatives of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to provide,
at Parents sole cost and expense, all reasonable cooperation in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing as may be requested by Parent or
Purchaser and that is necessary or customary or desirable in connection
with Parents and Purchasers efforts to obtain the Financing, including (i)
participation by senior management in meetings, drafting sessions and due
diligence sessions at times and in locations reasonably acceptable to the
Company, (ii) furnishing Parent and Purchaser and their representatives with
all financial and other material information of the

 



-74-  Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including all information contemplated
by the Commitment Letter to be delivered after the date of this Agreement, as
is necessary or customary in connection with the Financing, in each case, as
and when it becomes available; (iii) assisting Parent and its Financing
Sources in the preparation of syndication documents and materials, information
memoranda, lender presentations and similar documents and materials, in
connection with the Financing, including providing customary authorization
letters related thereto, (iv) assisting in the preparation of definitive
financing documents, as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (v)
facilitating the pledging of collateral for the Financing, (vi) using
commercially reasonably efforts to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations and instruments which may be reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the Financing and collateral arrangements, including, without
limitation, customary payoff letters, releases of liens, instruments of
termination or discharge, legal opinions, surveys and title insurance, (vii)
using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the syndication efforts
for the Financing benefit materially from the Companys existing lending and
banking relationships, (viii) using commercially reasonable efforts in
assisting Parent and Purchaser in their efforts to obtain corporate credit or
family ratings of Parent; (ix) as promptly as practicable after request
thereof, furnishing the Financing Sources with reasonable documents or other
information requested by the Financing Sources relating to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries required by bank regulatory authorities with respect to
the Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2011, and (x)
facilitating the consummation of the Financing, including cooperating with
Parent to satisfy the conditions precedent to the Financing to the extent
within the control of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and taking all
corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time,
reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser to permit the consummation of the
Financing; provided that neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall
be required to pay any commitment or any other fee in connection with the
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall
ensure that all financial and other projections concerning the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries that are made available to Parent and Purchaser after
the date of this Agreement are prepared in good faith. The Company agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to cause its Company
Subsidiaries to provide, any items requested and set forth in clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) above no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the initial
Expiration Date to the extent practicable and to the extent that reasonable
prior notice of such request shall have been provided by Parent and
Purchaser. The Company consents to the use of its logos in connection with
the Financing.

(d) Any breach of the Commitment Letter, any definitive agreement with
respect to the Financing, any commitment letter with respect to the
Alternative Financing or any definitive agreement with respect to any
Alternative Financing by Parent, in each case that materially and adversely
affects the ability of Parent or Purchaser to obtain the Financing, shall be
deemed a breach by Parent of this Section 7.17. Each of Parent and Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the Financing or any
Alternative Financing, nor the completion of any issuance of securities
contemplated by the Financing or any Alternative Financing, is a condition to
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, and reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and
independent of the availability of the Financing or any Alternative Financing,
or the completion of any such issuance, subject to the Tender Offer Conditions
and the applicable conditions set forth in Section 8.1. Parent and Purchaser
acknowledge and agree that the Company and its

 



-75-  affiliates and its and their respective Representatives shall not have any
responsibility for, or incur any liability to any person under, any financing
that Parent and Purchaser may raise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided pursuant to this
Section 7.17 and that, except in cases involving fraud or intentional
misrepresentation on the part of the Company or any of its affiliates or any
of its or their respective Representatives, Parent and Purchaser shall, on a
joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
affiliates and its and their respective Representatives from and against any
and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by
any of them as a result of any Action against any of such parties arising out
of any acts performed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary at Parents or
Purchasers request under this Section 7.17. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Company (and any of its shareholders, partners, members,
affiliates, directors, officers, employees or agents) shall not have any
rights or claims against any Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement or the Commitment Letter, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise.

(b) By either Parent, Purchaser or the Company, if:

 

(i) the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or before July 17, 2015
(the "Outside Date" );  _provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any
party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been
the substantial or primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure of such
acceptance to occur on or before such date; or,

 



-76- (ii) the Offer (as it may have been extended pursuant to Section 2.1(d))
expires as a result of the non-satisfaction of one or more Tender Offer
Conditions in a circumstance where Purchaser has no further obligation to
extend the Offer pursuant to Section 2.1(d); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(b)(ii) shall not be

(iii) any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have
enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Order that (x) makes
acceptance for payment of, or payment for, the Company Shares pursuant to the
Offer or consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibited, or (y)
enjoins Purchaser from accepting for payment, or paying for, the Company
Shares pursuant to the Offer or Parent and the Company from consummating the
Merger, and, in each case, such order, injunction, judgment, judicial
decision, decree or ruling or Law shall have become final and non-appealable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
shall have used its reasonable best efforts to have such Order avoided or
lifted; or

(c) By either Parent or Purchaser, if there is an inaccuracy in the Companys
representations herein, or a breach by the Company of its covenants herein, in
either case such that the events set forth in Sections (iii)(d) or (iii)(e) of
Annex A shall have occurred; _provided_ , _however_ , if such breach or
inaccuracy is capable of being cured prior to the earlier of (A) the Outside

inaccuracy or (y) following such date if such inaccuracy or breach is cured
at or prior to such date; or

(d) By either Parent or Purchaser, if following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, there shall have occurred a Material Adverse Effect that is

(e) By either Parent or Purchaser, if any of the following shall have

(iii) the Company shall have failed to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or to permit Parent to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents (it being agreed that the
delivery of a Notice of Designated Superior Proposal and any amendment or
update to such notice and the determination to so deliver such notice, update
or amendment and public disclosure with respect thereto shall not, by itself,
give rise to a right for Parent to terminate this Agreement); or

 



-77- (f) By the Company, if there is an inaccuracy in the Parents or Purchasers
representations herein, or a breach by Parent or Purchaser of its covenants
herein, in either case that would reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse to the Parents or Purchasers ability to purchase and pay for the
Company Shares (assuming all Company Shares were validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer); _provided_ , _however_ , if such breach or
inaccuracy is capable of being cured prior to the earlier of (A) the Outside
Date and (B) the date that is twenty (20) business days from the date Parent
is notified in writing by the Company of such breach, the Company may not
terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(f) (x) prior to such date
if Parent and Purchaser are taking reasonable efforts to cure such breach or
inaccuracy and (y) following such date if such inaccuracy or breach is cured
at or prior to such date; or

 

(g) By the Company in order to enter into an Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 7.3;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event of any termination of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) the Company shall pay to Parent the
Termination Fee payable under Section 9.3(a)(iii) concurrently with such
termination. Any purported termination pursuant to this Section 9.1(g) that is
not in strict compliance with the requirements of this Section 9.1(g) shall be

pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and
there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or
their respective officers, directors, stockholders, or affiliates; _provided_
, that, (a) Section 7.2(b) (Confidentiality), Section 7.14 (Public
Announcements), Section 9.3 (Fees), Section 10 (General Provisions) and this
Section 9.2 shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination
of this Agreement, and (b) such termination shall not relieve any party from
liability for any fraud or willful breach of its representations or warranties
or covenants hereunder. A termination of this Agreement shall not cause a
termination of the Confidentiality Agreement or any other agreement between
the parties.

9.3 Fees.

 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 

(i) by Parent, Purchaser or the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) or
9.1(b)(ii) and (x) an Acquisition Proposal by a Third Party shall have been
publicly announced after the date hereof and prior to such termination and (y)
within 12 months after such termination (A) the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (B) an
Acquisition Proposal is consummated (with all references to 20% in the
definition thereof being treated as references to 50.1% for purposes of this
Section 9.3(a));

 

(ii) by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1(e); or

 

(iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(g);

 

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee,
which amount shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
The Termination Fee shall be paid

 



-78-  (x) in the circumstances described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, promptly
(but in no event later than one (1) business day) following the first to occur
of the events giving rise to the obligation to make such payment and (y) in
the circumstances described in clause (iii) above, concurrently with and as a
condition to the termination. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
the Company be obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion.

(b) Subject to Section 9.3(c) below, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Support Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not any
Transaction is consummated.

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(c) and
neither Parent nor Purchaser is in material breach of their respective
agreements contained in this Agreement or their respective representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company shall reimburse each of
Parent and Purchaser and their affiliates for all out-of-pocket expenses and
fees (including fees and expenses payable to all banks, investment banking
firms, other financial institutions and other persons and their respective
agents and counsel, for arranging, committing to provide or providing any
financing for the Transactions or structuring the Transactions and all fees
and expenses of counsel, accountants, experts and consultants to Parent and
Purchaser, and all printing and advertising expenses) actually incurred or
accrued by either of them or on their behalf in connection with the
Transactions, including the financing thereof, and actually incurred or
accrued by banks, investment banking firms, other financial institutions and
other persons and assumed by Parent or Purchaser in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement,
the structuring and financing of the Transactions and any financing
commitments or agreements relating thereto in an amount not to exceed Three
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,500,000) (all the foregoing being
referred to herein collectively as the "Expenses"). The Expenses shall be paid
by wire transfer of immediately available funds promptly following submission
of statements therefore. Such payment shall be in addition to, and not in
lieu of, all rights and remedies Parent and Purchaser may have in such
circumstances under this Agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent
and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its affiliates
that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Purchaser in the
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunity forgone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. The Company acknowledges and hereby
agrees that the provisions of this Section 9.3 are an integral part of the
Transactions, and that, without such provisions, Parent would not have entered
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company shall fail to pay the
Termination Fee when due, the term "Termination Fee" shall be deemed to
include the costs and expenses incurred or accrued by Parent and Purchaser
(including fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection
under and enforcement of this Section 9.3, together with interest on such
unpaid Termination Fee, commencing on the date that the Termination Fee became
due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by
Citibank, N.A. from time to time, in the City of New York, as such banks
Base Rate plus 5%. Similarly, if the

 



-79-  Company shall fail to pay the Expenses when due, the term "Expenses", as
applicable, shall be deemed to include the costs and expenses incurred or
accrued by Parent and Purchaser (including fees and expenses of counsel) in
connection with the collection under and enforcement of this Section 9.3,
together with interest on such unpaid Expenses, commencing on the date that
the Expenses became due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest publicly
announced by Citibank, N.A. from time to time, in the City of New York, as
such banks Base Rate plus 5%.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that Parents right
to receive payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 9.3, in
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable, shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Purchaser and their
respective affiliates and any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors,
trustees, officers, employees, agents or affiliates (the "Parent Related
Parties") against the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective affiliates and any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors,
officers, employees, agents or Affiliates (collectively, the "Company Related
Parties") for all any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
fees, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements),
judgments, inquiries and fines suffered in respect of this Agreement
(including in respect of any breach, whether or not willful and intentional,
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or the failure of the
Merger to be consummated) or the Transactions in such circumstances, and upon
payment of the Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to this Section 9.3, none of
the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation to
any of the Parent Related Parties relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transactions.

10\. _General Provisions._

 

10.1 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of the Company, Parent and Purchaser contained in this Agreement

_[Signature Page to Agreement and Plan of Merger]_ _ANNEX A _

 

 _Conditions to the Offer_

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, but subject to the terms of
this Agreement and in addition to (and not in limitation of) Purchasers
right to extend or amend the Offer at any time pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be required to accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, pay
for any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer if:

(i) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Minimum Condition
shall not have been satisfied (and such Minimum Condition shall not be waived
or amended by Parent or Purchaser),

(ii) any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall not have expired
or been terminated prior to the expiration of the Offer or any other required
consents or approvals of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction
the absence of which would reasonably be expected to dilute materially the
anticipated benefits to Parent of the Transaction, shall not have expired,
been obtained or been terminated, as the case may be, prior to the expiration
of the Offer, or

 

(iii) immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer, any of the following
conditions shall exist:

 

(a) there shall have been instituted any Action, which is pending, by any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction:

 

(i) challenging or seeking to make illegal or otherwise, directly or
indirectly, restrain or prohibit, the acceptance for payment, payment for or
purchase of any Company Shares by Parent or Purchaser, or the consummation of
the Offer or the Merger;

(ii) seeking, in connection with the Transactions, to require Company, Parent
or Purchaser to take a Burdensome Action;

(iii) seeking to impose or confirm any material limitation on the ability of
Parent or Purchaser to acquire, hold or exercise effectively full rights of
ownership of any Company Shares, including the right to vote any Company
Shares acquired by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer or otherwise on all
matters properly presented to the Companys stockholders;

(iv) seeking to require divestiture by Parent or Purchaser of any Company
Shares; or

(v) that otherwise (individually or in the aggregate with all other such
Actions) would have, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect;

 



A-1 (b) there shall have been any action taken, or any Law enacted, entered,
enforced, promulgated, amended, issued or deemed applicable to (i) Parent,
the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of Parent or the Company or (ii)
the Offer or the Merger, in each case by any Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction, that is reasonably likely to result, directly or
indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in clause (a) above;

(c) any Effect since the date hereof shall have occurred that has had, or is
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect, and such Effect shall be
continuing;

 

(d) (A) any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, other than Sections 4.3(b)(i), 4.3(b)(iv), 4.3(b)(v), 4.3(b)(vi)
and 4.3(b)(vii), 4.3(c), 4.4(a) and 4.4(b), shall not be true and correct
(without giving effect to any qualification as to "materiality" or "Material
Adverse Effect" set forth therein) as of immediately prior to the expiration
of the Offer as though made on or as of such date (other than those
representations and warranties that address matters only as of a particular
date or only with respect to a specified period of time, which need only be
true and correct as of such date or with respect to such period), except, in
each case, where the failure of such representations and warranties to be true
and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (B) any
representation or warranty of the Company set forth in Section 4.3(b)(i),
4.3(b)(iv), 4.3(b)(v), 4.3(b)(vi) or 4.3(b)(vii), or 4.3(c) shall not be true
and correct in all material respects as of the date of such representation
and warranty (which for purposes hereof shall be deemed satisfied, and such
representations and warranties shall be deemed true and correct in all
material respects, so long as any inaccuracy or combination of inaccuracies
in such representations and warranties does not result, in aggregate, in an
increase in the aggregate consideration otherwise payable by Purchaser in the
Offer and the Merger by more than $350,000), and (C) any representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in Section 4.4(a) or 4.4(b) shall not be
true and correct in all respects as of immediately prior to the expiration of
the Offer as though made on or as of such date;

 

(e) the Company shall have failed to comply with or perform in any material
respect any covenants, obligations or agreements of the Company under this
Agreement and such failure shall not have been cured; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that following any extension of the Offer by Purchaser pursuant to Section
2.1(i), the Tender Offer Condition contemplated by this clause (e) shall be
deemed to have been satisfied so long as the Company shall not have engaged in
an Intentional Breach of any of its covenants, obligations or agreements under
this Agreement required to be performed prior to the expiration of the Offer
and such Intentional Breach shall not have been cured;

(f) the Company shall not have furnished Parent with a certificate dated
as of the date of determination signed on its behalf by any of the Companys
chairman of the board of directors or its chief executive officer or such
other officer serving in such capacity to the effect that the conditions set
forth in clauses (d) and (e) of this Annex A shall not have occurred; or

(g) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms or
the Offer shall have been terminated in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement.

 



A-2 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and Parent and
subject to the terms of the Agreement and rules and regulations of the SEC,
may be asserted by Purchaser or Parent regardless of the circumstances giving
rise to any such condition or may be waived by Purchaser or Parent in whole or
in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion,
_provided_ , that the Minimum Condition may not be waived, in each case,
subject to the terms of the Agreement and the rules and regulations of the
SEC. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right; the waiver of
any such right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances shall
not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances; and
each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any
time and from time to time.

For purposes of this Agreement, there shall be deemed to be an "Intentional
Breach" by the Company of a covenant, obligation or agreement under this
Agreement only if: (i) such covenant, obligation or agreement is material to
Parent and Purchaser; (ii) the Company shall have willfully breached such
covenant, obligation or agreement; and (iii) the Company employee or
representative taking the action, failing to take the action, or authorizing
(or failing to authorize) the action, as the case may be, giving rise to the
breach of such covenant, obligation or agreement shall have had actual
knowledge, at the time of the Companys breach of such covenant, obligation or
agreement, that such action (or failure to act) was a breach of such
covenant, obligation or agreement under this Agreement.

The capitalized terms used in this Annex A shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is attached.
