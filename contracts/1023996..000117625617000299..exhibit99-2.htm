each case as amended. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
or withholding was made, provided that such deducted or withheld amounts are
actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. The Person is hereby
authorized to withhold and sell, or otherwise require the other Person to

withholding requirement and the Person shall notify the other Person and remit
the applicable portion of the net proceeds of such sale to the appropriate
taxing authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Person shall not withhold
securities where the other Person has made arrangements to satisfy any
withholding taxes, in advance, to the satisfaction of the Person.

relate to, and is not in response to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) a Material
Adverse Effect has occurred with respect to Richmont or Alamos, as applicable,
and (iii) the Richmont Board or Alamos Board, as applicable, determines in
good faith after consulting with outside counsel (which may include opinions

received after the date hereof that constitutes or that may reasonably be
expected to lead to a Richmont Superior Proposal or Alamos Superior Proposal,
as applicable, and the Richmont Board or Alamos Board, as applicable, may make
a Richmont Change in Recommendation or Alamos Change in Recommendation, as
applicable, in respect of, approve or recommend to the Richmont Shareholders
or Alamos Shareholders, as applicable, or enter into an agreement,
understanding or arrangement in respect of a Richmont Superior Proposal or
Alamos Superior Proposal, as applicable, in accordance with the provisions of

Richmont Superior Proposal or Alamos Superior Proposal, as applicable, did not
result from, or arise in connection with, a breach of this Agreement by
Richmont or Alamos, as applicable, and Richmont or Alamos, as applicable, is
in compliance with its obligations under Article 6 of this Agreement or any
agreement between the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and Richmont or
Alamos, as applicable; (II) the Richmont Board or Alamos Board, as applicable,
unanimously determines in good faith after consulting with outside counsel
(which may include opinions or advice, written or otherwise) that failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Richmont Board or Alamos Board, as applicable, under applicable Laws; and
(III) prior to entering into substantive discussions or negotiations with or
responding to any person regarding such Acquisition Proposal, Richmont or
Alamos, as applicable notifies the other Party of the good faith determination
of the Richmont Board or Alamos Board, as applicable, that such Acquisition
Proposal is or may reasonably be expected to lead to a Richmont Superior

75

  

terminate and cease any discussions or negotiations with any parties (other
than the other Party and its Representatives) with respect to any proposal
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to constitute, an Acquisition
Proposal. Richmont and Alamos shall, and shall cause the Richmont Subsidiaries
or Alamos Subsidiaries, as applicable, and their respective Representatives
to: (i) discontinue or not allow access to any of Richmont's or the Richmont
Subsidiaries' or Alamos' or the Alamos Subsidiaries' confidential information
to any third party and (ii) within one Business Day following the date of this
Agreement, request the return or destruction of all information provided to
any third party that has entered into a confidentiality agreement with
Richmont or any Richmont Subsidiary or Alamos or any Alamos Subsidiary
relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal to the extent that such
information has not previously been returned or destroyed, and shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such requests are honoured.
Richmont and Alamos agree not to, and shall cause the Richmont Subsidiaries or
Alamos Subsidiaries, as applicable, and their respective Representatives not
to: (A) release any third party from any confidentiality obligations contained
in any agreement relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal to which such
third party is a party; or (B) waive any provision of, or release or
terminate, any non-solicitation, standstill or purpose or use agreement or
provision or similar agreements, provisions or restrictions contained in any
confidentiality, non-disclosure, standstill or other agreements without the
prior written consent of the other Party (which may be withheld or delayed in
the other Party's sole and absolute discretion). Richmont and Alamos also
agree not to, and to cause the Richmont Subsidiaries or Alamos Subsidiaries,
as applicable, not to, amend, modify or waive any such confidentiality, non-
solicitation or standstill agreement or provision and undertakes to enforce,
or cause the Richmont Subsidiaries or Alamos Subsidiaries, as applicable, to
enforce, such agreements and provisions.

Each Party shall notify the other Party, at first orally and then, as soon as
possible thereafter, in writing, promptly and, in any event, within twenty
four (24) hours of the receipt by it, a Richmont Subsidiary or Alamos
Subsidiary, as applicable, or any of its respective Representatives, of any
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment thereto, or any request for non-public
information relating to Richmont or any of the Richmont Subsidiaries or Alamos
or any of the Alamos Subsidiaries, as applicable, in connection with any
potential Acquisition Proposal or for access to the properties, books or
records of Richmont or Alamos or any of the Richmont Subsidiaries or Alamos
Subsidiaries, as applicable, by any Person (other than in the ordinary course
of business and unrelated to any potential Acquisition Proposal). Such notice
shall include a description of the terms and conditions of, and the identity
of the Person making, any Acquisition Proposal, amendment or request. Each
Party shall also promptly provide the other Party with (i) a copy of any
written notice or other written communication from any Person informing
Richmont or Alamos or any of the Richmont Subsidiaries or Alamos Subsidiaries,
as applicable, or any of its respective Representatives that such Person is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) a copy of
any Acquisition Proposal (or any amendment thereto) received by Richmont or
Alamos or any of the Richmont Subsidiaries or Alamos Subsidiaries, as
applicable, or a Representative thereof. Each Party shall keep the other Party
informed of the status of any Acquisition Proposal

        |    |   
    
  

  

76

  

and keep the other Party fully informed as to the material details of all
discussions or negotiations with respect thereto.

         (d)   |    |   

If Richmont or Alamos, as applicable, is in compliance with its obligations
under Sections 6.1(a) through (c) and receives a request for material non-
public information from a Person who is considering making or has made a
written Acquisition Proposal (the existence and content of which have been
disclosed to the other Party), and the Richmont Board or Alamos Board, as
applicable, determines that such proposal constitutes or may reasonably be
expected to lead to a Richmont Superior Proposal or Alamos Superior Proposal,
as applicable, subject to and as contemplated under this Section 6.1, then,
and only in such case, the Richmont Board or Alamos Board, as applicable, may
provide such Person with access to information regarding Richmont and the
Richmont Subsidiaries or Alamos and the Alamos Subsidiaries, as applicable;
provided, however, that (i) Richmont or Alamos, as applicable, shall have
entered into a confidentiality and standstill agreement with such Person
containing confidentiality, purpose, use, non-solicitation and standstill
provisions that are no less restrictive than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreements (however, such confidentiality and standstill
agreement may permit such Person to make a non-public Acquisition Proposal to
the Richmont Board or Alamos Board, as applicable, in compliance with the
terms of this Agreement); (ii) the other Party is provided with a complete
list or copies of any and all information provided to such Person on a timely
basis (unless such information was previously provided to the other Party);
and (iii) the other Party is provided with prompt and similar access to such
information (unless such information was previously provided to the other
Party).

Each of Richmont and Alamos shall ensure that the Richmont Subsidiaries or
Alamos Subsidiaries, as applicable, and their respective Representatives are
aware of the provisions of this Section 6.1, and Richmont or Alamos, as
applicable, shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 6.1 by the
Richmont Subsidiaries or Alamos Subsidiaries, as applicable, or their
Representatives.

        |    |    

        | (v)   |   

in the event of a Richmont Superior Proposal, Richmont has provided Alamos
with written notice promptly following the Richmont Board's determination,
that (x) the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Richmont Superior Proposal,
and (y) the Richmont Board intends to accept, approve, recommend or enter into
any agreement with respect to such Richmont Superior Proposal, and a period
(the "Alamos Response Period") of five Business Days has elapsed from the date

the Arrangement in order to determine, in good faith and in a manner
consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Richmont Board or the Alamos
Board, as applicable, whether the proposed amendment by Alamos or Richmont, as
applicable, upon acceptance by Richmont or Alamos, as applicable, would result
in the Acquisition Proposal not being a Richmont Superior Proposal or Alamos
Superior Proposal, as applicable. If the Richmont Board or Alamos Board, as
applicable, so determines, Richmont or Alamos, as applicable, shall enter into
an amended agreement with Alamos or Richmont, as applicable, reflecting the

Proposal which has been publicly announced is not a Richmont Superior Proposal

applicable, has so amended the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement.
The Party not required by this Section 6.2(d) to issue such press release and

the form and content of any such press release, recognizing that whether or
not such comments are appropriate will be determined by the other Party,

the 

        |    |       
  

  

79

  

Richmont Meeting or Alamos Meeting, as applicable, at the Richmont Meeting or
Alamos Meeting, as applicable (but not beforehand without the other Party's
consent), to a date acceptable to the other Party, acting reasonably, which

         (a)   |    |   

this Agreement is terminated by either Alamos or Richmont pursuant to Section
7.2(i); 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

     (b)   |    |   

this Agreement is terminated by either Alamos or Richmont pursuant to Section
7.2(j); or 

        |    |    

     (c)   |    |   

this Agreement is terminated by either Alamos or Richmont pursuant to Section
7.2(f) or Section 7.2(g), as applicable, and prior to such termination an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to Richmont or Alamos, as
applicable, and made known to Richmont Shareholders or Alamos Shareholders, as
applicable, generally or shall have been made directly to Richmont
Shareholders or Alamos Shareholders, as applicable, generally or any Person
shall have publicly announced an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal (a
"Pending Acquisition Proposal"), and such Pending Acquisition Proposal or
announced intention shall not have been publicly withdrawn prior to the
Richmont Meeting or Alamos Meeting, as applicable, and within nine (9) months
following the termination of this Agreement Richmont or Alamos, as applicable,
completes an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not with the Person who made the
Pending Acquisition Proposal) (provided that, for the purpose of this Section
6.3(c), all references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal"
shall be deemed to be references to "50%"), 

  

then Richmont or Alamos, as applicable, shall pay to the other Party in any of
the circumstances set forth in Sections 6.3(a) or 6.3(b), at the time of the
termination of this Agreement and, in the circumstances set forth in Section
6.3(c), within one day following the completion of such Acquisition Proposal,
an amount in cash equal to $35,000,000 (the "Termination Payment"), in
immediately available funds. Neither Party shall be obligated to make more
than one payment pursuant to this Section 6.3. Each Party hereby acknowledges
that the Termination Payment is a payment of liquidated damages which are a
genuine pre-estimate of the damages which the other Party will suffer or incur
as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and the resultant non-
completion of the Arrangement and are not penalties. Each Party hereby
irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such
liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. Upon receipt of payment of the
Termination Payment by the applicable Party, such Party shall have no further
claim against the other Party in respect of the failure to complete the
Arrangement, provided that nothing herein shall preclude the other Party from
seeking injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach by the
first such Party of any of its obligations hereunder or otherwise to obtain
specific performance without the necessity of posting bond or security in
connection therewith.

        | (b)   |   

each Richmont Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be exchanged for an option (a "Replacement Option") granted by Alamos to
acquire that number of Alamos Common Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio
multiplied by the number of Richmont Shares subject to such Richmont Option,
provided that the aggregate number of Alamos Common Shares issuable to a
holder of Richmont Options pursuant to such Replacement Options shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole number of Alamos Common Shares. Such
Replacement Option shall have an exercise price per Alamos Common Share equal
to the exercise price per Richmont Share of such Richmont Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that the
exercise price of such Replacement Option shall be, and shall be deemed to be,
adjusted by the amount, and only to the extent, necessary to ensure that the
In the Money Amount of such Replacement Option does not exceed the In the
Money Amount of such Richmont Option before the exchange. The Replacement
Option shall have no vesting provisions and an expiry date of one year from
the date of issuance. Except, as provided in this Section 3.1(b), the
conditions to and manner of exercising and all other terms and conditions of
such Replacement Option will be the same as the Richmont Option for which it
is exchanged, and any document or agreement previously evidencing such
Richmont Option shall thereafter evidence and be deemed to evidence such
Replacement Option.

each Richmont DSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether
vested or unvested), notwithstanding the terms of the Richmont DSU Plan,
shall, without any further action by or on behalf of the holder thereof, be
deemed to be assigned and transferred by such holder to Richmont in exchange
for a cash payment from Richmont equal to the amount of the Consideration Cash
Value, and each such Richmont DSU shall immediately be cancelled.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment or settlement in respect of a
Richmont DSU that immediately prior to the exchange described in this Section
3.1(c) constituted deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code shall be made on the earliest practicable payment or
settlement date for such Richmont DSU that does not give rise to a violation
of, or the imposition of taxes or penalties under, Section 409A of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code;

holder to Richmont in exchange for a cash payment from Richmont equal to the
amount of the Consideration Cash Value and each such Richmont RSU shall
immediately be cancelled;

shall be exchanged for an award (a "Replacement RSU") granted by Alamos having
a value equal to the value of such Retained Employee RSU immediately prior to
the Effective Time, which shall be determined with reference to Alamos Common
Shares based on the Exchange Ratio, provided that the Exchange Ratio shall be
modified in a manner such that the aggregate fair market value of the Alamos
Common Shares to be acquired or received under the Replacement RSU immediately
after the issuance of the Replacement RSU will not exceed the aggregate fair
market value of the Richmont Shares that would have been acquired or received
under the Retained Employee RSU immediately before the issuance of the
Replacement RSU. Except as provided in this Section 3.1(e), the terms and
conditions of such Replacement RSU will be the same as the Retained Employee
RSU for which it is exchanged, and any document or agreement previously
evidencing such Retained Employee RSU shall thereafter evidence and be deemed
to evidence such Replacement RSU;

all Richmont Shares held by Dissenting Shareholders shall be deemed to have

exchange for a debt claim against Richmont in an amount determined in
accordance with Section 5.1 hereof, and: 

            |    |

of the number of Alamos Common Shares (which Alamos shall issue to the
Depositary on behalf of such Richmont Shareholders) equal to the excess of (a)
the aggregate number of Alamos Common Shares that otherwise would, if this
Section 4.1(a) did not apply, be issued to the Richmont Shareholders pursuant

            | (a)   |   

At or before the Effective Time, Alamos shall deposit or cause to be deposited
with the Depositary, for the benefit of and to be held on behalf of the
Richmont Shareholders, a treasury order or other evidence regarding the
issuance of, the aggregate number of Alamos Common Shares required in respect
of each Richmont Share pursuant to Section 4.2(d), and unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by Alamos and Richmont, Richmont shall deposit or cause to be
deposited with the Depositary, for the benefit of and to be held on behalf of
the holders of any of the Richmont RSUs and Richmont DSUs, the aggregate cash
amount required for the payments in respect of such securities as provided in
Section 3.1. 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | (b)   |   

Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of one or more outstanding
Richmont Shares represented by a duly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal, together with the certificate(s), if any, which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented such Richmont Share(s) and any such
additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require,
each Richmont Share so surrendered shall be exchanged by the Depositary, and
the Depositary shall deliver to the applicable Richmont Shareholder, as soon
as practicable and in accordance with Section 4.2(d), a treasury order or
other evidence of, Alamos Common Shares that such Richmont Shareholder is
entitled to receive under the Arrangement, less any amounts withheld pursuant
to Section 6.3. 

        |    |    

        | (c)   |   

As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Depositary shall deliver
to each holder of any Richmont RSUs and Richmont DSUs (as reflected on the

receive under the Arrangement, as applicable, less any amounts withheld
pursuant to Section 6.3.

        | (d)   |   

Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 6.1, each certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Richmont
Shares shall be deemed, immediately after the completion of the transactions
contemplated in Section 4.2(d), to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Consideration for such Richmont Shares. Any such
certificate formerly representing outstanding Richmont Shares not duly
surrendered on or before the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Date
shall cease to represent a claim by or interest of any former Richmont
Shareholder of any kind or nature against or in Alamos or Richmont.

or before the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Date, and any right or
claim to payment hereunder that remains outstanding on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or claim of

No Affected Securityholder shall be entitled to receive any consideration with
respect to Affected Securities other than the consideration to which such
Affected Securityholder is entitled to receive in accordance with Section 3.1
and no such Affected Securityholder shall be entitled to receive any interest,
dividends, premium or other payment in connection therewith, other than any
declared but unpaid dividends with a record date prior to the Effective Date.
No dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Affected Securities or with a record date on or after the

All dividends payable with respect to any Alamos Common Shares allotted and
issued pursuant to this Arrangement for which a certificate or other evidence
of such Alamos Common Shares has not been issued shall be paid or delivered to
the Depositary to be held by the Depositary in trust for the registered holder
thereof. All monies received by the Depositary shall be invested by it in
interest-bearing trust accounts upon such terms as the Depositary may
reasonably deem appropriate. The Depositary shall pay and deliver to any such
registered holder, as soon as reasonably practicable after application
therefor is made by the registered holder to the Depositary in such form as
the Depositary may reasonably require, such dividends and any interest thereon
to which such holder is entitled, net of applicable withholding and other
taxes.

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Richmont Shares that were transferred
pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will pay and
deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the
Consideration which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
4.2(d), net of amounts required to be withheld pursuant to Section 6.3. When
authorizing such payment and delivery in exchange for any lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, the Person to whom the payment is made shall, as a
condition precedent to the delivery thereof, give a bond satisfactory to
Richmont, Alamos and the Depositary in such sum as Alamos may direct or
otherwise indemnify Alamos in a manner satisfactory to Alamos against any
claim that may be made against Alamos with respect to the certificate alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Affected Securityholder in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

            | (b)   |   

Each of Richmont, Alamos and the Depositary that makes a payment to any
Richmont Shareholder under this Plan of Arrangement shall be authorized to
sell or otherwise dispose of such number of Alamos Common Shares otherwise
issuable to such Richmont Shareholder (if any) as is necessary to provide
sufficient funds to enable it to comply with its deducting or withholding
requirements and such party shall notify the applicable Richmont Shareholder
and remit any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale to such
Richmont Shareholder.
