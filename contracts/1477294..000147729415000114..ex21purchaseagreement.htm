NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1 
SALE AND PURCHASE OF SHARES

Section 1.1 Sale and Purchase of Shares; Assignment and Assumption of China

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at the Closing and following

French Seller exercises the European Sale Option, such amount shall be
increased to $1,000,000,000), plus (B) an amount equal to the Closing Cash,
minus (C) an amount equal to the Closing Debt, minus (D) the amount, if any,
by which the Target Working Capital exceeds the Closing Working Capital, plus
(E) the amount, if any, by which the Closing Working Capital exceeds the

and redistribute among the Sellers as promptly as reasonably practicable any
amounts paid to any Seller in excess of such Seller's Allocated Purchase
Price, such that, after giving effect to any such refunds,

(the "Resolution Period"), Buyer and Sellers shall seek in good faith to
resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Dispute Notice. If Sellers and Buyer reach agreement with
respect to any such Disputed Items, Buyer shall promptly revise the Closing
Statement to reflect such agreement.

(e) Independent Accountant. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve all of
the Disputed Items during the Resolution Period, then Buyer and Sellers shall
jointly engage, and submit the unresolved Disputed Items (the "Unresolved
Items") to, the Independent Accountant for resolution in accordance with the
terms of this Section 1.3(e). The Independent Accountant shall act as an
arbitrator to determine, based solely on presentations by Buyer and Sellers
and not by independent review, only the Unresolved Items still in dispute and
shall be limited to those adjustments, if any, required to be made for the
Closing Statement to comply with the provisions of this Agreement. Buyer and
Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent
Accountant to issue its written determination regarding the Unresolved Items
within thirty (30) days after such items are submitted for review. The
Independent Accountant shall make a determination with respect to the
Unresolved Items only and in a manner consistent with this Section 1.3 and in
accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles and the provisions of
this Agreement, and in no event shall the Independent Accountant's
determination of the Unresolved Items be for an amount that is outside the
range of Buyer's and Sellers' disagreement (which range shall in no event be
greater than the range represented by the amounts set forth in the Closing
Statement and Dispute Notice for such unresolved Disputed Items). Each party
shall use its reasonable best efforts to furnish to the Independent Accountant
such work papers and other documents and information pertaining to the
Unresolved Items as the Independent Accountant may reasonably request and
shall be afforded an opportunity to discuss the Unresolved Items with the
Independent Accountant at such hearing as the Independent Accountant shall
request or permit; provided that (i) each party shall provide the other party
with a copy of all 

materials provided to, and communications with, the Independent Accountant,
and (ii) no party (or any of its Affiliates, advisors or representatives)
shall engage in any ex parte communication with the Independent Accountant at
any time with respect to the Unresolved Items. The determination of the
Independent Accountant as to any Disputed Items shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon Buyer and the Sellers (absent manifest error) and the decision
of the Independent Accountant shall constitute an arbitral award that is
final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by
a court having jurisdiction thereover. The fees, expenses and costs of the
Independent Accountant shall be borne by Buyer and Sellers in the same
proportion as the aggregate amount of the Unresolved Items that is
unsuccessfully disputed by each (as determined by the Independent Accountant)
bears to the total amount of the Unresolved Items submitted to the Independent
Accountant. For example, if (x) the total amount of the Unresolved Items
submitted to the Independent Accountant for resolution in accordance with the
terms of this Section 1.3(e) is $1,000, (y) the aggregate amount of the
Unresolved Items resolved by the Independent Accountant in favor of Sellers is
$600 and (z) the total amount of fees, expenses and costs of the Independent
Accountant in connection with such dispute is $100, then Buyer shall bear $60
of such amount and Sellers shall bear $40 of such amount.

(f) Access to Information. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
provide promptly to the other party, reasonable access at reasonable times to
the books and records of such party and to appropriate employees and
representatives (including independent accountants) as such other party shall
reasonably request in connection with preparation and review of the Estimated
Closing Statement, the Closing Statement or any component thereof or
information contained or referred to therein, as the case may be, including
all work papers of the accountants who audited, compiled or reviewed such
statements or notices (subject to each party and its representatives entering
into any such access letters required by the other party's accountants in
connection herewith), and shall otherwise cooperate reasonably and in good
faith with such other party to arrive at a final determination of the amounts
set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement and the Closing Statement, as the
case may be.

(g) Final Adjustment. Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing
Statement is finalized pursuant to clause (c), (d) or (e) of this Section 1.3:

(i) (A) if the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Closing Working
Capital, Buyer shall pay to Sellers an amount equal to such excess, or (B) if
the Closing Working Capital is less than the Estimated Closing Working
Capital, Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such shortfall;

(ii) (A) if the Closing Cash exceeds the Estimated Closing Cash, Buyer shall
pay to Sellers an amount equal to such excess, or (B) if the Closing Cash is
less than the Estimated Closing Cash, Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to such shortfall; and

(iii) (A) if the Closing Debt exceeds the Estimated Closing Debt, Sellers
shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such excess, or (B) if the Closing Debt
is less than the Estimated Closing Debt, Buyer shall pay to Sellers an amount
equal to such shortfall; and 

(iv) (A) if the Company Group Transaction Expenses exceed the Estimated
Company Group Transaction Expenses, Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal
to such excess, or (B) if the Company Group Transaction Expenses are less than
the Estimated Company Group Transaction Expenses, Buyer shall pay to Sellers
an amount equal to such shortfall.

(h) Method of Payment, Etc. Any amount paid in respect of adjustments to the
Purchase Price made pursuant to this Section 1.3 shall be (i) paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
receiving party and (ii) treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
applicable Tax purposes to the extent permitted by Tax Law.

Section 1.4 Withholding. Buyer, its Affiliates, and any other Persons acting
on their behalf shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable under this Agreement any Taxes required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to any such payments under the Code, the Treasury Regulations
issued thereunder or any other applicable provision of Law. To the extent that
Buyer becomes aware of any applicable deduction or withholding in respect of
the Estimated Purchase Price with respect to the sale of the Shares and the
China Assets (other than on account of US Seller's failure to timely deliver
the certificate pursuant to Section 1.2(b)(i)(D)), Buyer shall promptly, and
in any event at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
provide written notice to the applicable Seller of its intention to make such
deduction or withholding. To the extent such amounts are withheld with respect
to any Person, such amounts shall be treated as having been paid to or on
behalf of such Person to the extent such amounts are properly remitted to the
applicable Governmental Authority. Upon request by Sellers, Buyer shall
furnish Sellers with official receipts (or copies thereof) evidencing the
payment of any withheld amounts (or, if such receipts are not available, other
evidence of payment reasonably acceptable to Sellers).

applicable Law. All Taxes required to be paid by each of the Companies and the

thereto) and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of
time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice
of the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns.

(e) Certain Events. None of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries will
be required to include any material item of income in, or exclude any material

Law), (ii) use of an improper method of accounting for a taxable period ending
on or before the Closing Date, (iii) written agreement with a Taxing Authority
executed prior to the Closing (including any "closing agreement" as described

non-U.S. Tax Law)), (iv) installment sale or open transaction disposition made
on or prior to the Closing Date, (v) any prepaid amounts received or deferred
revenue accrued on or prior to the Closing Date, or (vi) any election under

Affiliated Group filing a consolidated Income Tax Return (other than a group
the common parent of which was Schneider Electric Holdings, Inc. or was a
Company or Transferred Subsidiary) or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of
any Person (other than Schneider Electric Holdings, Inc. and its Subsidiaries,
the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries) under Section 1.1502-6 of the
Treasury Regulations (or any similar 

provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Tax Law), as a transferee or successor,
by contract, or otherwise.

(k) Sole Tax Representations. The representations and warranties set forth in
Section 2.8, Section 2.16 and this Section 2.17 are the sole representations
and warranties relating to Taxes and no other representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement shall be construed to cover any matter involving
Taxes. The representations of Sellers made in this Section 2.17 (other than
Section 2.17(e)) refer only to the past activities of the Companies and the

Section 4.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality; Books and Records.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Sellers shall (i) give Buyer,
its counsel, financial advisors, consultants, lenders, auditors and other
authorized representatives and agents (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Financing Sources) (the "Buyer Representatives") reasonable access to the
offices, properties, books and records (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
Tax Returns and other information and documents relating to Tax matters) of
the Companies, the Transferred Subsidiaries and the Business, (ii) furnish to
Buyer and the Buyer Representatives such financial and operating data and
other information relating to the Companies, the Transferred Subsidiaries or
the Business as such Persons may reasonably request (including furnishing, (1)
as soon as available but in no event later than forty-five (45) days following
the end of each calendar month, the unadjusted management accounts of the
Business for each such calendar month, and (2) as soon as available but in no
event later than sixty (60) days following the end of each calendar quarter,
the unadjusted management accounts of the Business for such calendar quarter,
in each case prepared in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice), and (iii) instruct the employees, accountants, counsel, consultants
and financial advisors of Sellers and their Affiliates to cooperate with Buyer
in connection with Buyer's preparation to integrate the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries into Buyer's organization following the Closing.

(b) From and after the Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall, upon reasonable
notice by any Seller or its Affiliates to Buyer or by Buyer to any Seller, as
the case may be, (i) provide one another and their respective representatives
reasonable access to their properties, information, data, books, records,
employees and auditors to the extent relating to the Business or the Companies
or the Transferred Subsidiaries with respect to any pre-Closing period or
matter occurring prior to the Closing, (ii) permit one another and their
respective representatives to make such copies and inspections of any such
information, data, books and records as any of them may reasonably 

request, (iii) make available to one another and their respective
representatives, their officers, employees, accountants and representatives to
provide reasonable assistance and co-operation in the review of information
described in this Section 4.2(b) and (iv) cooperate with one another and their
respective representatives, including by furnishing such records, information
and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials or appeals and make available their respective employees as witnesses,
to the extent reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with any
Litigation arising out of the Business or operations of the Companies or the
Transferred Subsidiaries in which the requesting party or any of its
Affiliates are or may from time to time be involved, in each case other than
with respect to any actual or potential Litigation involving disputes between
Buyer, on the one hand, and any Seller, on the other hand.

(c) Prior to, and for a period of six (6) months following, Closing, upon the
written request of Buyer and at Buyer's sole cost and expense, Sellers shall,
and shall cause each member of the Seller Group and each of their respective
employees to, use reasonable best efforts to promptly provide Buyer and the
Buyer Representatives with such financial and other information relating to
the Business as is reasonably available to the Sellers that may be required in
connection with, or is otherwise reasonably advisable or useful in connection
with, the preparation of any financial statements of the Business (including
any audited financial statements) (it being understood, for the avoidance of
doubt, that such information may, to the extent necessary, include information
pertaining to the Seller Group as related to the Business) as may be necessary
or advisable to prepare or audit financial statements in accordance with GAAP,
IFRS or such other applicable accounting standards designated by Buyer, to the
extent and in such form and for such periods as would be required for a filing
pursuant to the Exchange Act (including Regulation S-X thereunder and other
accounting rules and regulations of the SEC), including in order to enable the
Buyer to satisfy any reporting obligation it may have to file such financial
statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission following the Closing
Date under Item 9.01 of Form 8-K under the Exchange Act (including any
auditors' consents to permit the incorporation by reference of any such
audited financial statements of the Business in any pending registration
statement of the Buyer), but for the avoidance of doubt regardless of whether
any such filing is in fact required, and to otherwise reasonably cooperate
with Buyer and Buyer Representatives in connection with the preparation of any
such audited financial statements of the Business; provided however, that the
Sellers shall not be required to provide any financial or other information
pursuant to this Section 4.2(c) that is not then reasonably available to the
Sellers.

(d) Anything to the contrary in Section 4.2(a) or Section 4.2(b)
notwithstanding, (i) access rights pursuant to Section 4.2(a), Section 4.2(b)
or Section 4.2(c) shall be exercised in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the Business or any other business of the
party granting such access, (ii) the party granting access may withhold any
document (or portions thereof) or information (A) that is subject to the terms
of a non-disclosure agreement with a third party (provided that such party
shall reasonably cooperate to obtain consent to disclose, so that Buyer and
its representatives may obtain access to such information), (B) that
constitutes privileged attorney-client communications or attorney work product
and the transfer of which, or the provision of access to which, as reasonably
determined by such party's counsel, constitutes a waiver of any such privilege
(provided that such party shall cooperate to enable Buyer to enter 

into appropriate confidentiality, joint defense or similar documents or
arrangements so that Buyer and its representatives may obtain access to such
information), (C) if the provision of access to such document (or portion
thereof) or information, as determined by such party in good faith, would
reasonably be expected to conflict with applicable Laws or agreements with
Governmental Authorities or (D) that such party determines in good faith
constitutes competitively sensitive cost or pricing information including
bidding history (provided, that, if requested by Buyer, such documents or
information under this section (ii)(D) will be provided to members of the
clean team pursuant to a "clean team agreement" to be negotiated in good faith
and entered into by the parties following the date hereof (the "Clean Team
Agreement"), (iii) neither any Seller nor any of its Affiliates or
representatives shall have any obligation to provide Buyer or its
representatives (A) access to any portion of any Consolidated or Combined
Return not related to the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries or (B)
access to the properties or assets of any of the Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries to conduct any subsurface or Phase II environmental
investigation, or other intrusive sampling or testing of any environmental
medium without Sellers' consent (it being agreed that, in the event that the
restrictions of clauses (ii)(A) - (C) or (iii) apply, Sellers shall provide
Buyer with a reasonably detailed description of the information not provided
and Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to design and implement,
to the extent practicable, alternative disclosure arrangements to enable Buyer
to evaluate any such information without violating Law or the applicable
privilege or breaching Sellers' obligations to any Third Party), and (iv) the
party requesting access pursuant to Section 4.2(a) or Section 4.2(b) shall
reimburse the other party promptly for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by the other party in connection with any
such request made after the Closing.

(e) All information provided to Buyer or its respective Affiliates pursuant to
this Section 4.1 prior to the Closing shall be held by Buyer as Confidential
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of June 13,
2015 between Custom Sensors and Technologies, Inc. and Sensata Technologies,
Inc. and, to the extent applicable, the Clean Team Agreement (such
Confidentiality Agreement and, to the extent applicable, the Clean Team
Agreement being collectively referred to as (the "Confidentiality Agreement"))
and shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference. The Confidentiality Agreement is hereby
amended to provide that it shall continue in full force and effect until the
Closing Date, at which time it shall automatically terminate.

(f) From and after the Closing Date: (i) for a period of two (2) years after
the Closing Date, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates and
representatives to, maintain in confidence any written, oral or other
information relating to the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries
obtained by virtue of Sellers' ownership of the Business or the Companies and
the Transferred Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, and (ii) for a period of
two (2) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and representatives to, maintain in confidence any written, oral or
other information of or relating to any Seller or its Affiliates (other than
to the extent related to the Business, the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries) obtained by virtue of Buyer's or Sellers' ownership, management
or provision of services to the Business, the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries from and after the Closing, except, in each case, to the extent
that the applicable party is required to disclose such information by judicial
or administrative process or pursuant to applicable Law (in which case such
party shall notify the other party and cooperate 

reasonably in obtaining any appropriate protective order or other limitation
to maintain the confidentiality of such information) or such information can
be shown to have been in the public domain through no fault of the applicable
party.

(g) Subject to Sections 4.2(f) and (g), Sellers and their Affiliates shall
have the right to retain copies of all books, data, files, information and
records in any media (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Tax Returns and
other information and documents relating to tax matters) of the Business,
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries relating to periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date or the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period
(i) relating to information (including employment and medical records)
regarding the Transferred Employees, (ii) as may be required by any
Governmental Authority, including pursuant to any applicable Law or regulatory
request, or (iii) as may be necessary for any Seller or its Affiliates to
perform their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements, in each case subject to compliance with all applicable
privacy Laws. Buyer agrees that, with respect to all original books, data,
files, information and records of the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries existing as of the Closing Date, it will (x) comply in all
material respects with all applicable Laws relating to the preservation and
retention of records, (y) apply preservation and retention policies that are
no less stringent in the aggregate than those generally applied by Buyer to
its own books and records and (z) for at least seven years after the Closing
Date, preserve and retain all such original books, data, files, information
and records.

(h) Promptly following receipt of the written request therefor, after the
Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause the other members of the Seller Group
to, deliver to Buyer any books and records of the Business or the Companies or
Transferred Subsidiaries in Sellers' or such other Seller Group member's or
their respective representatives' possession or under their control to the
extent not already in the possession of the Companies or the Transferred
Subsidiaries.

Section 4.3 Governmental Approvals; Third-Party Consents.

(a) Sellers and Buyer shall (i) cooperate to make, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, all filings and applications with and to, and obtain all
licenses, permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and
Orders of, applicable Governmental Authorities to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain
consents from other Persons reasonable or necessary under Contract, or the
applicable Law governing such Contract, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including any
such consents listed or referenced in Section 2.3 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter; provided, that in obtaining any such consent, unless required by the
applicable agreement neither Sellers nor Buyer shall be obligated to (i) pay
or commit to pay to such Person whose consent is being solicited any cash or
other consideration (other than filing/application fees and similar charges
imposed by any Governmental Authority), and (ii) make any commitment or incur
any liability or other obligation due to such Person (and Sellers shall not
make any such commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to
such Person that is binding upon the Companies, the Transferred Subsidiaries
or the Business, without Buyer's written consent). In furtherance of the
foregoing, Buyer agrees to provide such information in its possession or
within its control as to financial capability, resources and creditworthiness
as may 

be reasonably requested by any Government Authority whose consent or approval
is sought hereunder.

(b) In furtherance of the provisions set forth in Section 4.3(a), (i) Sellers
and Buyer shall file or cause to be filed (x) as promptly as practicable, but
in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the date hereof, with the
United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the United States
Department of Justice (the "DOJ") all notification and report forms that may
be required pursuant to the HSR Act, and (y) within fifteen (15) Business Days
after the date hereof, a pre-notification filing under any other applicable
Law referred to in Section 2.2(b)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter or
Section 3.2(b)(ii) of the Buyer Disclosure Letter, as applicable, for the
transactions contemplated hereby, and thereafter provide as promptly as
practicable any supplemental information requested in connection therewith,
and (ii) include in each such filing, notification and report form referred to
in the immediately preceding clause (i) a request for early termination or
acceleration of any applicable waiting or review periods, to the extent
available under the applicable Competition Law or other applicable Law. In
connection therewith, Sellers and Buyer shall (A) furnish to the other party
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission that is necessary under the HSR Act and other Competition Laws, (B)
subject to applicable Laws, provide the other party with a draft of any filing
or submission and a reasonable opportunity to review such draft before making
or causing to be made such filing or submission, and consider in good faith
the views of such other party regarding such filing or submission (excluding
information not customarily shared by parties in transactions of this nature),
(C) not extend any applicable waiting or review periods, withdraw any such
filing or application or enter into any agreement with a Governmental
Authority to delay or not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
to be consummated on the Closing Date, except with the prior written consent
of the other party, (D) not have any substantive contact with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filing or proceeding contemplated by this Section
4.3(b) unless they have engaged in prior consultation with the other party
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, given the other
party the reasonable opportunity to participate and (E) keep each other
reasonably apprised of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and
any other applicable Governmental Authority.

(c) Buyer further agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Law or other Law so as
to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any
event prior to the End Date), including the prompt use of its reasonable best
efforts to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any permanent,
preliminary or temporary injunction or other Order that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this
Agreement shall obligate Buyer to (i) litigate or otherwise contest any
Litigation or Order or the entry of any Order seeking to delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such transactions under
any Competition Law or (ii) agree to any divestitures of any product lines,
categories of assets or businesses or operations. 

Section 4.4 Employees and Employee Benefits.

(a) U.S. Transferred Employees.

(i) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date or if
earlier, the date of termination of employment of the relevant employee (the
"Continuation Period"), Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide
employees of the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries as of the Closing
who are located in the United States (including those employees who are full-
time, part-time, temporary, on vacation or on a medical or disability or any
other paid or unpaid approved leave of absence (but excluding the Excluded
Employees) (the "U.S. Transferred Employees") with (A) cash compensation
(including base salary or wage rates and target bonus or other target
incentive opportunities, but excluding equity-based compensation) that is
substantially comparable in the aggregate to that provided to such U.S.
Transferred Employees as of the date of this Agreement, and (B) employee
benefits (excluding equity-based compensation or benefits, defined benefit
pension, nonqualified deferred compensation and post-termination or retiree
welfare benefits) that are comparable in the aggregate to the employee
benefits (excluding equity-based compensation or benefits, defined benefit
pension, nonqualified deferred compensation and post-termination or retiree
welfare benefits) provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any U.S. Transferred Employee who is not
actively at work and is receiving or eligible to receive short-term or long-
term disability benefits as of the Closing Date (an "Absent Employee") shall
become and remain an employee of Sellers and their Affiliates (other than any
of the Companies and any of the Transferred Subsidiaries) until and unless
such employee presents himself or herself for active employment within six (6)
months following the Closing Date or such longer period as may be provided
under applicable Law. At such time, the Absent Employee will become an
employee of Buyer or its Affiliates and will be treated as a U.S. Transferred
Employee for all purposes hereunder as required by applicable Law. Nothing in
this Section 4.4 shall be construed to prohibit Buyer and its Affiliates from
terminating the employment of any U.S. Transferred Employee or any other
Person at any time and for any or no reason.

(ii) Under the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements established
or maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which U.S. Transferred
Employees are eligible to participate during the plan year in which the
Closing occurs (the "New U.S. Benefit Plans"), each U.S. Transferred Employee
shall be credited with the same amount of service as was credited as of the
Closing under the Benefit Plans in which such U.S. Transferred Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing providing the same type of
benefit for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation or other
paid time off rate accrual and eligibility to receive benefits (but not
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan, and not for any
purpose under any equity-based plan or arrangement); provided that such
crediting of service shall not operate to duplicate any benefit or
compensation and shall be credited only to the extent such service was
credited for the same purpose under an analogous Company Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Closing. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to the extent permitted under the terms of the
New U.S. Benefit Plans and with respect to the applicable plan year in which 

the Closing Date occurs, Buyer shall or shall cause its Affiliates to use
commercially reasonable efforts to allow each U.S. Transferred Employee to
immediately be eligible to participate in such New U.S. Benefit Plans without
any waiting time, to the extent coverage under such New U.S. Benefit Plans
replaces coverage under a Benefit Plan providing the same type of benefit in
which such U.S. Transferred Employee was eligible to participate immediately
prior to the Closing (such plans, collectively, the "Old U.S. Benefit Plans"),
and to the extent such waiting time did not apply with respect to such U.S.
Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of Section 4.4(a)(i), this Section 4.4(a)(ii)
or any other provisions herein, for purposes of each New U.S. Benefit Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, and/or vision benefits to any U.S.
Transferred Employee and his or her dependents, provided that the Buyer is
provided with the administrative information that is necessary to comply with
the following provisions (i) and (ii): (i) Buyer and its Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
under such New U.S. Benefit Plan to be waived for such U.S. Transferred
Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such pre-
existing condition exclusions were waived or were inapplicable under the
comparable Old U.S. Benefit Plan, and (ii) Buyer and its Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such U.S. Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents during the
portion of the plan year prior to the Closing Date under the Old U.S. Benefit
Plan to be taken into account under such New U.S. Benefit Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such U.S. Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year that includes the Closing Date, to the extent such credit
would have been given under any comparable Old U.S. Benefit Plan.

(iii) Provided that Sellers have supplied Buyer with a true and complete list
of employee layoffs, by date and location, implemented in the 90-day period
preceding the Closing by the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries
located in the United States, Buyer and its Affiliates shall be solely
responsible for and indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates
for any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as such terms are defined in the WARN
Act, affecting in whole or in part any site of employment, facility, operating
unit or U.S. Transferred Employee that occurs on or after the Closing Date as
a result of Buyer's or its Affiliates' actions, and for any Losses arising out
of or resulting from Buyer's or its Affiliates' actions or failures to provide
any required notice under WARN Act.

(b) Non-U.S. Transferred Employees. With respect to any employees of the
Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries as of the Closing who are located
outside of the United States (including those employees who are full-time,
part-time, temporary, on vacation or on a medical or disability or any other
paid or unpaid approved leave of absence but excluding the Excluded Employees)
(the "Non-U.S. Transferred Employees" and, collectively with the U.S.
Transferred Employees, the "Transferred Employees"), in the event that the
applicable Laws of any country or any applicable collective agreement require
Buyer or its Affiliates (i) to maintain Terms and Conditions of Employment
with respect to any Non-U.S. Transferred Employee following the Closing or
(ii) to continue or cause to be continued any employment contract of any
Non-U.S. Transferred Employee, Buyer shall cause the entity that employs such
Non-U.S. 

Transferred Employee following the Closing to comply with such requirements to
the extent required by applicable Law; provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 4.4(b) shall prevent Buyer from terminating the employment of any
Non-U.S. Transferred Employee after the Closing (for which Buyer shall be
responsible for any costs or liabilities) or otherwise modifying the Terms and
Conditions of Employment of any Non-U.S. Transferred Employees to the extent
permitted by Law or otherwise agreed with the applicable employee(s) or
representative(s) thereof. "Terms and Conditions of Employment" shall mean the
rights of Non-U.S. Transferred Employees according to their individual terms
and conditions of employment with Seller or its Affiliates as of the date of
this Agreement (or as of the Closing if required by applicable Law) and, where
applicable, under company or shop agreements, and any arrangements based on
works customs and unilateral undertakings, if and to the extent they provide
to a Non-U.S. Transferred Employee direct and enforceable causes of action
against the employer.

(c) Other Provisions Regarding Transferred Employees.

(i) Prior to the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate and take
such steps as may be necessary to cause, effective as of the Closing Date, the
employment of the employees of Sellers and their Affiliates whose names,
titles, job functions and jurisdictions of employment are set forth in Section
4.4(c)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the "Transferred Seller Employees")
to be transferred to the Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer designated by Buyer
(including by offering employment to such Transferred Seller Employees (which
offers shall be for a comparable position and in the same geographic location
as applied immediately prior to Closing and shall otherwise comply with the
requirements set forth in Section 4.4(a)(i) or Section 4.4(b), as applicable),
or through such legal or other transfer process as may apply in the applicable
jurisdiction), and from and after such transfer such employees shall be
treated as Transferred Employees for all purposes under this Agreement. In
connection with such transfers of employment of the Transferred Seller
Employees, except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 4.4(c)(ii), the
Buyer agrees that the Buyer or its applicable Affiliates shall assume all
liabilities and obligations of any kind in connection with, involving or
relating to the employment of or employee benefits provided to or accrued by
the Transferred Seller Employees, including with respect to periods prior to
the Closing Date (but without limiting any of the indemnification or other
rights of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements),
except to the extent such liabilities are provided under a funded or fully
insured Seller Benefit Plan (such liabilities, the "Transferred Employment
Liabilities"). After the Closing, Buyer and its applicable Affiliates will be
responsible for and indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates
for and against all Transferred Employment Liabilities; provided, however,
that it is understood and agreed that (A) Sellers or another member of the
Seller Group shall be responsible for any legally required severance,
termination pay and other similar costs and expenses associated with the
termination of employment of such Transferred Seller Employees by Seller or
another member of the Seller Group for purposes of the transfer of employment
(if applicable in the jurisdiction) ("Severance Costs") and (B) in the event
the employment of a Transferred Seller Employee does not automatically
transfer to Buyer or one of its Affiliates under applicable Law and such
Transferred Seller Employee does not accept employment with Buyer, Sellers or
another member of the Seller Group will be 

responsible for all severance, termination pay and other similar costs and
expenses associated with the termination of employment of such Transferred
Seller Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer's assumption of the
Transferred Employment Liabilities will include accrued payroll and, subject
to Section 4.4(c)(viii), accrued vacation and paid time off amounts for the
Transferred Seller Employees and shall require the Buyer and its Affiliates to
provide comparable terms and conditions of employment and to credit each
Transferred Seller Employee with the same amount of service as was credited as
of the Closing under applicable Benefit Plans in which such Transferred Seller
Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, in each case to the
extent that Buyer's failure to do so would result in Seller or another member
of the Seller Group incurring any Severance Costs. Subject to any applicable
Law, Sellers shall cause copies of all personnel records of the Transferred
Seller Employees to be provided to Buyer or designated Affiliate of Buyer, as
applicable. Buyer shall provide to Sellers drafts of all documents to be
entered into in connection with the transfer of the Transferred Seller
Employees reasonably in advance and will give due consideration to any
reasonable comments of Sellers on such documents. If any Transferred Seller
Employee requires a work permit or employment pass or other legal or
regulatory approval or filing for his or her employment with the Buyer or a
designated Affiliate of Buyer, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates
to, authorize the transfer of any such permit, pass or other approval or
filing to the Buyer or a designated Affiliate of Buyer, as applicable
(provided that Sellers make no representation as to the enforceability of any
such transfer) or take all necessary steps as apply in the jurisdiction to
cooperate with the Buyer or a designated affiliate of Buyer, as applicable, to
apply to the competent Governmental Authority for issuance or update of any
such permit, pass or other approval or filing, and will reasonably cooperate
with Buyer to seek to provide that all such work permits, passes or other
necessary approvals are valid and effective as of the Closing Date to the
extent required by applicable Law. In the event that any Transferred Seller
Employee is unable to secure a proper permit, pass or other approval
permitting such employee to work for Buyer as of the Closing, such employee
shall be deemed to have been unable to transfer employment under subsection
(B) above of this Section 4.4(c), until such time as any applicable permit,
pass or other approval is secured (and the Transferred Seller Employee will
transfer employment to Buyer or its Affiliate at such time).

(ii) As of the Closing, except as otherwise agreed between the Buyer and the
Seller pursuant to their reasonable cooperation as provided in Section
4.4(c)(i) above, each of the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall
terminate its participation in each Benefit Plan in which the Non-U.S.
Transferred Employees and the Transferred Seller Employees who are located
outside of the United States (the "Non-U.S. Transferred Seller Employees")
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date that is not sponsored and
maintained by such Company or Transferred Subsidiary, and the participation of
the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees and the Non-U.S. Transferred Seller
Employees in each Benefit Plan that is not sponsored and maintained by any of
the Companies or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries shall be terminated
except as specified in the terms of any such Benefit Plan or as required by
applicable Law, and each Non-U.S. Transferred Employee and Non-U.S.
Transferred Seller Employee shall cease active participation in and benefit
accruals under such Benefit Plans and Schneider Plans. Prior to the Closing,
the Companies and the 

Transferred Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary to transfer,
effective prior to the Closing Date, the sponsorship of, and all assets and
liabilities under and with respect to, each Excluded Plan (including any
Company Benefit Plan) that is sponsored and maintained by any of the Companies
or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries as of the date hereof to one of the
Sellers or its Affiliates (other than any of the Companies or any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries), and Sellers and its Affiliates shall accept such
transfer of the sponsorship of, and all assets and Liabilities under, each
Excluded Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, "Excluded Plan" means each
"employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that is
maintained, sponsored, contributed to or required to be contributed to by the
Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries), in each case covering the U.S. Transferred Employees and the
Transferred Seller Employees who are located and reside in the United States
(the "U.S. Transferred Seller Employees"), but excluding the plans and
arrangements set forth in Section 4.4(c)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.
As of the Closing, each of the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries
shall terminate its participation in each Excluded Plan, and the participation
of the U.S. Transferred Employees and the U.S. Transferred Seller Employees in
each such Excluded Plan (and in each Benefit Plan maintained by Schneider
Electric SE and its Affiliates in which such employees participate prior to
the Closing ("Schneider Plans")) shall be terminated except as specified in
the terms of any such Benefit Plan or as required by applicable Law, and each
U.S. Transferred Employee and U.S. Transferred Seller Employee shall cease
active participation in and benefit accruals under such Benefit Plans and
Schneider Plans. Sellers and their Affiliates (other than any of the Companies
and any of the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall assume and retain the
sponsorship of and be solely responsible for all Liabilities relating to or at
any time arising under or in connection with any Excluded Plan, including with
respect to any Transferred Seller Employees in the United States. The Sellers
will use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer all documents, data,
records and information relating to the Excluded Plans that prior to the
Closing were maintained or sponsored by the Companies or the Transferred
Subsidiaries to the Seller or one of its Affiliates prior to the Closing. From
and after the Closing, the Seller and its Affiliates and the Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) will
reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to the sharing of
information regarding and the administration of such Excluded Plans, which
shall include making their employees who have (or have access) to any
information or knowledge regarding past actions related to or past
administration of such Excluded Plans available to the other party at
reasonable times and on reasonable notice, without cost or fee. Sellers shall
be solely responsible for any obligations under Code Section 4980B with
respect to any "MandA qualified beneficiaries" as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 54.4980B-9.

(iii) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall take such steps as may be necessary
to cause, effective as of no later than the Closing Date, the employment of
the employees of the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries whose names,
titles, job functions and jurisdictions of employment are set forth in Section
4.4(c)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (the "Excluded Employees") to be
transferred to the Sellers or an Affiliate of Sellers and such Excluded
Employees shall not be treated as Transferred Employees for any purpose under
this Agreement. In connection with such transfers of employment of the
Excluded 

Employees, except as expressly provided in Section 4.4(c)(iv), the Sellers
agree that the Sellers or their applicable Affiliates shall assume all
liabilities and obligations of any kind in connection with, involving or
relating to the employment of or employee benefits provided to or accrued by
the Excluded Employees, including with respect to periods prior to the Closing
Date, except to the extent such liabilities are provided under a funded or
fully insured Company Benefit Plan (such liabilities, the "Excluded Employment
Liabilities"). From and after the Closing the Sellers and their applicable
Affiliates will be responsible for and indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries)
for and against all Excluded Employment Liabilities. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the event the employment of an Excluded Employee does not
automatically transfer to the Sellers or one of their Affiliates (other than
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) under applicable Law and such
Excluded Employee does not accept employment with the Sellers or their
applicable Affiliate (other than the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries), the Sellers will be responsible and will reimburse the
applicable Company or Transferred Subsidiary for all notice, severance,
termination pay and other similar costs and expenses associated with the
termination of employment of such Excluded Employee. All personnel records of
the Excluded Employees will be transferred to the Sellers or their applicable
Affiliate (other than the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries).

(iv) As of the Closing, except as otherwise agreed between the Buyer and the
Seller pursuant to their reasonable cooperation, each Excluded Employee who is
located outside of the United States (a "Non-U.S. Excluded Employee") shall
cease active participation in and benefit accruals under all Benefit Plans
that are sponsored and maintained by any Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary, and each of Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Companies
and the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall terminate its participation in each
Benefit Plan in which the Non-U.S. Transferred Employees, the U.S. Transferred
Seller Employees and/or the Non-U.S. Excluded Employees participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date that is sponsored and maintained by any
Company or Transferred Subsidiary.

(v) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliates
may establish or designate one or more defined contribution plans and trusts
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code in which U.S. Transferred
Employees who were eligible to participate in the Company Benefit Plan or
Seller Benefit Plan that is a defined contribution plan immediately prior to
the Closing Date (the "Seller DC Plan") will become eligible to participate
after the Closing Date (the "Buyer DC Plan"). As of the Closing Date, all U.S.
Transferred Employees who participated in the Seller DC Plan immediately prior
to the Closing Date shall cease to contribute to and shall become fully vested
in their account balances under the Seller DC Plan. As of the Closing, the
Seller or the applicable Company or Transferred Subsidiary shall make to the
Seller DC Plan all employer contributions that would have been made on behalf
of the U.S. Transferred Employees had the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement not occurred, regardless of any service or end-of-year employment
requirements, but prorated for the portion of the plan year that ends on the
Closing Date, it being understood that any accrual in respect of such employer
contributions 

that are actually so made shall not be included as a current liability in
Closing Working Capital. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date,
the U.S. Transferred Employees who participated in the Seller DC Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be entitled to a distribution of
their account balances in accordance with the terms of the Seller DC Plan and
applicable Law, and Buyer shall take any and all action necessary to ensure
that the Buyer DC Plan accepts a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of such distributions from the Seller DC Plan
that are eligible rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c) of the
Code), (including the promissory notes of any outstanding participant loans,
if such rollovers are elected by any U.S. Transferred Employee, provided the
rollover occurs within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date).

(vi) As of the Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliates may establish or
designate medical and dependent care flexible spending account plans (the
"Buyer FSA Plans") that will provide benefits to U.S. Transferred Employees
who participated in the Company Benefit Plans or Seller Benefit Plans that are
medical and dependent care flexible spending account plans immediately prior
to the Closing Date (the "Seller FSA Plans"). On the Closing Date, the U.S.
Transferred Employees will cease participation in the Seller FSA Plans. As
soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Sellers shall determine on an
aggregate basis whether the benefits paid by the Seller FSA Plans to U.S.
Transferred Employees for claims incurred prior to the Closing Date exceeded
or were less than the amount of payroll deductions Sellers or its Affiliates
(including the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries) collected from the
U.S. Transferred Employees prior to the Closing Date. If the claims paid by
the Seller FSA Plans exceeded the payroll deductions, then Buyer or its
Affiliates shall promptly reimburse Sellers for any excess of such claims
paid. If the claims paid by the Seller FSA Plans are less than the payroll
deductions collected by Sellers or its Affiliates (including the Companies or
the Transferred Subsidiaries), then Sellers shall promptly pay over to Buyer
or its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries)
the excess of the payroll deductions collected over the claims paid. This
Section 4.4(c)(vi) shall be interpreted and administered in a manner
consistent with Rev. Rul. 2002-32.

(vii) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to, be bound by, and to comply with the terms of all collective
bargaining, works council, trade union, or other collective agreements that
cover one or more Transferred Employees (each, a "Collective Agreement") as in
effect on the Closing Date until Buyer or its Affiliates negotiate a new
collective agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from
and after the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, be bound
by, and comply with, the terms of all Collective Agreements applicable to
Transferred Employees employed in France on the Closing Date in accordance
with the provisions of applicable Law, or until Buyer or its Affiliates
negotiate a new Collective Agreement with respect to such employees.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.4, Buyer agrees
that the provisions of this Section 4.4 shall be subject to any applicable
provisions of a Collective Agreement in respect of Transferred Employees, to
the extent the provisions of this Section 4.4 are inconsistent with or
otherwise in conflict with the provisions of any such Collective Agreement. 

(viii) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.4(a)(i), effective as of
the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be credited with respect to each
Transferred Employee and Transferred Seller Employee the same number of earned
but unused vacation and paid time off days credited by Sellers and their
Subsidiaries with respect to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date (except to the extent any accrued vacation amounts are paid
out to employees in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), solely to the extent reflected as a liability in the Closing
Working Capital. Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall permit the
Transferred Employees to use such vacation and paid time off days in
accordance with the vacation and paid time off policies of Buyer or its
Affiliates as in effect from time to time. Following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall permit the Transferred Employees to use such vacation and paid time off
days at times reasonably consistent with the business needs of the Business
and in accordance with the vacation and paid time off policies of Buyer as in
effect from time to time.

(ix) Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate in communications with Transferred
Employees and Transferred Seller Employees with respect to employee benefit
plans and with respect to other matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such cooperation shall include
the provision of information from the Seller or the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries to the Buyer concerning the Transferred Employees and
Transferred Seller Employees as is necessary or appropriate to facilitate the
transactions contemplated by this agreement, including information regarding
pay, employee benefits and terms and conditions of employment. Without
limiting the foregoing, until the Closing Date, (i) Buyer shall consult with
Sellers and obtain Sellers' consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) before distributing any communications to
any Transferred Employees or Transferred Seller Employees, whether relating to
employee benefits, terms of employment or otherwise and shall provide Sellers
with advance copies of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment on (and shall
consider in good faith all such comments), all material communications to any
employee relating to post-Closing employment, employee benefits, terms of
employment or otherwise, and (ii) except with respect to the Excluded
Employees in connection with the Pre-Closing Restructuring as provided in
Exhibit A, the Sellers shall comply with Section 4.1 prior to transferring the
employment of any employee who is currently employed by a Company or a
Transferred Subsidiary to an Affiliate of the Seller that is not a Company or
a Transferred Subsidiary. In addition, prior to and after the Closing Date,
the parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate to satisfy any requirement or
custom to, consult with or provide information to, with respect to any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any competent labor organization
and/or employee representative body.

(x) No provision of this Section 4.4, whether express or implied, shall (i)
constitute or create an employment or other service agreement with any
Transferred Employee, any Transferred Seller Employees or any other Person,
(ii) be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Benefit Plan,
Company Benefit Plan, Seller Benefit Plan or other benefit or compensation
plan, policy, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) limit the right of
Buyer, Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Plan, Seller 

Benefit Plan or other benefit or compensation plan, policy, program, agreement
or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by
any of them, or (iv) create any obligation to continue the employment of, or
any particular term, condition or arrangement of employment following the
Closing of any Transferred Employee, Transferred Seller Employee, Excluded
Employee or any other Person at any time. Seller and Buyer acknowledge and
agree that all of the provisions contained in this Section 4.4 are included
for the sole benefit of the parties and that nothing in this Section 4.4,
whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other
rights in any Person, including, without limitation, any Transferred Employee,
Transferred Seller Employee, Excluded Employee, former employee, any
participant in any existing Benefit Plan or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof.

(xi) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Seller will (or will
cause its applicable Affiliates to) seek and use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain waivers and will solicit shareholder approval (by written
consent in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) of any payments that
may, separately or in the aggregate, constitute "excess parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) that may be made to
individuals who are "disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section
280G(c) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such that such payments would not
be deemed to constitute "excess parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G
of the Code. Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to Buyer
notification and evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer that (a) a vote was
solicited in conformance with Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite stockholder approval was
obtained with respect to any waived payments or benefits that were subject to
the stockholder vote, or (b) that such stockholder approval was not obtained
and, as a consequence, that such waived payments or benefits shall not be made
or provided to the extent they would cause any amounts to constitute "excess
parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code; provided that Seller
shall not be in breach of this covenant solely as a result of the refusal of
any disqualified individual to waive the applicable payments and submit them
to the applicable stockholder vote, so long as Seller used commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit such waiver (provided that Seller shall not be
required to provide any additional value to such disqualified individual in
order to receive such waiver). The waivers and any communications and
documents regarding the 280G approval process (including the computations of
parachute payments, the identification of the "disqualified individuals" who
are potential recipients of parachute payments, and the waivers of payments
and/or benefits executed by the affected individuals) shall be made available
to Buyer within a reasonable time prior to the Closing, and Buyer shall have
the right to review and approve (which approval shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed) such waivers, communications and documents
before they are executed by any applicable "disqualified individual" or the
stockholders of the Company or its Subsidiaries (as applicable) and/or
distributed to such stockholders.

Section 4.5 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a press release issued by Buyer to be
reasonably agreed upon by the 

Sellers. Other than the initial press release, and except as required by or
advisable under applicable Law or stock exchange rules, neither Buyer nor any
member of the Seller Group shall make, or permit any of their Subsidiaries or
representatives to make, any additional public announcement in respect of or
otherwise publish this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the other party. In
the event that any such additional public announcement is required by or
advisable under applicable Law or stock exchange rules, the party obligated to
make such announcement shall promptly provide the other party with reasonable
advance written notice of such requirement and the content of the proposed
announcement and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
release or announcement and consider in good faith any comments with respect
thereto. Promptly after the Closing Date, the parties shall cooperate and
agree on both the strategy and content of a joint strategy and script for
communications regarding the transaction contemplated hereby with employees,
customers and suppliers of the Business.

Section 4.6 Insurance. Except as provided in the second sentence of this
Section 4.6, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing
Date, the Companies, the Transferred Subsidiaries, the Business and the Assets
of the Business shall cease to be insured by, have access or availability to,
be entitled to make claims on, be entitled to claim benefits from or seek
coverage under any insurance policies or any self-insured programs of Sellers
or any member of the Seller Group, other than the third-party insurance
policies listed in Section 4.6 of the Seller Disclosure Letter. With respect
to events or circumstances relating to the Business, the Companies, the
Transferred Subsidiaries or their assets and current or former employees that
occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date and that remain covered by
third-party liability insurance policies of any Seller or its Subsidiaries not
listed on Section 4.6 of the Seller Disclosure Letter (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include any self-insurance programs or captive
policies of any Seller or its Subsidiaries), such Seller or its Subsidiaries
shall use reasonable best efforts, if so requested by Buyer, to make claims
under such policies, subject to the terms and conditions of such policies;
provided that Buyer (i) shall promptly give Sellers notice in writing of any
events or circumstances in respect of which Buyer has requested any Seller to
make a claim pursuant to this Section 4.6, (ii) shall be responsible for all
uninsured or uncovered amounts for such claims (including any applicable
deductibles that are not covered by any insurance policies of any Seller or
its Subsidiaries), and (iii) shall reimburse each Seller and its Subsidiaries
for any documented increased costs incurred by any Seller or any member of the
Seller Group as a result of such claims. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers
shall retain all rights to control their insurance policies, including the
right to exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve
disputes with respect to any of such policies, notwithstanding whether any
such policies apply to any liabilities of the Business; provided that Sellers
and the other members of the Seller Group shall (at the cost and expense of
Buyer) provide Buyer and its Affiliates with reasonable cooperation regarding
the processing of each claim pursuant to this Section 4.6. Sellers shall
provide Buyer with 30 days' prior written notice of cancellation or
termination of any such insurance policy's coverage in respect of the Business
(other than an expiration in accordance with its terms) that are on an
"occurrence basis" to the extent termination or cancellation serves to reduce
coverage with respect to any claims based on facts or occurrences arising
prior to Closing. Nothing in this Section 4.6 shall be construed to limit any
Person's right to indemnification under Article 8. 

Section 4.7 Intercompany Accounts; Intercompany Arrangements.

(a) Sellers shall cause all intercompany accounts between any member of the
Seller Group, on the one hand, and any member of the Company Group, on the
other hand, to be settled or otherwise eliminated prior to the Closing in such
a manner as Sellers shall reasonably determine, in each case without any
further Liability to any member of the Seller Group, on the one hand, or to
any member of the Company Group, on the other hand (for the avoidance of
doubt, intercompany accounts between or among any members of the Company Group
shall not be affected by this Section 4.7(a)), except for (i) trade accounts
receivable and trade accounts payable incurred in the ordinary course of
business on arm's length terms and included in the calculation of the Closing
Working Capital, which accounts shall remain outstanding in accordance with
their terms and (ii) the Extraction Notes.

(b) Effective as of the Closing, other than (x) this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the Tax Consolidation Exit Agreement and (y) as otherwise set
forth in Section 4.7(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (which Section may be
amended from time to time prior to the Closing to reflect any additions or
deletions mutually agreed between Sellers and Buyer), (i) all agreements,
commitments and other arrangements required to be set forth in Section 2.19(a)
of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall be terminated, without any party having
any continuing obligations thereunder, and (ii) the parties thereto shall no
longer receive any benefits under any such contracts, agreements,
arrangements, commitments, instruments or other obligations.

(c) Following Closing, Sellers shall (or shall cause another member of the
Seller Group) to use its reasonable best efforts to collect the Excluded
Accounts Receivable and pay to Buyer, promptly following receipt thereof, all
after tax proceeds received by members of the Seller Group in respect of the
Excluded Accounts Receivable.

Section 4.8 Termination of Guarantees. From and after the date of this
Agreement, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as of the
Closing, the termination of, and full release of each member of the Seller
Group from, all obligations of any member of the Seller Group arising under
all guarantees, arrangements, keepwells, letters of credit, indemnity or
contribution agreements, support agreements, comfort letters, insurance surety
bonds or other contingent obligations made in respect of the obligations of,
or for the benefit of any oblige of, the Business or any of the Companies or
the Transferred Subsidiaries in respect of the Business by any member of the
Seller Group, including those set forth in Section 4.8 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, which list may be supplemented by written notice from the
Sellers after the date hereof and at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date of any such guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter
of credit, letter of comfort or other similar obligation relating to the
Business entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice and for which the aggregate face
amount shall not exceed $5 million in the aggregate for all such arrangements
(it being understood for the avoidance of doubt, that (x) any such
supplementary notice shall not otherwise modify the Seller Disclosure Letter,
and (y) notwithstanding the foregoing subclause (x) to the contrary, the
Seller shall not be deemed to be in breach of a representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement merely as a result of the creation of such credit
support arrangement permitted to be included in any such notice contemplated
by this Section 4.8) 

(collectively, the "Seller Guarantees"). Such efforts shall include an offer
by Buyer (or by a Subsidiary of Buyer) to substitute its own obligations for
those of each Seller and the other members of the Seller Group under each
Seller Guarantee that is set forth in Section 4.8 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter on terms that are not materially less favorable than the terms that
apply to any Seller or the other members of the Seller Group. If Buyer is
unable to effect such a release and substitution on or prior to Closing with
respect to any letter of credit that constitutes a Seller Guarantee (any such
letter of credit, an "Unreleased Letter of Credit"), Buyer shall, as promptly
as practicable, obtain and deliver to Sellers a letter of credit, with a face
amount equal to the face amount of such Unreleased Letter of Credit and with
an expiration date that is not sooner than the expiration date of such
Unreleased Letter of Credit, and on such other terms and from financial
institutions reasonably satisfactory to Sellers; provided that Buyer shall not
be required to obtain and deliver to Sellers letters of credit pursuant to
this sentence with aggregate face amounts in excess of $5 million. Without
limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall forever
indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and the other members of the Seller
Group against any amounts payable following the Closing by the Sellers and the
other members of the Seller Group by reason of or arising out of or in
consequence of (i) the Seller Guarantees set forth in Section 4.8 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, (ii) any claim or demand for payment made on the
Sellers or any other member of the Seller Group following the Closing with
respect to any of the Seller Guarantees set forth in Section 4.8 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter and (iii) any claim, action or proceeding initiated
following the Closing by any Person who is or claims to be entitled to the
benefit of or claims to be entitled to payment, reimbursement or indemnity
with respect to any Seller Guarantees set forth in Section 4.8 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter.

Section 4.9 Use of Names and Marks.

(a) Except as expressly provided herein, in the Ancillary Agreements or
Section 4.7(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter (or as the Buyer, Seller and
any of their respective Affiliates may otherwise agree in writing from time to
time after the Closing), in no event shall (i) Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries (including after the Closing, the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries) have any right to use, nor shall Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries (including after the Closing, the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries) use, the Names and Source Identifiers set forth in Section
4.9(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, or any other Names and Source
Identifiers that are confusingly similar to such Names and Source Identifiers
(other than after the Closing, the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries)
(collectively, the "Seller Names and Marks" ), all of which are and shall
remain the sole property of the members of the Seller Group or (ii) any member
of the Seller Group have any right to use, nor shall any member of the Seller
Group use, the Names and Source Identifiers set forth in Section 4.9(a)(ii) of
the Seller Disclosure Letter, or any other Names and Source Identifiers that
are confusingly similar to such Names and Source Identifiers (collectively,
the "Transferred Names and Marks"). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence,
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries may utilize in the conduct of
the Business, and each member of the Seller Group may utilize in the conduct
of their Retained businesses, existing stationery, business cards, signage,
advertising materials, inventory, packaging, product, service and training
literature, and other similar materials bearing the Seller Names and Marks
("Seller Materials") or the Transferred Names and Marks ("Buyer Materials"),
respectively, following the Closing until the existing supply of such items is
depleted or, in the 

case of signage, until the date that is ninety (90) days from the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 4.9(a) shall
preclude any of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries, or any member
of the Seller Group, from use of the Seller Names and Marks or the Transferred
Names and Marks, respectively, to the extent such use involves (i) the use of
equipment and other similar articles used in the Business (or in the case of
the Transferred Names and Marks, used in Retained Businesses of the members of
the Seller Group), notwithstanding that they may bear one or more of the
Seller Names and Marks or Transferred Names and Marks; (ii) the appearance of
the Seller Names and Marks or Transferred Names and Marks, as applicable, on
any tools, dies, engineering/manufacturing drawings, manuals, work sheets,
operating procedures, other written or electronic data, materials or assets
(including computer source code) that are used for internal purposes only in
connection with the Business (or in the case of the Transferred Names and
Marks, used in Retained Businesses of the members of the Seller Group); (iii)
the appearance of the Seller Names and Marks or Transferred Names and Marks,
as applicable, in or on any Third Party's publications, marketing materials,
brochures, instruction sheets, equipment or products that were distributed in
the ordinary course of business or pursuant to a contract prior to the Closing
Date, and that generally are in the public domain, or any other similar uses
by any such Third Party over which Buyer or the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or members of the Seller Group, on the other
hand, has no control; or (iv) the use of a Seller Name and Mark or Transferred
Name and Mark in a non-trademark manner including for purposes of conveying to
customers or the general public that the Business is no longer affiliated with
Sellers, and/or to reference historical details concerning or make historical
reference to the Business. The foregoing permitted uses are subject to (I)
compliance by Buyer, the Companies and their Subsidiaries with the quality
control requirements and guidelines in effect for the Seller Names and Marks
as of the Closing Date and compliance by the members of the Seller Group with
the quality control requirements and guidelines in effect for the Transferred
Names and Marks as of the Closing Date and (II) to the extent reasonably
practicable, the placement of a mutually agreed upon disclaimer on such Seller
Materials and Buyer Materials identifying in a readily observable manner that
the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Sellers,
on the other hand, are no longer affiliated with each other.

(b) Any goodwill arising from the use of the Seller Names and Marks by Buyer,
the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries shall inure to the benefit of
Sellers. Any goodwill arising from the use of the Transferred Names and Marks
by any member of the Seller Group shall inure to the benefit of Buyer. Neither
Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries (including after the Closing, the Companies
and the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall contest the ownership or validity of
any rights of any member of the Seller Group in or to the Seller Names and
Marks. No member of the Seller Group shall contest the ownership or validity
of any rights of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries in or to the Transferred
Names and Marks.

(c) The parties hereto acknowledge that any damage caused to any member of the
Seller Group by reason of the breach by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including after the Closing, the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries),
or damage caused to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of the breach
by any member of the Seller Group, of this Section 4.9 would cause irreparable
harm that could not be adequately compensated for in money damages alone.
Therefore, each party agrees that, in addition to any other remedies, at law
or otherwise, 

Sellers or Buyer, whichever is so damaged, shall be entitled to an injunction
issued by a court of competent jurisdiction restraining and enjoining any
violation by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including after the Closing,
the Companies and their Subsidiaries), or by any member of the Seller Group,
as applicable, of this Section 4.9. Buyer further agrees, and will cause its
Subsidiaries (including after the Closing, the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries) to further agree that, they will stipulate to the fact that any
member of the Seller Group has been irreparably harmed by such violation and
not oppose the granting of such injunctive relief. Each Seller further agrees,
and will cause the other members of the Seller Group to further agree that,
they will stipulate to the fact that Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including after the Closing, the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries)
have been irreparably harmed by such violation and not oppose the granting of
such injunctive relief. In addition, Buyer hereby waives, and will cause its
Subsidiaries (including after the Closing, the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries) to waive, any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy. In addition, each Seller hereby waives,
and will cause the other members of the Seller Group to waive, any requirement
for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.

Section 4.10 Buyer's Financing Activities.

(a) Buyer shall not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Debt Financing Commitment without
the prior written consent of Sellers, if such amendment, modification or
waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, including
by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the
Debt Financing (or payment of fees having similar effect) in each case, other
than any such fees or original discount that is paid or otherwise funded by
sources other than the Debt Financing, in each case other than pursuant to any
"flex" provisions, or (ii) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise
amend, modify or expand any conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay (taking into
account the Marketing Period) or prevent the Closing when required pursuant to
Section 1.2(a) or (B) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or the
definitive agreements with respect thereto relative to Buyer's ability to
enforce its rights against such other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment
as in effect on the date hereof or in such definitive agreements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may, without the consent of Sellers,
replace, supplement or amend the Debt Financing Commitment (i) to add lenders,
lead arrangers, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed
the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof (including the replacement
of a lender), (ii) for the implementation or exercise of any "flex" provisions
provided in the Debt Financing Commitment or related fee letters as in effect
on the date hereof, or (iii) so long as such replacement, supplement or
amendment does not (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount of the Debt Financing (or payment of fees having similar effect) in
each case, other than any such fees or original discount that is paid or
otherwise funded by sources other than the Debt Financing), (B) impose new or
additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to
the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (1) delay (taking into account the Marketing Period) or prevent
the Closing when required pursuant to Section 1.2(a) or (2) adversely impact
the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights against the other 

parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive agreements with
respect thereto relative to Buyer's ability to enforce its rights against such
other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment as in effect on the date hereof
or in such definitive agreements. For purposes of this Agreement, references
to "Debt Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitments, as hereafter amended, supplemented, modified or waived
to the extent such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver is permitted
by this Section 4.10(a) and references to "Debt Financing Commitment" shall
include such documents as hereafter amended, modified, supplemented or waived
to the extent permitted by this Section 4.10(a). Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt Financing including (i) maintaining
in effect the Debt Financing Commitment in accordance with its terms, (ii)
satisfying (or obtaining a waiver of) all conditions applicable to Buyer in
the Debt Financing Commitment and otherwise complying in all material respects
with its obligations thereunder, in each case, that are within Buyer's
control, (iii) subject to the satisfaction of all conditions or waiver of the
conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment and Buyer being required
to consummate the Closing pursuant to Section 1.2(a), enforcing their rights
under the Debt Financing Commitment and (iv) subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment and Buyer
being required to consummate the Closing pursuant to Section 1.2(a), direct
the lenders and other Persons providing the Debt Financing to fund on or
before the Closing Date the Debt Financing contemplated to be funded on the
Closing Date by the Debt Financing Commitment (or such lesser amount as may be
required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby). If any portion
of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment
(other than on account of a breach by the Seller of this Agreement which
prevents or renders impracticable the consummation of the Debt Financing),
Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers of such unavailability and, to their
knowledge, the reasons thereof, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
obtain alternative debt financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient (when taken together with the cash and Cash Equivalents of the
Companies and Transferred Subsidiaries and any then-available Debt Financing
pursuant to any then-existing Debt Financing Commitment) to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Alternative Financing"); provided that
such Alternative Financing shall not contain additional conditions that are
more onerous to Buyer (in the aggregate) to the funding of the Debt Financing
relative to those contained in the Debt Financing Commitment; provided,
further, that in no event shall such reasonable best efforts of Buyer be
deemed or construed to require Buyer to agree to economic terms of the
Alternative Financing that are less favorable in the aggregate than those
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment (including any flex provisions
therein). Buyer shall deliver to Sellers complete and correct copies of all
amendments, supplements, other modifications or agreements pursuant to which
the Debt Financing Commitment or any Alternative Financing shall be made
available to Buyer; provided that fee letters relating to fees with respect to
the Debt Financing Commitment or the Alternative Financing shall be redacted
in a customary manner to remove references to fee amounts, pricing caps and
certain flex and other economic terms (none of which would adversely affect
the conditionality, enforceability, availability or termination of such Debt
Financing Commitment or Alternative Financing, or reduce the aggregate
principal amount thereof). For purposes of this Agreement, references to "Debt
Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Alternative
Financing, as hereafter amended, supplemented, modified or waived to the
extent such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is permitted 

by this Section 4.10(a) and references to "Debt Financing Commitment" shall
include such documents as hereafter amended or supplemented to the extent
permitted by this Section 4.10(a).

For purposes of this Agreement, "Marketing Period" shall mean the first period
of fifteen (15) consecutive calendar days after the date of this Agreement
(none of which calendar days falls within a Blackout Period and provided that
each of November 26, 2015, November 27, 2015, July 1, 2016, July 4, 2016 and
July 5, 2016, shall not constitute calendar days for purposes of the Marketing
Period) throughout which (i) Buyer shall have the Required Financial
Information, (ii) the Required Financial Information is at all times Compliant
and (iii) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 are
satisfied (other than (x) those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at Closing, provided such conditions are then
capable of being satisfied, and (y) from and after the Second End Date, the
Antitrust Conditions); provided, that, the last of such fifteen (15)
consecutive calendar days is not less than three (3) nor more than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the first Business Day of a month; provided, that if
Sellers in good faith reasonably believe that the Marketing Period has
commenced, Sellers may deliver to Buyer a written notice to that effect
(stating when Sellers believes it had commenced), in which case the Marketing
Period shall be deemed to have commenced on the date specified in that notice,
unless Buyer in good faith reasonably believes that the Marketing Period has
not commenced and, within five (5) Business Days following receipt of such
notice from Sellers, delivers a written notice to Sellers to that effect
(stating with reasonable specificity why Buyer reasonably believes the
Marketing Period has not commenced).

(b) Buyer shall keep Sellers reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
of the status of its efforts to consummate the Debt Financing. Buyer shall
give Sellers prompt oral or written notice after the occurrence of any of the
following: (i) any material breach of the Debt Financing Commitments by any
other party to the Debt Financing Commitments of which Buyer becomes aware or
(ii) the receipt of written notice or other written communication from any
Financing Source with respect to any material breach or default, termination
or repudiation by any other party to any of the Debt Financing Commitments.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Companies, the
Transferred Subsidiaries and China Asset Seller to, use its and their
reasonable best efforts to cause its officers, directors, employees,
consultants, legal representatives, and auditors to cooperate with Buyer in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing or Alternative
Financing, in each case at Buyer's sole cost and expense, as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
participate in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one
meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and
prospective lenders of, the Debt Financing and the members of senior
management and other representatives of the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries), conference calls, presentations, road shows, drafting sessions,
presentations, rating agency presentations and due diligence sessions and
sessions with prospective financing sources and investors; (ii) furnish Buyer
and their Financing Sources as promptly as practicable with financial and
other pertinent information regarding the Business, the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Buyer and
reasonably available to the Sellers (including the Required Financial
Information); (iii) assist Buyer and their Financing Sources in the
preparation of (a) bank information memoranda, 

confirmations and undertakings in connection with the Required Financial
Information and authorization letters (including with respect to presence or

contained therein), rating agency presentations and lender presentations
relating to the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing and (b) materials
for rating agency presentations and lender presentations relating to the Debt
Financing or the Alternative Financing; (iv) cooperate with the marketing
efforts of Buyer and its Financing Sources for all or any portion of the Debt

of related Liens, including customary payoff letters and (to the extent
required) evidence that notice of such repayment has been timely delivered to
the holders of such Indebtedness and (b) agreements, documents or certificates
that provide for guarantees or that provide for or otherwise facilitate the

the Alternative Financing (including providing reasonable and customary
information required in connection with the pledging and identification of
Owned or Leased Real Property and Intellectual Property as are reasonably
requested by Buyer or the Financing Sources); (vii) provide and execute all
documentation and other information required by bank regulatory authorities
under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act; (viii) assist Buyer in its efforts
to satisfy the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment
to the extent the satisfaction of such conditions requires the cooperation of
or is within the control of Sellers or their Subsidiaries; (ix) cooperate with
the Financing Sources' due diligence investigation, to the extent customary
and reasonable and not unreasonably interfering with the Business; and (x)
take reasonable actions requested by Buyer in order to obtain all corporate,
limited liability company, partnership or other similar approvals and
authorizations by the Companies and Transferred Subsidiaries that are
reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing or
Alternative Financing, including approval of the provision of guarantees and
the pledging of collateral by the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries
(provided, that the effectiveness of such approvals and authorizations is
conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing); provided that Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates from and against any
and all obligations and Losses actually suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing and any
information utilized in connection therewith (except to the extent suffered or
incurred as a result of any such indemnitee's, or such indemnitee's respective
representative's, bad faith or willful misconduct). Buyer shall, promptly upon
Sellers' request, reimburse Sellers for all reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs incurred by Sellers and their Affiliates in connection with such
cooperation (other than with respect to (x) the Sellers' obligations to
deliver interim financial statements pursuant to Section 4.2(a), and (y) the
compensation of the Sellers and their Affiliates' respective employees).
Sellers and the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries hereby (x) consent
to the use of the Companies' and the Transferred Subsidiaries' logos in
connection with the Debt Financing or the Alternative Financing; provided that
such logos are used in a manner that is not intended to nor reasonably likely
to harm or disparage the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries and (y)
expressly 

authorize the use of the financial statements and other information to be
provided pursuant to this clause (c) for purposes of the Debt Financing or the
Alternative Financing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement (including the foregoing) to
the contrary, (i) nothing in this Agreement shall require any such cooperation
to the extent that it would (A) unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
business or operations of the Sellers, the Companies, the Transferred
Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates, (B) require the Sellers, the
Companies, the Transferred Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates to take any
action that will conflict with or violate their respective Organizational

foregoing shall not prevent such Persons from seeking any consents reasonably
requested by the Buyer in connection with the Debt Financing), (C) result in

Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates incurring any personal liability with
respect to any matters relating to the Debt Financing, (D) require the Sellers

and (B) has at the time of acquisition less than $20,000,000 per fiscal year

months after its acquisition of such Person or business (it being agreed that
Seller or such other member of the Seller Group shall inform Buyer of its
intention to divest such Competing Business and shall consider in good faith

the sale to a Third Party of any member of the Seller Group that is not a
party hereto (other than PSSC) occurring during the Non-Compete Period,
Sellers shall cause such member of the Seller Group to execute and deliver to
Buyer a written agreement to be bound by Section 4.10(c).

the thresholds set forth in either of Sections 4.11(c)(ii)(A) or (B) or (y)
any member of the Seller Group brings any Litigation that contests the
enforceability or validity under applicable Law of this Section 4.11(e), and
upon such cessation, any such Permitted Acquisition shall become subject to
the divestiture requirements of Section 4.11(c)(iii) (provided that, for the
purpose of such divestiture requirement, the twelve (12) month period in such
Section 4.11(c)(iii) shall be deemed to run from the date of such cessation).

(f) Each of Sellers and Buyer acknowledge and agree that the covenants set
forth in this Section 4.11 are necessary for the reasonable protection of the
other party and are a material inducement for the other party to enter into
this Agreement. Each of Sellers and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
other party may not have an adequate remedy at Law for any breach or
threatened or attempted breach of the covenants and agreements set forth in
this Section 4.11, and that the other party shall, in addition to the other
remedies that may be available to it under this Agreement or applicable Law,
be entitled to equitable relief, including specific performance or injunctive
relief for the enforcement of the covenants set forth in this Section 4.11.
Each of Sellers and Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the time, scope and
geographic area of the covenants set forth in this Section 4.11 are
reasonable, and if any such covenant is held to be unenforceable by reason of
time, scope or geographic area, then such covenant shall be interpreted to
extend to the maximum time, scope and geographic area for which it may be
enforced as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
determination, and such covenant shall only apply in its reduced form. In the
event of a breach or violation of this Section 4.11, the duration of the
applicable covenant in this Section 4.11 shall be tolled with respect to the
applicable covenant for the duration of such breach or violation. 

Section 4.12 No Solicitation: Other Bidders. No Seller shall, or shall permit

agents or representatives to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, initiate,
seek, respond to or take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission
of any Acquisition Proposal, (b) enter into, continue or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, furnish any confidential information
relating to the Business or afford access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Business or the Companies or any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries to, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage
any effort by, any Person (other than Buyer and its Subsidiaries) in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, (c) grant any waiver or release under
any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Companies or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or (d)
enter into any agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or
term sheet with respect to, or consummate, an Acquisition Proposal, or, in the
case of each of clauses (a) through (d) above, authorize or permit the same.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Sellers shall, and
shall cause the other members of the Seller Group and the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries and their respective representatives and advisors to
(i) immediately cease and terminate all communications, discussions or
negotiations with any other bidder or prospective acquirer (including any
representatives, advisors or financing sources of or to any of such other
bidders or prospective acquirers, in their capacity as such) of the Business
or any of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Other Bidders"), (ii) immediately terminate access by such Other Bidders to
any due diligence materials (including electronic or online data rooms), and
the management personnel and facilities of the Business, and (iii) within five
(5) Business Days following the date hereof, request the return or destruction
of all confidential information provided to any of such Other Bidders.

Section 4.13 Further Actions. From the date hereof through the Closing, (a)
Sellers and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to (i)
refrain from taking any actions that would reasonably be expected to impair,
delay or impede the Closing and (ii) without limiting the foregoing, use
reasonable best efforts to cause all conditions to Closing to be satisfied
(but not waived) as promptly as practicable and in any event on or before the
End Date and (b) each party shall keep the other reasonably apprised of the
status of the matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including with respect to satisfaction of the conditions
to Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement,
each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken
all actions, and to do or cause to be done all other things, necessary, proper
or advisable in order for such party to fulfill and perform its respective
obligations in respect of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
including to cause the conditions to their respective obligations set forth in
Article 6 to be satisfied (and not waived) and otherwise to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as promptly as
practicable, including negotiating in good faith, and using reasonable best
efforts to reach agreement, concerning the final form of (i) any Ancillary
Agreement (or any portion of any Ancillary Agreement) that is currently
incomplete or in term sheet form and (ii) the Extraction Notes. From time to
time after the Closing Date, at the request of another party, without further
consideration and at the expense of the party so requesting, each of the
parties shall execute and deliver to such requesting party, or shall cause to
be executed and delivered to such requesting party, such additional
instruments or documents, and shall take or cause to be taken such other
action, as 

such requesting party may reasonably request in order to consummate more
effectively the transactions contemplated hereby (it being understood, for the
avoidance of doubt, that nothing in this Agreement to the contrary shall
require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to transfer or assign any assets or
properties of the Business or any right in respect thereof or thereunder that
was or is, as of the date of this Agreement, the Closing Date or the date upon
which such request for transfer or assignment was made, material to the value
or operations of the Business). Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign
any asset or property of the Business or the Retained Businesses, as
applicable, or any right in respect thereof or thereunder as to which the
transfer or attempted assignment, without obtaining any consent of any Third
Party, would constitute a breach thereunder. Sellers and Buyer will use their
reasonable best efforts (but without payment of money by Buyer or Sellers) to
obtain the consent of such Persons for the assignment of such asset or
property of the Business or the Retained Business, as applicable, or any right
in respect thereof or thereunder. If such consent is not obtained, or if an
attempted assignment thereof would be ineffective (whether in furtherance of
its acquisition of the Business or whether in order to further effectuate the
Pre-Closing Restructuring), Sellers and Buyer will cooperate in an arrangement
reasonably acceptable to both parties under which Buyer would have the same
benefits and obligations as though such assignment or transfer had occurred in
connection with the Closing.

Section 4.14 Pre-Closing Restructuring. Sellers shall consummate or cause to
be consummated the transactions described on Exhibit A (such transactions set
forth on Exhibit A, as the same may be amended (i) by mutual agreement between
the US Seller and Buyer from time to time in accordance with Section 10.2 or
(ii) by Seller from time to time prior to the Closing with the written consent
of Buyer (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), being referred to as the "Pre-Closing Restructuring") no later than
immediately prior to the Closing. The Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries shall declare and pay such dividends and make such distributions
as are necessary in order to distribute, immediately prior to the Closing, all
cash in the Company Group that is in excess of Minimum Cash (provided, for the
avoidance of doubt, that such distributions shall be made and payable solely
in cash and be paid prior to the Closing). Sellers and Buyers agree to use
reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith between signing and Closing in
order to determine whether the Pre-Closing Restructuring can be implemented in
the manner described on Exhibit L (rather than as described on Exhibit A)
(such transactions set forth on Exhibit L being referred to as the
"Alternative Pre-Closing Restructuring") without adversely affecting any
member of the Seller Group and their respective equity holders. If Sellers
reasonably determine in good faith that the Alternative Pre-Closing
Restructuring may be implemented without adversely affecting any member of the
Seller Group and its respective equity holders, the Sellers and Buyer will
implement the Alternative Pre-Closing Restructuring; provided, that (i) the
incurrence of out-of-pocket expenses by any member of the Seller Group that
are reimbursed by Buyer shall not be considered to adversely affect any member
of the Seller Group or their respective equity holders, (ii) the fact that the
Sellers will own two additional legal entities will not be considered to
adversely affect any member of the Seller Group or its respective equity
holders and (iii) if Sellers reasonably determine that implementation of the
Alternative Pre-Closing Restructuring will adversely affect any member of the
Seller Group or its respective equity holders, Sellers will cooperate
reasonably with Buyer in good faith to identify (and if identified implement) 

an alternative to the Alternative Pre-Closing Restructuring that accomplishes
the same objectives without having such an adverse effect.

Section 4.15 Buyer Insurance. For the three (3) year period following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall, in respect of the Business, maintain insurance or
self-insurance for general product liability and product recall coverage on
terms consistent with such insurance maintained by Seller in respect of the
Business immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (it being understood,
for the avoidance of doubt, that any Buyer retention constituting, or any Loss
covered by, such self-insurance shall not be deemed to be Losses hereunder).

Section 4.16 Later-Discovered IP Assets. To the extent that on or before the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller discovers, or Buyer correctly
determines (and notifies Sellers in writing of such determination), that a
member of the Seller Group owns or controls any Intellectual Property
(excluding the trademarks that are subject to the Trademark Licenses or any
software license used to provide the transition services pursuant to the
Transition Service Agreement or Reverse Transition Service Agreement) that at
the time of Closing (i) was used exclusively or primarily in the Business,
Sellers shall assign or cause such member of the Seller Group to assign, all
of their right, title and interest in and to such Intellectual Property to CST
(or such other entity as designated by CST); provided, however, to the extent
that such Intellectual Property was used by any member of the Seller Group
(other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) in any of the Retained Businesses
such obligation to assign such right, title and interest shall be subject to
CST (or such other entity that is designated by CST to be assigned such
Intellectual Property) entering into a customary perpetual, non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free license agreement with the Seller Group for the use of
such Intellectual Property in the Retained Businesses and natural extensions
thereof or (ii) was used in the Business but was not used exclusively or
primarily in the Business, Sellers shall, or shall cause such member of the
Seller Group to, enter into a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-
free license agreement with CST or its designee granting CST or such designee
the right to use such Intellectual Property in the Business and natural
extensions thereof.

ARTICLE 5. 
TAX MATTERS

Section 5.1 Straddle Periods. Items of income, gain, loss, deduction,
allowance and exemption for any Straddle Period shall be apportioned between
the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the remaining portion of such Tax year or
period in the following manner: (a) the amount of Taxes of the Companies or
the Transferred Subsidiaries based on or measured by income, gross or net
sales, payroll, or payments or receipts for taxable periods (or potions
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date shall be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-
through entity in which a Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and (b) in the
case of any other Taxes of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries
(e.g., real and personal property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes that relate
to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing
shall be determined on a per diem basis (i.e., deemed to be the amount of such
Tax or the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the 

Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period). For the avoidance of doubt, Company Group Transaction
Expenses, to the extent deductible for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes,
shall, unless otherwise required by Law, be apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

Section 5.2 Tax Returns. Sellers shall be responsible for (i) preparing and
timely filing all Consolidated or Combined Returns that are due after the
Closing (taking into account valid extensions) and (ii) preparing all Income
Tax Returns of CST and its U.S. Subsidiaries that are due after the Closing
(taking into account valid extensions) and relate to taxable periods ending on
or before the Closing Date. Such Income Tax Returns, and the portions of any
Consolidated or Combined Returns involving a Company or any Transferred
Subsidiary and that relate to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending
on or before the Closing Date, shall be prepared in accordance with past
practice except as required by applicable Tax Law. At least fifteen (15) days
prior to the due date for any such Income Tax Return or for any such
Consolidated or Combined Return that includes a Company or a Transferred
Subsidiary, Sellers shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) a draft copy of
each such Return (or, in the case of a Consolidated or Combined Return, a pro
forma return limited to the Company or Transferred Subsidiaries that are
included in such Consolidated or Combined Return) to Buyer for Buyer's review
and comment. Any such Tax Return (or, in the case of a Consolidated or
Combined Return, the pro forma return) shall be subject to Buyer's approval
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer
shall cause the Companies and Transferred Companies to timely file any such
Income Tax Returns timely provided by Sellers that relate to taxable periods
ending on or before the Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible for preparing
and timely filing all other Tax Returns of the Companies and the Transferred
Subsidiaries that are due after the Closing (taking into account valid
extensions) and relate to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date, including, for the avoidance of doubt, all Income Tax
Returns of the European Companies and of the non-U.S. Subsidiaries of CST, but
excluding, in any case, any Consolidated or Combined Returns. Such Tax Returns
shall be prepared in accordance with past practice except as required by
applicable Tax Law and shall be prepared (w) in the case of Kavlico GmbH, by
PwC, (x) in the case of Crydom SSR, by BDO, (y) in the case of BEI France, by
Lexcase and (z) in the case of CST's Mexican Subsidiaries, by Ernst and Young.
At least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for any such Tax Return
(taking into account any valid extensions), Buyer shall deliver (or cause to
be delivered) a draft copy of each such Tax Return that is an Income Tax
Return or is otherwise a material Tax Return to Sellers for Sellers' review,
comment and approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Except as required by applicable Tax Law, Buyer and the Companies
shall accept any comments to such Tax Returns that are reasonably requested by
Sellers in writing at least five (5) days prior to filing such Tax Returns;
provided that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Buyer, the Companies or
the Transferred Subsidiaries from timely filing any Tax Return as prepared by
Buyer (it being understood that if Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve any
dispute regarding the preparation of any such Tax Return, such Tax Return
shall be timely filed as prepared by Buyer, subject to later amendment to
reflect the final resolution of any dispute with respect thereto). Except as
required by a final determination resulting from a Tax audit or other
proceeding, without Sellers' prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries) to, amend any Income Tax Returns or other Tax
Returns of the 

Company Group or make or change any Income Tax Return or other Tax election or
accounting methods of the Company Group, in each case if such action is (i)
with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before
the Closing Date, and (ii) reasonably expected to result in (x) an indemnity
obligation of Sellers with respect to Taxes under this Agreement or (y) an
increase in Income Taxes of the Sellers or any member of the Seller Group. The
parties hereto agree to elect out of the installment sale method for all
applicable Tax purposes with respect to any gain realized in connection with
the Pre-Closing Restructuring (including in relation to the Extraction Notes).

Section 5.3 Tax Contests. Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, shall notify
each other promptly upon receipt by them or any of their Affiliates of notice
of any pending audit, examination, notice of deficiency, adjustment,
assessment, redetermination, suit or other proceeding relating to Taxes for
which such other party or parties, or their Affiliates, may be responsible
pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to Article 8) or pursuant to
applicable Law (each, a "Tax Contest"). As between Sellers and its Affiliates,
on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries), on the other, the party that would be responsible
(including under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement) for more
than half of the amounts at issue in a Tax Contest (based on a reasonable
estimation of the amounts expected to be at issue) shall have, at its sole
cost, the exclusive right to control such Tax Contest; provided that the other
party shall have, at its sole cost, the right to participate in any such Tax
Contest. The controlling party shall (i) keep the other party informed of the
progress of any such Tax Contest in a timely manner, (ii) promptly provide
copies of all correspondence or other documents relating to such Tax Contest
to such other party, (iii) promptly provide notice to such other party of any
scheduled meetings (whether telephonic or in person) with any Taxing Authority
relating to such Tax Contest, and (iv) not settle any such Tax Contest without
the other party's prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that, for any such Tax Contest
relating to a Consolidated or Combined Return, Buyer's rights under this
Section 5.3 shall be applicable only to the extent related to a Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary; provided, further, however, that Sellers shall have
the sole and exclusive right under this Section 5.3 to control, settle and
compromise any Tax Contest relating solely to a French Consolidated or
Combined Return.

Section 5.4 Tax Refunds. Any cash refund of Taxes (or credits in lieu thereof)
received by Buyer or any of the Companies or Transferred Subsidiaries of Taxes
paid by the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries with respect to any
taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date,
including any refund or credit attributable to estimated Income Taxes paid
with respect to such periods (other than any refund or credit attributable to
any loss in a taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date applied (e.g., as a carryback) to income in a taxable period (or portion
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date) shall be delivered to the
Sellers, net of any Taxes (including withholding Taxes) and reasonable out of
pocket expenses of Buyer, the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries
attributable to such refund or credit promptly after receipt of such refund
from the applicable Taxing Authority (or, in the case of such a credit, after
the filing of the Tax Return claiming such credit). Buyer shall, and after the
Closing shall use its reasonably commercial efforts to cause its Affiliates
(including the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries) to, use its and
their reasonably commercial efforts to obtain any such refunds or credits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not be entitled to any such
refund of non-Income Taxes (or credits in lieu thereof) unless and to the
extent such refund (or credit) was 

properly requested or claimed on a Tax Return timely filed on or before the
first anniversary date of the Closing Date.

Section 5.5 Books and Records; Cooperation. Subject to Section 4.2(b)(iii),
Buyer and Sellers shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to), at
the requesting party's cost, (a) promptly provide the other party and its
Affiliates with such information, records, documents or assistance as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, signing and filing of
any Tax Return or any audit or other examination by any Taxing Authority or
any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to Taxes or in connection
with other legitimate matters related to Taxes and (b) retain for a period of
seven years after the Closing Date all records or information which may be
relevant to such Tax Return, audit, examination or proceeding, provided that
the foregoing shall be done in a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably
with the conduct of the business of the parties; provided that the Buyer's and
Sellers' obligations pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall terminate upon the
seven year anniversary date of the Closing Date.

Section 5.6 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, value-
added, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and all conveyance fees,
recording charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (including any Real
Property transfer tax and any similar Tax but, for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding any capital gain Taxes imposed with respect to the sale of the
Shares under this Agreement) (such non-excluded Taxes, fees and charges,
"Transfer Taxes") shall be borne by Buyer when due, and Buyer shall prepare
and file all such Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Taxes and fees; provided, however, that US Seller, rather than Buyer, shall
bear any Transfer Taxes imposed as a result of the Pre-Closing Restructuring
and shall prepare and file any Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect thereto; provided further, that if such Tax Returns or other
documentation is not filed before the Closing Date, the preparation and filing
of such Tax Returns or other documentation shall be governed by Section 5.2.
If required by applicable Law, the other parties will, and will cause their
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to mitigate
or to qualify for any exemption from such Transfer Taxes. For each Tax Return
or other filing made with respect to Transfer Taxes, the filing party shall
within thirty (30) Business Days following the Closing Date (or, if later, the
due date for such Tax Return) provide evidence satisfactory to the non-filing
parties that such Tax Returns and filings with respect to Transfer Taxes have
been duly and timely filed and the relevant Transfer Taxes duly and timely
paid. Immediately following any post-Closing adjustment to the Purchase Price,
the parties hereto agree to promptly determine in good faith whether any
specific formality shall be required as a result of such adjustment in order
to enable the filing party to comply with the required additional publicity or
registration formalities pursuant to applicable Laws or to request from the
relevant Governmental Authority a refund of unduly paid Transfer Taxes. Upon
request, the filing party will provide to the other parties, within thirty
(30) days following the expiration of the applicable deadline to proceed to
any such publicity or registration formalities pursuant to applicable Law,
copies of any documentation evidencing the performance of such formalities.

Section 5.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. To the extent permitted under
applicable Tax Law, the parties agree to treat any indemnity payment made
under Article 8 as an 

adjustment to the Purchase Price for all federal, state, local and non-U.S.
applicable Tax purposes, and the parties agree to, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, file their Tax Returns accordingly.

Section 5.8 Tax Agreements and Powers of Attorney. On or prior to the Closing
Date, Sellers shall terminate or cause to be terminated all Tax Sharing
Agreements and all powers of attorney with respect to Taxes relating to the
Companies or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries, in each case such that none
of the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries shall have any obligations
thereunder following the Closing, subject for the avoidance of doubt to the
provisions of the Tax Consolidation Exit Agreement.

Section 5.9 French Tax Consolidation. The parties shall pay all liabilities in
respect of the impot sur les societes referred to in Article 205 of the French
tax code (code general des impots) and contributions additionnelles referred
to in Articles 235 ter ZC and 235 ter ZAA of the French tax code (code general
des impots) (the "French Income Tax") installments (acomptes) with respect to
BEI France for the full calendar year in which the Closing occurs (the
"Closing Year") as required in the Tax Consolidation Exit Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the amount of installments payments made by BEI France to
Custom Sensors and Technologies S.A.S. during the period running from January 1,
2015 to the Closing Date shall be reflected as a current Tax asset in the
Closing Working Capital on the Closing Statement.

Section 5.10 Overlap. To the extent of any inconsistency between this Article
5 and Article 8, this Article 5 shall control as to Tax matters.

TERMINATION

Section 7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing Date:

(a) by the written agreement of Buyer and Sellers;

(b) by either Buyer or Sellers, by written notice to the other party, if:

(i) the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before the End Date;
provided, that, if all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article 6
(other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions
taken at Closing, provided that such conditions are then capable of being
satisfied (assuming the occurrence of the Marketing Period) have been

to terminate this Agreement prior to the Final End Date pursuant to this
Section 7.1(b)(i) unless and until the Marketing Period has ended;

(ii) there shall be any Law (other than an Order) that makes consummation of

(iii) any Order of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction
permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Closing

further, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.1(b)(iii) shall not be available to Sellers or Buyer if the failure of any
Seller or Buyer, respectively, to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement was the primary cause of the issuance of such Order;

(c) by Buyer, by written notice to Sellers, if a breach of any representation
or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of
Sellers set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that, if occurring or
continuing on the Closing Date, would cause the condition set forth in Section
6.2(a) not to be satisfied, and such breach has not been cured within thirty 

(30) days of receipt by Sellers of written notice of such breach from Buyer or
is incapable of being cured prior to the applicable End Date; provided,
however, that Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) if Buyer is then in breach of any

(d) by Sellers, by written notice to Buyer, if a breach of any representation
or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of
Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that, if occurring or

6.3(a) not to be satisfied, and such breach has not been cured within thirty
(30) days of receipt by Buyer of written notice of such breach from Sellers or
is incapable of being cured prior to the applicable End Date; provided,
however, that Sellers shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement

Section 7.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without
liability of any party (or any of its directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, Affiliates, lenders, agents, successors or assigns) to the other
party except as set forth in Section 4.2(e), the indemnification and
reimbursement provisions of Section 4.10, this Section 7.2, Section 7.3,
Article 9 and Article 10; provided, however, that, no such termination shall
relieve any party from liability for (i) failure to perform the obligations of
confidentiality set forth in Section 4.2 or (ii) willful and intentional
breach of this Agreement (it being understood that (x) if the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing provided such
conditions are then capable of being satisfied) are satisfied, the failure of
Buyer to consummate the transactions to be completed at Closing on the date on
which the Closing is to occur pursuant to Section 1.2(a) will be deemed a
willful and intentional breach of this Agreement by Buyer and (y) if the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing provided such conditions are then capable of being satisfied) are
satisfied, the failure of Sellers to consummate the transactions to be
completed at Closing on the date on which the Closing is to occur pursuant to
Section 1.2(a) will be deemed a willful and intentional breach of this
Agreement by Sellers). The provisions of Section 4.2(e), the cost
reimbursement and indemnification provisions of Section 4.10, this Section 

7.2, Section 7.3, Article 9 and Article 10 shall survive any termination
hereof pursuant to Section 7.1; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that no
party shall be entitled to an injunction or specific performance or other
equitable relief under Section 10.10 following termination of the Agreement.

Section 7.3 Reverse Termination Fee.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to (x)
Section 7.1(b)(i) or (y) Section 7.1(b)(ii) or Section 7.1(b)(iii) as a result
of an Order issued under, or related to an action commenced under or pursuant
to, any Competition Law, and, in the case of either clause (x) or (y), at the
time of such valid termination all conditions in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2
(other than (A) those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied
until the Closing, provided such conditions are then capable of being
satisfied, (B) the condition in Section 6.1(a) or (C) the condition in Section
6.1(b) if such condition has not been satisfied as a result of an Order issued
under, or related to an action commenced under or pursuant to, any Competition
Law) are satisfied, then Buyer shall pay to Sellers, by wire transfer of same
day funds to an account or accounts designated by Sellers, an aggregate amount
equal to the Antitrust Reverse Termination Fee within three (3) Business Days
of the date of such termination (it being understood that in no event shall
Buyer be required to pay the Antitrust Reverse Termination Fee more than
once).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise,
in the event that this Agreement is terminated in the circumstances in which
the Antitrust Reverse Termination Fee is payable pursuant to Section 7.3(a)
(i) the right to enforce payment thereof (and any amounts payable pursuant to
Section 7.3(c)) against Buyer shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Sellers and their respective Nonparty Affiliates against Buyer and any
Financing Source, and any of their respective Nonparty Affiliates, in each
case whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement
of any assessment, by any Litigation, by virtue of any Law and whether by or
through any attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by
or on behalf of a party or another Person or otherwise, and (ii) upon payment
of the Antitrust Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.3(a) (and, if
applicable, and any amounts payable pursuant to Section 7.3(c)), none of Buyer
or any Financing Source, or any of their respective Nonparty Affiliates, shall
have any further Liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Debt Financing Commitment or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
or otherwise, in no event will the Sellers or any of their Affiliates be
entitled to seek or receive damages as a remedy in respect of an alleged
breach of Buyer's obligations under Section 4.3, or in connection with any
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(d) or Section 7.1(e) based on an alleged
breach of Buyer's obligations under Section 4.3, that in the aggregate exceed
the amount of the Antitrust Termination Fee.

(c) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the other parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer fails promptly to pay the Antitrust Reverse
Termination Fee when due pursuant to Section 7.3(a) and, in order to obtain
such payment, Sellers commence a suit that results in a judgment against Buyer
for the amount of the Antitrust Reverse Termination Fee, Buyer shall pay to
Sellers, together with the Antitrust Reverse Termination Fee, (i) interest on
the Antitrust Reverse Termination Fee at an 

annual rate equal to the Interest Rate, from the date the Antitrust Reverse
Termination Fee was required to be paid pursuant to Section 7.3(a), and (ii)
Sellers' costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in
connection with such suit.

Section 7.4 Extension; Waiver. Either Sellers or Buyer may (a) extend the time
for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement for their benefit. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party granting such
extension or waiver.

ARTICLE 8. 
INDEMNIFICATION

Section 8.1 Survival. All representations and warranties made in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing until the first anniversary of the Closing

the item in question, and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 2.11 (Intellectual Property) and 2.14 (Environmental Matters), which

required to be performed or complied with prior to the Closing (each such
covenant and agreement described in this sentence, but, for the avoidance of
doubt excluding those contained in Section 1.1 and 4.14, a "Pre-Closing
Covenant") shall survive the Closing until the first anniversary of the
Closing Date. All other respective covenants and agreements of Sellers and
Buyer contained in this Agreement (each such other covenant or agreement, a
"Post-Closing Covenant") shall survive the Closing hereunder indefinitely or,
in the case of any Post-Closing Covenants, for such lesser period of time as
may be specified therein (other than those contained in Section 1.1 and 4.14,
which shall survive indefinitely), but, in either case, not to exceed the
applicable statute of limitations (including any extension thereto) in the
event of a breach of such covenant or other agreement.

Section 8.2 Indemnification by Sellers. From and after the Closing, and
subject to this Article 8, Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and
hold harmless Buyer, each of its Subsidiaries (including the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries) and Affiliates, and Buyer's and each of its
Subsidiaries' and Affiliates' respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees"), from
and against, and shall pay or reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for, any and all
Losses resulting from:

(a) (i) any breach or inaccuracy, of any surviving representation of Sellers
in this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date
(as though then made) (which shall be determined without giving effect to any
item disclosed in Section 2.17(e) of the 

Seller Disclosure Letter), and (ii) any breach or inaccuracy of any surviving
representation of Sellers in the Ancillary Agreements or any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement as of the date thereof;

(b) any breach or default in performance by Sellers of any covenant of Sellers
in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement;

(c) any Company Group Transaction Expenses or Closing Debt not taken into
account in connection with the purchase price adjustment under Section 1.3 of
this Agreement;

(d) Liability resulting from the Pre-Closing Restructuring;

(e) the ownership or operation of any businesses (other than the Business),
including the Retained Businesses, by any member of the Seller Group or, prior
to the Closing, any Company or any Transferred Subsidiary (or, in each case,
any predecessor thereto);

(f) (i) all Income Taxes imposed on the Company Group (or any member thereof)
with respect to taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date (including Income Taxes of the Company Group resulting from the
Pre-Closing Restructuring), (ii) all Income Taxes of any member of an
Affiliated Group of which any Company Group member is or was a member on or
before the Closing Date, including pursuant to Section 1.1502-6 of the
Treasury Regulations, which Income Taxes relate to taxable periods (or
portions thereof) of any such Affiliated Group ending on or before, or that
include, the Closing Date, but excluding Income Taxes of the Companies and the
Transferred Subsidiaries that relate to the portion of any such taxable period
beginning after the Closing Date, (iii) all Income Taxes of any Person imposed
on the Company Group as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise
with respect to taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before to
the Closing Date, (iv) all Income Taxes relating to inclusions under Section
951 of the Code by Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company Group) with
respect to the portion of any Straddle Period of any Subsidiary of CST that is
a "controlled foreign corporation" ending on the Closing Date (for avoidance
of doubt, it being understood that the Income Tax of such portion shall be
determined as if the Straddle Period of such Subsidiary ended on the Closing
Date), reduced by the amount of any net Tax benefit actually realized by Buyer
or its Affiliates attributable to any foreign tax credit related thereto,
taking into account any overall foreign loss (such net Tax benefit determined
by applying the applicable net Tax benefit principles of Section 8.4(d),
applied mutatis mutandis), (v) all Income Taxes arising from any election
under Section 108(i) of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local, or
non-U.S. Tax law) made prior to the Closing Date, or (vi) resulting from any
breach by Sellers of any covenant of Sellers contained in Article 5, other
than, in each case, Income Taxes arising out of (x) any breach or default in
performance by Buyer (or, following the Closing, by the Company Group) of any
of their obligations under this Agreement or (y) any action taken or caused to
be taken by Buyer or the Company Group outside the ordinary course of business
on the Closing Date after the Closing to the extent not contemplated under
this Agreement or carried out or effected without the consent of Sellers;
provided that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for a reduction in or
loss of any net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, or
other Tax attributes in existence as of the Closing Date, but the availability
of any net operating loss carryforwards, 

capital loss carryforwards or other Tax attributes attributable to Tax periods
(or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date shall not be considered
in determining the existence or amount of any Loss; and

(g) the Retained Claims, in an amount not to exceed $1,000,000; and

(h) (i) any Third Party Claim asserted or made prior to the third anniversary
of the Closing Date alleging that products sold by the Business prior to the
Closing failed to conform with applicable Contractual specifications, express
or implied warranties or Law, (ii) any investigation by any Governmental
Authority initiated prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date
concerning allegations that products sold by the Business prior to the Closing
failed to conform with applicable Contractual specifications, express or
implied warranties or Law; provided, that a Buyer Indemnified Party is
notified in writing of such investigation, and provides such notification to
Sellers, prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date and (iii) any
product recall initiated by the Company Group prior to the third anniversary
of the Closing Date related to products sold by the Business prior to the
Closing as a result of the failure of such products to conform with applicable
Contractual specifications, express or implied warranties or Law to the extent
that the decision to initiate such product recall was reasonably consistent
with industry practice or such product recall was required by any Governmental
Authority or the result of any action of any Governmental Authority; provided
that no claim for indemnification may be made under Section 8.2(a) with
respect to any Losses resulting from any breach of representation or warranty
to the extent such Losses also result from the matters described in this
Section 8.2(h).

Section 8.3 Indemnification by Buyer. From and after the Closing, and subject
to this Article 8, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller, its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and its and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnitees"), from and against, and shall pay or reimburse the Seller
Indemnitees for, any and all Losses resulting from:

(a) (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any surviving representation of Buyer in
this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date (as
though then made), and (ii) any breach or inaccuracy of any surviving
representation of Buyer in the Ancillary Agreements or any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement as of the date thereof;

(b) any breach or default in performance by Buyer of any covenant of Buyer in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement;

(c) any Assumed Liability; or

(d) the ownership or conduct of the Business from and after the Closing except
with respect to any matter for which Sellers are required to indemnify the
Buyer Indemnitees or otherwise be responsible for pursuant to this Agreement
or any of the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 8.4 Limitations on Indemnity. Buyer and Sellers agree, for themselves
and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees, as follows: 

(a) No Buyer Indemnitee will assert any claims for indemnification under
Section 8.2(a) (except for claims for indemnification resulting from breach of
any Fundamental Representation, the Tax Representations solely as related to
Income Taxes or Section 2.21 (Sufficiency of Assets)): (i) in respect of any
Loss incurred or suffered by such Buyer Indemnitee that is not a Qualifying
Loss and (ii) until such time as the aggregate of all such Qualifying Losses
that Buyer Indemnitees may have under Section 8.2(a) (except for Losses
resulting from breach of any Fundamental Representation, the Tax
Representations solely as related to Income Taxes or Section 2.21 (Sufficiency
of Assets)) exceeds $5,000,000 (the amount referred to in this clause (ii),
the "Indemnity Threshold"), in which event the Buyer Indemnitees shall only be
entitled to indemnification for such Qualifying Losses in excess of the
Indemnity Threshold. The aggregate liability of Sellers in respect of all
claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.2(a) (except for claims for
indemnification arising out of any breach of any Fundamental Representation,
the Tax Representations solely as related to Income Taxes or Section 2.21
(Sufficiency of Assets)) and Section 8.2(h) shall not exceed $75,000,000 (the
"Cap"). Without limiting the foregoing, no Buyer Indemnitee will assert any
claim for indemnification under Section 8.2(h) or any matter that could give
rise to a claim for breach of any other representation of Sellers that could
also give rise to a claim for indemnification under Section 8.2(h) (a "Product
Liability Claim") until such time as the aggregate of all such Qualifying
Losses that Buyer Indemnitees may have under Section 8.2(a) and Section 8.2(h)
in respect of all Product Liability Claims exceeds $5,000,000, in which event
the Buyer Indemnitees shall only be entitled to indemnification for such
Qualifying Losses in respect of Product Liability Claims in excess of
$5,000,000. For the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnity Threshold will not apply
to Product Liability Claims. The aggregate liability of Sellers for all claims
or Losses under Article 8 (except for Losses resulting from a breach of any
Post-Closing Covenant or Losses under Section 8.2(e)) shall in no event exceed
the Purchase Price.

(b) No Seller Indemnitee will assert any claims for indemnification under
Section 8.3(a) (except for claims for indemnification or arising out of any
breach of any Fundamental Representation): (i) in respect of any Loss incurred
or suffered by such Seller Indemnitee that is not a Qualifying Loss and (ii)
until such time as the aggregate of all such Qualifying Losses that Seller
Indemnitees may have under Section 8.3(a) exceeds an amount equal to the
Indemnity Threshold, in which event the Seller Indemnitees shall only be
entitled to indemnification for such Qualifying Losses in excess of the
Indemnity Threshold. The aggregate liability of Buyer in respect of all claims
for indemnification pursuant to Section 8.3(a) (except for claims for
indemnification arising out of any breach of any Fundamental Representation)
shall not exceed the Cap. The aggregate liability of Buyer for all claims or
Losses under Section 8.3(a) and 8.3(b) (except for Losses resulting from a
breach of any covenant to be performed after the Closing) shall in no event
exceed the Purchase Price.

(c) Any liability for any Loss subject to indemnification under this Article 8
shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of
facts giving rise to such Loss constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of this Agreement. No Person
shall be entitled to any recovery under this Agreement in respect of any Loss
to the extent that such recovery would constitute a duplicative payment of any
amounts included in the calculation of the purchase price adjustment pursuant
to Section 1.3. 

(d) With respect to each indemnification obligation in this Agreement: (i) all
Losses (other than Losses with respect to the China Business) shall be net of
net Tax benefits actually realized by Buyer Indemnitees in connection with the
relevant Losses prior to the making of the applicable indemnity payment;
provided that to the extent any net Tax benefit is actually realized in the
two (2) taxable periods succeeding the taxable period in which such Loss
occurred, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Sellers within thirty
(30) days the amount of such net Tax benefit, reduced by any Taxes (including
withholding Taxes) and expenses related thereto; (ii) all Losses shall be net
of any Eligible Third Party Proceeds and (iii) in no event shall an
Indemnifying Party have liability to the Indemnified Party for any punitive
damages, except if and to the extent any such damages are recovered against an
Indemnified Party pursuant to a Third Party Claim or otherwise paid to any
Third Party, including any Governmental Authority. A Tax benefit shall be
deemed to be actually realized if and to the extent the Buyer Indemnitees'
cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of a taxable period, calculated
by excluding any Tax items attributable to the applicable Loss (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any increase in Tax), exceeds the Buyer Indemnitees'
actual cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such taxable period,
calculated by taking into account any Tax items attributable to the applicable
Loss (to the extent permitted by relevant Tax law and treating such Tax items
attributable to the applicable Loss as the last items claimed for any taxable
period). A Tax benefit shall be realized upon the filing of a Tax Return
claiming such Tax benefit or if the benefit is a refund of previously paid
Taxes, upon the receipt of such refund.

(e) If any portion of Losses to be indemnified or reimbursed by an
Indemnifying Party may be covered, indemnifiable or reimbursable, in whole or
in part, by third-party insurance coverage maintained by the Indemnified Party
or under any Contract indemnity or similar right (other than this Agreement)
available to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give
notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party and if the Indemnifying Party so
requests, the Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts,
at the Indemnifying Party's cost, to recover or collect the maximum amount of
such Losses recoverable under such insurance policy, Contract indemnity or
similar right, in which event all such proceeds actually received, net of
Taxes, and costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in seeking such collection,
shall be considered "Eligible Third Party Proceeds". In any case where an
Indemnified Party recovers from a Third Party any Eligible Third Party
Proceeds in respect of any Losses for which an Indemnifying Party has actually
reimbursed such Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 8, such Indemnified
Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party such Eligible Third
Party Proceeds so recovered, but not in excess of the amount previously paid
by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect
of such claim.

(f) Any Indemnified Party shall use its efforts required by Law to mitigate
any Losses incurred by such party upon and after becoming aware that any event
or condition is reasonably likely to give rise to any indemnification rights
hereunder.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Seller
shall be required to indemnify or hold harmless any Buyer Indemnitees for
Losses arising from or relating to any matter arising under any Environmental
Law, to the extent (i) resulting from any soil or groundwater sampling
conducted by or at the direction of the Buyer Indemnitees, other than any 

such sampling (A) required under applicable Law, (B) required by any
Governmental Authority, (C) approved by a Seller representative in writing, or
(D) reasonably necessary to respond to a Third Party Claim or a general threat
to public health or safety or (ii) Buyer or any of its Affiliates (A)
remediate environmental conditions in excess of industrial standards or other
applicable minimum remedial standards as evidenced by a "no further action"
letter or equivalent sign-off from a Governmental Authority with valid
jurisdiction, including standards based on land use restrictions and
engineering controls where appropriate and available, except where a Buyer is
required to do so under applicable Law or by a Governmental Authority, or (B)
incur costs in excess of those reasonably necessary to bring a condition into
compliance with applicable Environmental Laws and applicable remedial
standards as evidenced by a "no further action" letter or equivalent sign-off
from a Governmental Authority with valid jurisdiction.

(h) No claim for indemnification may be made under Section 8.2 or Section 8.3,
as applicable, for or in respect of any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement after the expiration of the survival period
applicable to such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement (as
provided in Section 8.1); provided that any claim asserted by an Indemnified
Party prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period described
herein shall survive (and be subject to indemnification) until it is finally
and fully resolved.

(i) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, all indemnification payments
made pursuant to this Article 8 shall be treated as adjustments to the
Purchase Price.

(j) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, for purposes of
this Article 8, each representation and warranty in this Agreement (other than
the representations and warranties set forth in clause (b) of Section 2.8
(Absence of Certain Changes) and the second sentence of Section 2.6 (Financial
Statements)) and the Seller Disclosure Letter, Buyer Disclosure Letter and
schedules and exhibits hereto shall be read without regard and without giving
effect to the terms "material", "in all material respects" or "Material
Adverse Effect" or similar phrases contained in such representation or
warranty (as if such words or phrases were deleted from such representation
and warranty).

(k) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers hereby
agree that no Seller Indemnitees will be entitled to seek indemnity,
reimbursement or contribution from the Companies or the Transferred
Subsidiaries or their respective officers or directors for any indemnity or
other obligation for which Sellers are liable to any Buyer Indemnitees under
this Agreement.

Section 8.5 Notification of Claims; Third Party Claims.

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
"Indemnified Party") shall promptly notify the party or parties liable for
such indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of any claim in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Article 8, describing in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject
matter of such claim; provided, however, that the failure to provide such
notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this Article 8 except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by reason of such failure to give timely 

notice. The parties agree that (i) in this Article 8 they intend to shorten
(in the case of the limited survival periods specified in Section 8.1) or
extend (in the case of the unlimited survival periods specified in Section
8.1) the applicable statute of limitations period with respect to certain
claims, (ii) notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement (other than a Post-Closing Covenant) must be
delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period specified
in Section 8.1 for such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, (iii)
notices for claims in respect of a breach of a Post-Closing Covenant must be
delivered prior to the date that is six months after the later of the last day
of the effective period of such Post-Closing Covenant and the date the
Indemnified Party become aware of such breach (provided that this limitation
shall not apply to Section 1.1, or Section 4.14) and (iv) any claims for
indemnification for which notice is not timely delivered in accordance with
the preceding subclauses (i) and (ii) shall be expressly barred and are hereby
waived, provided that if, prior to such applicable date, a party shall have
notified any other party in accordance with the requirements of this Section
8.5(a) of a claim for indemnification under this Article 8 (whether or not
formal legal action shall have been commenced based upon such claim), such
claim shall continue to be subject to indemnification in accordance with this
Article 8 notwithstanding the passing of such applicable date.

(b) Upon receipt of notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Section 8.5 in respect of a pending or threatened claim or
demand by a Third Party that the Indemnified Party has determined has given or
could reasonably give rise to a right of indemnification (other than with
respect to Taxes) under this Agreement (such claim or demand being a "Third
Party Claim" and including without limitation a pending or threatened claim or
demand asserted by a Third Party against the Indemnified Party), the
Indemnifying Party may, by notice to the Indemnified Party delivered within
twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim,
assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claim, with its own counsel
and at its own expense. The Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified
Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense; provided, however,
that the Indemnifying Party shall pay such expenses (i) if the named parties
to any such Third Party Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both
such Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and such Indemnified Party
shall have been advised by its counsel that there may be one or more legal
defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are not available to such
Indemnifying Party, or if available to such Indemnifying Party the assertion
of which would be adverse to or in conflict with the interests of the
Indemnified Party, (ii) if the Indemnified Parties shall have been advised by
counsel that representation of any such Indemnified Parties by the same
counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional
conduct due to actual or potential differing interests between them or (iii)
if the Indemnified Party was requested by the Indemnifying Party to so
participate. The Indemnified Party may take any actions reasonably necessary
to defend such Third Party Claim prior to the time that it receives notice
from the Indemnifying Party as contemplated by the preceding sentence. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), consent to a settlement, compromise or discharge of, or the entry of
any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, unless such settlement,
compromise or discharge is on exclusively monetary terms and does not involve
any finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any 

wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay
or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment
concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement, (ii) not encumber or
agree to encumber any of the assets of any Indemnified Party or agree to any
restriction or condition or other non-monetary relief that would apply to or
adversely affect any Indemnified Party and (iii) obtain, as a condition of any
settlement or other resolution, a complete and unconditional release of each
Indemnified Party from any and all liability in respect of such Third Party
Claim. The Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any claim or demand for which it is
seeking indemnification from the Indemnifying Party or admit to any liability
with respect to such claim or demand without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to control the defense of a Third
Party Claim (and the Indemnified Party shall control such defense (subject to
the right of the Indemnifying Party to approve any settlement thereof (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed))) to the
extent that it (i) seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after
conferring with its outside counsel, cannot reasonably be separated from any
claim for monetary damages, (ii) involves any customer or supplier of the
Business, the Companies or the Transferred Subsidiaries and such Third Party
Claim could reasonably be expected to materially impair Buyer's, any Company's
or any Transferred Subsidiary's relationship with such customer or supplier or
(iii) has a reasonable likelihood of resulting in Losses that (A) would exceed
the Cap or (B) assuming the Indemnity Threshold remains applicable, would not
be likely to cause the Indemnity Threshold to be exceeded, individually or in
the aggregate with any other claims for indemnification that are subject to
the Indemnity Threshold. If the Indemnifying Party does not have the right to
control the defense of a Third Party Claim under this Section 8.5(c), then the
Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity
to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel
and at its own expense; provided, however, the Indemnified Party shall pay
such expenses if the Indemnifying Party was requested by the Indemnified Party
to so participate.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 8 (including
Section 8.1 and Section 8.3), (i) no Indemnifying Party shall have any
liability under this Article 8 for any Losses arising out of or in connection
with any Third Party Claim that is settled or compromised by an Indemnified
Party without the consent of such Indemnifying Party (unless consent was
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (ii) any Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to be fully indemnified and held harmless under this Article
8 for any Losses arising out of or in connection with any Third Party Claim
that is settled or compromised by an Indemnifying Party without the consent of
such Indemnified Party, in each case, provided that such consent was required
pursuant to this Section 8.5 and such requisite consent has not been
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(e) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives notice of a claim for
indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 8.5 that does not
involve a Third Party Claim, the 

Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days
following its receipt of such notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes
its liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article 8. Within the 30-day
period beginning on the date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such
dispute notice, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
reasonably cooperate with and assist each other in determining the validity of
any such claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt to agree upon the rights and
obligations of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims for
indemnity as to which the Indemnifying Party disputes liability, and any
agreement reached regarding their respective rights with respect to any of
such claims shall be set forth in a written agreement signed by the parties.

sale or transfer (by means of a merger, stock sale or otherwise) of all or
substantially all or any material portion of the Business.

Section 10.6 Entire Agreement.

(a) This Agreement (including the Seller Disclosure Letter and the Buyer
Disclosure Letter and the schedules and exhibits hereto), the Ancillary
Agreements (when executed and delivered), any certificates delivered pursuant
to this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreements constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements, understandings and
representations, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof. 

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Letter or the Buyer
Disclosure Letter, no party nor any of its Nonparty Affiliates makes or has
made any representation or warranty whatsoever, whether written or oral,
express or implied, other than those representations and warranties expressly
set forth in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (as applicable), and
no party is relying on any statement, representation or warranty, whether
written or oral, express or implied, made by the other party or such other
party's Nonparty Affiliates, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth herein or therein. In addition, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that (i) Buyer (A) has made its own inquiry and investigations into
and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment concerning the
Companies, the Transferred Subsidiaries, the Business and the Assets, (B) has
been provided with adequate access to such information, documents and other
materials relating to the Companies, their respective Subsidiaries, the
Business and the Assets as it has deemed necessary to enable it to form such
independent judgment, (C) has had such time as Buyer deems necessary and
appropriate to fully and completely review and analyze such information,
documents and other materials and (D) has been provided an opportunity to ask
questions of Seller and its representatives with respect to such information,
documents and other materials and have received satisfactory answers to such
questions, and (ii) except for the representations and warranties expressly
set forth in Article 2, any cost estimates, projections and predictions
contained or referred to in the materials that have been provided or made
available to Buyer by or on behalf of any Seller are not, and shall not be
deemed to be, representations or warranties of Sellers or any of their
Nonparty Affiliates, and none of such Persons has made any representations or
warranties, whether written or oral, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of such information, documents and other materials, except for
the representations and warranties expressly set forth in Article 2.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 10.6 shall limit
Buyer's right to rely on the representations and warranties set forth herein
and to obtain indemnification for breaches thereof in accordance with Article
8 hereof and nothing herein shall operate to limit any claim for fraud.

Section 10.7 Disclosure Letters. Any item or matter disclosed in any section
or subsection of the Seller Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter
shall be deemed disclosed in any other section or subsection only to the
extent that such item or matter is reasonably apparent on its face to be so
applicable to such other section or subsection. The disclosure of any item or
matter in the Seller Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter shall
not be construed as an admission, representation or indication that such item
or other matter is "material" or would have a Material Adverse Effect or that
such item or other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in the
Seller Disclosure Letter or the Buyer Disclosure Letter (as applicable), nor
shall such disclosure establish a standard of materiality for any purpose. The
disclosure of any item or matter relating to any possible breach or violation
of any law or contract shall not be construed by any Third Party as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred.

Section 10.8 Severability. If any provision, including any phrase, sentence,
clause, section or subsection, of this Agreement is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, inoperative or unenforceable for any
reason, such circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering such
provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in any other case
or circumstance, or of rendering any other provision herein contained invalid,
inoperative or unenforceable to any 

extent whatsoever. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

Section 10.9 Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which shall together constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties. Until and
unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party,
this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement
or other communication). Except for (i) Sections 5.1, 8.2 and 8.3, which are
intended to benefit, and to be enforceable by, the parties specified therein,
and (ii) each of the Persons whose liability is limited in accordance with
Sections 7.2 and 7.3 to the extent provided therein, including the Financing
Sources, who shall be express Third Party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to rely on, Sections 7.2, 7.3, 10.2, 10.4, 10.10, 10.11 and this
Section 10.9, this Agreement, together with the Ancillary Agreements and the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto are not intended to confer in or on behalf of
any Person not a party to this Agreement (and their successors and assigns)
any rights, benefits, causes of action or remedies with respect to the subject
matter or any provision hereof.

Section 10.10 Specific Performance.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary
damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties hereto do not perform any provision of this
Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief permitted by this Agreement on the basis that any other party has an
adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with such order or injunction. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event will
the Sellers be entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of
Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing and recover the Antitrust Reverse
Termination Fee.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, including
Section 10.10(a), it is acknowledged and agreed that Sellers shall be entitled
to specific performance of Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing if and
only if (i) the Marketing Period has ended, (ii) the conditions set forth in
Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 (other than those conditions that by 

their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, provided such conditions
are then capable of being satisfied) have been satisfied or waived, (iii)
Sellers stands ready, willing and able consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and have irrevocably confirmed by written
notice to Buyer that they are prepared to consummate the Closing, and (iv)
Buyer shall have failed to consummate the Closing by the date on which the
Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2(a).

Section 10.11 Non-recourse. Except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth
in the Confidentiality Agreement (and, in each case, subject to the respective
terms, conditions and limitations therein and with respect to only the Persons
that are expressly named as parties thereto), all claims, actions,
obligations, Liabilities, Litigation or causes of action (in each case whether
based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any Litigation, by virtue of any Law and whether by or through
any attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on
behalf of a party hereto or another Person or otherwise) that may be based
upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, in connection with or
related in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made
in, in connection with or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be made
only against (and such representations and warranties are those solely of) the
Persons that are expressly identified as parties in the preamble to this
Agreement (and their successors and permitted assigns). No Person who is not a
party hereto, including any past, present or future incorporator, member,
partner, stockholder, equityholder, Affiliate, manager, officer, director,
employee, accountant, counsel, consultant, advisor, representative, agent or
assignee of, and any financial advisor or Financing Source to, any party
hereto, or any past, present or future incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, equityholder, Affiliate, manager, officer, director, employee,
accountant, counsel, consultant, advisor, representative, agent or assignee
of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Nonparty Affiliates"), shall have any Liability (in each
case whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement
of any assessment, by any Litigation, by virtue of any Law and whether by or
through any attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by
or on behalf of a party hereto or another Person or otherwise) for any claims,
actions, obligations, Liabilities, Litigation or causes of action arising
under, out of, in connection with or related in any manner to this Agreement
or based on, in respect of or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation,
execution, performance or breach, and, to the maximum extent permitted by Law,
each party hereto hereby waives and releases all such claims, actions,
obligations, Liabilities, Litigation and causes of action against any such
Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, except to the extent otherwise set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement (and subject to the respective terms, conditions and
limitations therein and with respect to only the Persons expressly named as
parties thereto and their successors and permitted assigns), each party hereto
disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the
performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in

Inventory

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value after
making a reserve for slow moving or obsolete items. Cost includes expenditure
incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing
location and condition and an absorption of manufacturing overhead. A standard
to actual adjustment is made to inventory in order to capitalize variances. 

 

| 
---|--- 

•

|

The inventory reserve shall be calculated as follows: 

| 
---|--- 

◦

|

For inventory held at Tijuana or Moorpark, a forecast annual utilization will
be calculated taking into account actual utilization over the past 24 months.
This annual utilization will be compared to actual quantities of inventory on
hand at the Effective Time to determine the future utilization of those
quantities and a reserve booked as follows: 

| 
---|--- 

▪

|

0% reserve on quantities forecast to be used in less than 12 months 

| 
---|--- 

▪

|

50% reserve on quantities forecast to be used between 12 and 24 months

Exhibit D

FORM OF

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT1

THIS TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of [•] (the "Effective Date") by and between CUSTOM SENSORS and TECHNOLOGIES
LTD., a private limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales
and CROUZET AUTOMATISMES S.A.S., a Societe par Actions Simplifiee organized
under the laws of France (collectively, "Provider"), and Sensata Technologies
Holding N.V., a besloten vennootschap organized under the laws of the
Netherlands ("Buyer") ( "Recipient"). Provider and Recipient are referred to
collectively as the "Parties" and individually as a "Party." Capitalized terms
used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to such
terms in the Purchase Agreement (as defined herein).

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Provider and Recipient, among others, are parties to that certain
Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of [•] (the "Purchase
Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, (i) Provider has agreed to
sell to Recipient, and Recipient has agreed to purchase from Provider, the CST
Shares, (ii) if (and only if) French Seller exercises the European Purchase
Option, French Seller will sell to Recipient, and Recipient will purchase from
French Seller, the European Company Shares and (iii) China Asset Seller has
agreed to sell and convey to Recipient, and Recipient has agreed to purchase
and assume from China Asset Seller, the China Assets and the China
Liabilities; and

WHEREAS, Provider has agreed to provide or to cause one or more of its
Affiliates to provide to Recipient or its Affiliates, including, without
limitation, the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries, from and after the
Effective Date, certain services on a transitional basis on the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises
contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the Parties
agree as follows:

____________________

1 Note to Draft: This form is intended to be used as the basis, subject to
reversing the Parties and other conforming changes, of the Reverse Transition
Services Agreement as well. 



1.Transition Services.



(a)Recipient and the Business will be affected by the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and, following
consummation of the transactions, may not have access to certain support and
services as before such consummation. It is the intent of the Parties to this
Agreement to provide for the smooth and efficient functional separation of the
Business and the retained businesses of Seller and for the efficient operation
of the Business and the retained businesses of Seller during such separation.
To that end, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Provider shall provide, or cause one or more of its Affiliates to
provide, the services set forth on Schedule A2 (the "Transition Services") to
Recipient.



____________________

2 Note to Draft: Buyer and Seller will cooperate in good faith prior to the
Closing Date to further develop the nature and scope of Transition Services to
be provided during the term of the Transition Service Agreement and the
Reverse Transition Service Agreement (in modification of or addition to those
services set forth on the draft Schedule A attached hereto), consistent with
objectives set forth in Section 1(a) and the purposes of this Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, with respect to any services (and only such
services) that (i) are reasonably necessary for Buyer to conduct the Business
with the Companies and the Transferred Subsidiaries, or for the Seller to
conduct the Retained Businesses, (ii) were provided by the Seller Group to the
Business, or by the Business to Seller's Retained Businesses, as previously
conducted at any time during the twelve (12) months prior to the Effective
Time, then such services will be added as additional Transition Services
hereunder. The Parties agree to negotiate in good faith any terms and
conditions regarding the provision of such additional Transition Services, it
being understood and agreed that (x) the cost for any such additional
Transition Service will be determined on a basis consistent with the manner as
the cost for such Transition Service was calculated and allocated to the
Business taken as a whole for purposes of the preparation of the Financial
Statements, and (y) the term of providing such additional Transition Service
will be consistent with the period for which similar Transition Services are
provided as set forth on Schedule A hereto, or as otherwise reasonably
necessary to permit a smooth and efficient transition of the Business and of
such service from the Provider to the Recipient and its Affiliates. With
repect to any Transition Services set forth on the draft Schedule A, the
Parties will (i) to the extent either Buyer or Seller notifies the other that
they reasonably believe it is necessary to specify additional detail with
respect to the Transition Services set forth on Schedule A, negotiate in good
faith to further specify such services and (ii) more fully specify the pricing
with respect to such Transition Services set forth on Schedule A on a basis
consistent with the principles specified thereon. 



(b)In the event a service performed by Provider or an Affiliate prior to the
Closing is not included in the services listed in Schedule A, but is required
for the conduct of the Business3 after the Closing (each an "Omitted
Service"), Provider shall provide, or cause to be provided, such Omitted
Service at Recipient's written request in the same manner (in accordance with
Section 4) as such Omitted Service was previously provided prior to the
Closing Date. Such Omitted Service shall be provided for a fee calculated in
the same manner as the cost of such Omitted Service was calculated and
allocated to the Business taken as a whole for purposes of the preparation of
the Financial Statements. Any Omitted Service provided shall thereafter be
deemed "Transition Services" for all purposes of this Agreement, and Schedule
A shall be amended by the Parties in good faith to reflect any such Omitted
Services.



(c)Recipient acknowledges that Provider may provide the Transition Services
directly, through any of their Affiliates or (subject to the restrictions set
forth in this Agreement) through one or more third parties engaged by Provider
to provide the Transition Services in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.



(d)Subject to the provisions of Article 7, nothing in this Agreement shall
require Provider to perform or cause to be performed any Transition Service if
the provision of such Transition Service by Provider conflicts with or
violates any applicable Law, any contract or agreement to which Provider is a
party or the rights of any third party with respect thereto. If Provider
becomes aware of any potential conflict or violation on the part of Provider,
Provider may suspend or cease providing such Transition Service; provided that
Provider uses commercially reasonable efforts to promptly advise Recipient in
writing of such potential conflict or violation and to cooperate in good faith
with Recipient to implement any alternative identified by Recipient that
resolves such conflict or violation.



2.Term and Termination.

(a)The term and provision of a particular Transition Service shall be as set
forth on Schedule A (unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof).
The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall
continue (unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms hereof) until the
date on which the provision of all Transition Services has terminated or as
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties.



____________________

3 Note to Draft: "Reverse" TSA will reference services performed by the
Transferred Companies to the Retained Businesses. Reverse TSA will include a
provision that services will not be required to be provided to the extent the
Business does not include assets or employees sufficient or necessary to
provide such services. 



(b)Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice
to the other Party on or after the occurrence of any of the following events:



(i)the other Party is in breach of any payment obligation under this Agreement
in any material respect (other than any payment that is being disputed in good
faith) and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written notice
of such breach from the non-defaulting Party; or



(ii)the other Party voluntarily files or involuntarily has filed against it
(which, in the case of an involuntary filing, is not dismissed within ten (10)
Business Days of such filing), any bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency or
reorganization proceeding.



(c)Recipient may from time to time terminate this Agreement with respect to
any particular Transition Service, in whole but not in part, for any reason or
no reason upon providing at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to
Provider of such termination; provided that any cost incurred or continued to
be borne by Provider in connection with such termination that would not have
been incurred or borne by Provider if the applicable Transition Service had
been provided for the entire term set forth on Schedule A (including, but not
limited to continuing license fee payments for software licenses or consents
acquired specifically to provide Transition Services for the term set forth in
Schedule A) shall be borne by Recipient, but only after Provider has taken
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or mitigate such costs. Schedule A
shall be deemed amended to reflect any terminated Transition Service. Such
termination shall be effective as of the first day that is both the first day
of a calendar month and at least thirty (30) days after the date of such
notice (or the first day of such later calendar month as is identified as the
effective termination date in such written notice). In the event of the
termination of a Transition Service that is interdependent with another
Transition Service, Provider will upon receipt of such termination notice
inform Recipient of the nature of such interdependency and identify the
Transition Services that are interdependent on the Transition Service proposed
to be terminated. If Recipient does not rescind such termination and informs
Provider that it nonetheless wishes to terminate a Transition Service, then
the identified interdependent Transition Service shall also be terminated
unless the Parties otherwise agree on an alternative means of providing such
interdependent service and (if appropriate and agreed) revised fees in
connection therewith.



(d)For so long as Provider is providing any Transition Service hereunder and
for one year thereafter, Provider will keep and maintain books and records of
the Transition Services provided and reasonable supporting documentation of
all material costs incurred in connection with providing such Transition
Services, which books and records shall be at least as comprehensive and
detailed as those Provider keeps for itself. Upon termination or expiration of
this Agreement, each Party shall deliver to the other Party all books,
records, files or other documents used by such Party in the performance of the
Services and owned by the other Party as soon as reasonably practicable;
provided that the Party delivering such records may retain a copy of such
records and information for archival purposes in accordance with such Party's
document retention policy and to comply with applicable laws and regulations,
subject to the requirements of Section 11.



(e)In the event of termination or expiration of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall cease to have further force or effect, and neither Party shall have any
liability to the other Party with respect to this Agreement; provided that:



(i)termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not release a Party from
any liability or obligation that already has accrued as of or prior to the
effective date of such termination or expiration, as applicable, and shall not
constitute a waiver or release of, or otherwise be deemed to adversely affect,
any rights, remedies or claims which a Party may have hereunder at Law, in
equity or otherwise or which may arise out of or in connection with such
termination or expiration, subject to the provisions of this Agreement
(including Section 10); and



(ii)Section 2(d) (Records), this Section 2(e) (Survival), Section 10
(Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnification), Section 11
(Confidentiality) and Section 12 (Miscellaneous) shall survive termination or
expiration of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties.



3.Standard of Care. Provider shall provide, or cause to be provided, the
Transition Services with at least the standard of care employed with respect
to performance of comparable services for Provider's own businesses and
Affiliates.



4.Manner of Performance; Utilization Levels; Suspension.



(a)Provider shall provide, or cause to be provided, the Transition Services in
substantially the same manner (which will be of like kind and amount and
provided in the manner and at a relative level of service, for the same
purposes and with the same degree of care, skill and attention, including with
respect to the quality and timeliness of such services, in all material
respects) as any such Transition Services have been provided to the Business4
in the twelve (12) month period prior to the Effective Date (including with
respect to the number of employees dedicated to providing such Transition
Services); provided that Provider may modify the manner in which it provides
the Transition Services to conform to modifications in the manner in which
Provider or its Affiliates generally provide services to their own businesses
or as required by contracts with third parties or contractors, but only if
such modifications would not result in a material impact on the Business or
its operations or the Recipient or the Business generally being treated any
less favorably than Provider or its Affiliates receiving such services. To the
extent Provider may be limited in its ability to provide the Transition
Services due to a limitation in resources, Provider agrees to perform the
Transition Services in this Agreement on a priority equal to a priority in
which it provides services to itself and its Affiliates.



____________________

4 Note to Draft: For the "Reverse TSA", this Section will reference the
Retained Businesses as supported by the Sellers during the 12 months prior to
Effective Date. 



(b)It is the intention of the Parties that Recipient's use of any Transition
Service shall not be materially higher than or expanded from level of
utilization of the Business in the twelve (12) month period prior to the
Effective Date and any ordinary increased utilization consistent with past
growth rates of the Business in the ordinary course. Provider shall have no
obligation to provide Recipient with any levels of Transition Service or
changes to Transition Services beyond that which is expressly agreed to herein
(including the Omitted Services pursuant to Section 1(b)).



(c)Recipient acknowledges that the Transition Services may, from time to time,
in the reasonable discretion of Provider, be interrupted, suspended,
allocated, reduced, temporarily altered or changed in whole or in part for (i)
reasonable and ordinary course or necessary modifications or maintenance
relating to the Transition Services and (ii) any other reasonable matters to
the extent such matters affect Provider and its Affiliates receiving the same
services (the "Service Suspensions"); provided, however, that Provider shall
conduct any Service Suspension for the Transition Services consistent with
past practice of the Business and similarly to treatment of the same or
similar suspensions by Provider with respect to provision of services to its
and its Affiliates' businesses. Provider shall consider the impact of any such
Service Suspension on Recipient, cooperate in good faith with Recipient and
use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any adverse consequences to
Recipient consistent with the manner in which it does so for its and its
Affiliates' businesses and the past practice of the Business. Except in
emergency situations, Provider shall notify Recipient as promptly as
practicable before (or in the case of emergency situations, as promptly as
practicable after) any Service Suspension.



(d)If Provider delegates any of its responsibilities under this Agreement to
any of its Affiliates or (with the prior consent of Recipient (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)) uses subcontractors in the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, then Provider will remain
ultimately and fully responsible to the same extent as if Provider were
performing such obligations itself, including ensuring that the obligations
with respect to the nature, quality and standards of care set forth herein are
satisfied with respect to any services provided by such Affiliate or
subcontractor. Further, if Provider delegates any Transition Service provided
hereunder to a subcontractor, then (except to the extent such Transition
Service has been historically provided to the Business by such subcontractor
prior to the Closing Date) Provider will be responsible for any additional
costs, attributable to the delegation, in excess of the costs that were
charged to Recipient prior to such delegation to a subcontractor for such
Transition Service (such costs, in each case, determined in a manner
consistent with the determination and calculation of such cost for purposes of
the preparation of the Financial Statements).



5.Service Charges.



(a)Fees and Expenses. The fees or basis for calculating the fees for the
Transition Services shall be as set forth in Schedule A. Provider represents
that such fees are based on Provider's costs, determined and calculated on a
basis consistent with the manner in which such costs were calculated and
allocated to the Business for purposes of the preparation of the Financial
Statements, bearing the same relation to actual costs as historically has been
the case for the type of service.



(b)Taxes. Except as expressly noted therein, the amounts set forth on Schedule
A with respect to each Transition Service do not include any sales, use, value
added, goods and services or similar taxes (collectively, and together with
any interest, penalties or additions to tax imposed with respect thereto,
"Sales Taxes"), and Recipient shall promptly reimburse Provider for any such
Sales Taxes (on a grossed up basis) required to be paid or withheld by
Provider (including any such Taxes included in amounts paid by Provider to any
third party provider of Service) in connection with this Agreement or the
performance hereof, which reimbursement shall be in addition to the amounts
required to be paid as set forth on Schedule A and shall be made in accordance
with Section 5(c). Recipient shall pay the full amount of any Transition
Service invoice without deduction or withholding for any taxes, provided that,
in the event any amount is required by Law to be withheld on account of any
taxes, Recipient shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such amount and will
gross-up the amount paid to Provider to equal the amount required to be paid
on the invoice inclusive of taxes. Provider and Recipient shall each use their
reasonable efforts to mitigate any such requirement to withhold any amounts on
account of taxes.



(c)Payment. Provider shall invoice Recipient for the Transition Services on a
monthly basis. Each invoice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
applicable Transition Services provided during such period, the basis for
computing the charges and the corresponding amounts owed. Recipient shall
remit payment for all fees and expenses in connection with the Transition
Services within sixty (60) days after the date of the applicable invoice.



(d)Finance Charge. If Recipient fails to make any payment within fifteen (15)
days of the date such payment was due to Provider, a finance charge of one
percent (1.0%) per month or, if less, the maximum rate allowed by applicable
Law, payable by Recipient to Provider, shall accrue on such unpaid amount from
the date of the applicable invoice to the date such payment is received by
Provider. In addition, Recipient shall indemnify Provider for their costs,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred to collect
any unpaid amount.



6.Cooperation; Information and Access. The Parties will cooperate in good
faith in all matters relating to the provision and receipt of the Transition
Services. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Recipient will
provide Provider (and, as applicable, Provider's Affiliates and third party
providers) in a timely manner, with all information and access to facilities
required or reasonably requested by Provider (and, as applicable, Provider's
Affiliates), in each case to the extent necessary to provide the Transition
Services. If Recipient or its Affiliates is given access, whether on site or
through remote facilities, to Provider's or its Affiliates' computer systems,
electronic data storage systems or software (collectively, the "Systems") in
connection with the Transition Services, they shall comply with the applicable
system security policies, information technology procedures and user terms and
requirements of Provider, any Affiliate or any third party. Recipient and its
Affiliates shall access and use only those Systems for which Provider or its
Affiliates have granted access and use and solely for the purpose of receiving
the Transition Services. In no event shall Provider be required to provide any
information with respect to the Retained Businesses.



7.Third Party Consents. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein,
to the extent that the provision of any Transition Services to Recipient or
its Affiliates under this Agreement requires any third party consents,
licenses, sublicenses or approvals (collectively, "Required 

Consents"), the obligation to provide such Transition Services is contingent
upon receipt of such Required Consents, it being acknowledged and understood
that those third parties are not bound to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any
other provision in this Agreement, Seller will pay any commercially reasonable
amounts required in order to obtain the Required Consents in order to permit
Provider to provide the Transition Services as contemplated hereby, and such
additional costs will not be "passed through" as costs of the Transition
Services except solely to the extent consistent with the costs of such
Transition Services prior to the Closing Date and for purposes of the
preparation of the Financial Statements. To the extent that Provider fails to
obtain any Required Consents, Provider and Recipient will cooperate in good
faith to secure an arrangement, at Seller's cost (to the extent incremental to
the costs of such Transition Service as determined and calculated in
accordance with past practice prior to the Closing Date and for purposes of
the preparation of the Financial Statements), that is reasonably acceptable to
both Parties under which Buyer would obtain the benefit of such Transition
Service. Provider shall also, at Recipient's cost and expense, provide
reasonable assistance necessary to facilitate Recipient's efforts to transfer
(or "split off" as the case may be) to Recipient and/or its Affiliates that
portion of outstanding third party vendor software and system licenses
remaining in Provider's or its Affiliate's name/account and being utilized in
the Business after the Closing.



8.Migration Assistance; Additional Services.



(a)In connection with the separation of the Business from Provider's other
businesses, upon the written request of Recipient, Provider shall transfer or
copy, as the case may be, all data in its possession or under its control
related to the Business in its existing data format or as otherwise agreed to
by the Parties. The transfer or copying of such data, together with reasonable
consultation in connection therewith , shall be Provider's sole obligations
with respect to migration of systems and services to Recipient and/or its
Affiliates and shall be set out in a mutually agreed upon migration plan or as
otherwise reasonably requested by Recipient. Recipient shall reimburse
Provider for the cost of providing such assistance as set forth on Schedule B
or on such other basis as they mutually agree in writing.



(b)If requested in writing by Recipient, Provider shall also use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the services described on Schedule A under the
heading "Additional Services". The obligation to provide such services shall
be subject to the continued employment by Provider or its Affiliates. of the
employees who are capable of providing such services and such commercially
reasonable efforts shall not require Provider or its Affiliates to retain such
employees. The parties acknowledge that such services were not included in the
Financial Statements and shall be recharged at the fully loaded employment
cost (meaning salary, payroll taxes, bonus, vacation pay, fringe benefits) for
the applicable employees according to the actual time spent providing such
Additional Services, without attribution of general and administrative
overhead. Recipient shall reimburse Provider for any out-of-pocket costs
incurred by Provider in connection with the provision of such services
including, in the case of the FPandA Services, an allocated share of the HFM
License equal to $7,000 per month.



9.Intellectual Property. Except with respect to the Intellectual Property
Rights transferred or assigned to Recipient pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement, all firmware and software 

(including any license rights or rights of use) copyright and any and all
other Intellectual Property Rights in all materials, including computer
programs, documentation, reports, modifications thereof, and all other
information shall be owned by the Party that (or whose Affiliate or third
party service provider) developed, wrote, or produced such Intellectual
Property. No license, express or implied, is being granted by the Parties
under this Agreement, other than to the extent necessary for performance of
the applicable Transition Services.



10.Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability; Indemnification.



(a)Disclaimers. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING AS
TO STANDARD OF CARE), THE TRANSITION SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR OTHER WARRANTIES,
CONDITIONS, GUARANTEES OR REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND
RECIPIENT HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY APPLICABLE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR OTHER WARRANTY, CONDITION, GUARANTEE OR
REPRESENTATION, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSITION
SERVICES.



(b)Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM
PROVIDER'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD, IN NO EVENT SHALL
EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOSS OF
ANTICIPATED REVENUES OR PROFITS, FAILURE TO REALIZE EXPECTED SAVINGS, EXPENSES
OF INVESTIGATION, ENFORCEMENT AND COLLECTION AND ATTORNEYS' AND ACCOUNTANTS'
FEES AND EXPENSES) ARISING FROM ANY ACTION RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OF THE SERVICES, WHETHER SUCH ACTION IS BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY) OR OTHERWISE. EXCEPT FOR LOSSES OR
DAMAGES ARISING FROM PROVIDER'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD,
IN NO EVENT SHALL PROVIDER BE LIABLE UNDER THIS SECTION 10 OR OTHERWISE WITH
RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY BREACH HEREOF FOR ANY AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE
AGGREGATE FEES THAT PROVIDER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT
FOR THE SERVICE THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE DISPUTE.

(c)Indemnification.



(i)Recipient agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Provider and its Affiliates
and each of their respective employees, agents, stockholders, members,
partners, officers and directors harmless from and against any losses, costs,
judgments, awards, claims, suits, liabilities, damages and other penalties
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) (collectively, "Losses") arising out of
or resulting from any actions, suits, claims, proceedings or demands brought
by any third party to the extent related to the provision of Transition
Services by Provider or its designees or use 

of the Transition Services by Recipient; provided, however, that the foregoing
indemnity shall not apply to Losses arising out of or resulting from
Provider's gross negligence or willful misconduct.



(ii)Provider agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Recipient and its
Affiliates and each of their respective employees, agents, stockholders,
members, partners, officers and directors harmless from and against any Losses
arising out of or resulting from any actions, suits, claims, proceedings or
demands brought by any third party to the extent arising out of or resulting
from Provider's gross negligence or willful misconduct.



(d) Except for defective performance of a Transition Service arising out of
gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud, Recipient's sole remedy for
defective performance of any Transition Service is correction or compliant re-
performance of such Transition Service.



11.Confidentiality.



(a)The following shall be considered "Confidential Information" for purposes
of this Agreement: all proprietary and confidential information furnished by
any Party, its Affiliates or its Representatives (the "Disclosing Party") to
another Party, its Affiliates or its Representatives (the "Receiving Party")
in connection with the provision of the Transition Services hereunder, whether
or not in writing and whether or not labeled or identified as confidential or
proprietary, including information relating to the Disclosing Party's
business, business relationships and financial affairs, including inventions,
trade secrets, technical information, know-how, product and pricing
information and plans, research and development activities, marketing plans
and activities, customer, supplier and prospect information and employee and
financial information; provided that Confidential Information shall not
include, and there shall be no obligation hereunder with respect to,
information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public, other
than as a result of a disclosure in breach of this Agreement by the Receiving
Party, (ii) the Receiving Party can demonstrate was or became available to the
Receiving Party from a third party not bound by any confidentiality obligation
to the Disclosing Party or (iii) is developed independently by the Receiving
Party without reference to the Confidential Information.



(b)Each Party, in its capacity as the Receiving Party, agrees to (i) treat the
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as confidential; (ii)
safeguard the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party with the same
degree of care used by such Party to protect its own similar Confidential
Information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care; (iii) only
use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for purposes of this
Agreement; (iv) only disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing
Party to its employees, directors, suppliers, agents, subcontractors and
professional advisers who need to know such Confidential Information for
purposes of this Agreement.



(c)Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Sections 11(a)
and 11(b) shall not restrict the Receiving Party from disclosing Confidential
Information to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with the
enforcement of this Agreement or as required by applicable Law or legal or
regulatory process, including any tax audit or litigation. In the event that
the Receiving Party, its Affiliates or its service providers become legally
required by deposition, 

interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand,
formal regulatory request or similar judicial or administrative process to
disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving
Party shall, to the extent permitted by Law, provide the Disclosing Party with
prompt prior written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party
may seek a protective order or other similar remedy to cause such Confidential
Information not to be disclosed. The Receiving Party shall reasonably
cooperate with the Disclosing Party in connection with the Disclosing Party's
seeking of such protective order or similar remedy. In the event that such
protective order or other similar remedy is not obtained or the Disclosing
Party waives compliance with the provisions of this Section 11(c), the
Receiving Party, its Affiliate or its service provider, as the case may be,
shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that has been
legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded such
disclosed Confidential Information.

attempted assignment or conveyance, without the consent of, or other action

amend, change, rescind, expand, exceed or enlarge or reduce or in any way
affect the provisions, including the warranties, covenants, agreements,
conditions, or in general, any rights, remedies or obligations of the China

of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this Bill of Sale,

privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or
default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights
or privileges hereunder.

SUBCONTRACT AGREEMENT



This SUBCONTRACT AGREEMENT ("Subcontract Agreement") is made and entered into
as of the ____ day of _____ __, 201_, by and among BEI Sensors and Systems
Company, Inc. a Delaware corporation ("Prime Contractor"), [SDI NewCo], a
Delaware [corporation] ("Subcontractor") and Custom Sensors and Technologies
Ltd., a private limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales
("US Seller") as financial guarantor of Subcontractor. Capitalized terms used,
but not defined, herein shall have the meaning given to them in the Stock and
Asset Purchase Agreement (as defined below).



RECITALS



A. Prime Contractor has entered into certain Government Contracts with the
United States Government listed on Exhibit A (the "Subject Contracts").



B. US Seller, Crouzet Automatismes S.A.S., a Societe par Actions Simplifiee
organized under the laws of France ("French Seller"), Custom Sensors and
Technologies (Huizhou) Limited, a corporation organized under the laws of
China ("China Asset Seller"; and together with US Seller and French Seller,
"Sellers"), and and Sensata Technologies Holding N.V., a corporation organized
under the laws of the Netherlands ("Buyer") have entered into a Stock and
Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 30, 2015 (the "Stock and Asset
Purchase Agreement") whereby Buyer will purchase Prime Contractor from
Sellers.



C. As a result of the Pre-Closing Restructuring (and, for the avoidance of
doubt, subject to and in accordance to the terms of the Stock and Asset
Purchase Agreement), prior to the Closing Date the assets and certain Excluded
Employees required by the Prime Contractor to perform the Subject Contracts
will be transferred to Subcontractor as part of the Retained US Businesses.



D. Subcontractor and Prime Contractor intend to enter into a customary
Novation Agreement (as defined below) which, upon the approval and acceptance
of the United States Government, will transfer and assign the Subject
Contracts to Subcontractor.



E. Pending acceptance of the aforementioned Novation Agreement by the United
States Government, Subcontractor and Prime Contractor desire to enter into
this Subcontract Agreement whereby Subcontractor will perform the Subject
Contracts, to the same extent as if the Subject Contracts had already been
novated, on a basis as provided in the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement and
this Subcontract Agreement.



AGREEMENT



In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and in the Stock and
Asset Purchase Agreement, Prime Contractor and Subcontractor agree as follows:



ARTICLE I.

PURPOSE OF SUBCONTRACT



Prime Contractor hereby subcontracts to Subcontractor, and Subcontractor
agrees to provide, any and all goods, equipment and services required or
agreed to be provided by Prime Contractor under each Subject Contract,
including any and all amendments, options, modifications, and purchase orders
thereunder executed prior to the Closing Date or on or after the Closing Date
in accordance with Article IV hereof (collectively, the "Subcontractor
Services").



Each of Prime Contractor and Subcontractor acknowledge and agree that the
intent of this Subcontract Agreement is to provide to Subcontractor, to the
fullest extent permissible under each Subject Contract and applicable Law, the
economic and operational benefits and burdens as though the parties shall have
received the necessary consent to assignment or novation of each such Subject
Contracts. In furtherance of the foregoing, Subcontractor acknowledges and
agrees that all Losses incurred by Prime Contractor under this Subcontract
Agreement or any Subject Contract constitute indemnifiable Losses pursuant to
Section 8.2(e) of the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement.



Except for (x) a reorganization or change of corporate form that would not
have a material adverse effect on the ability of Subcontractor to receive the
economic benefits and burdens of the applicable Subject Contract or to novate
any Subject Contract, or (y) any failure resulting from, arising out of or
relating to a breach or inaccuracy of any representation or covenant provided
by Sellers under the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement, Prime Contractor
shall remain a valid and existing corporation duly organized under applicable
Law until the 18 month anniversary of the Closing Date.



ARTICLE II.

TERM



The term of this Subcontract Agreement is from the date of execution of this
Subcontract Agreement until all of the Subject Contracts covered by this
Subcontract Agreement have been (1) duly assigned and/or novated to
Subcontractor, (2) fully performed by Subcontractor, (3) replaced by a
successor contract between Subcontractor and the applicable Governmental
Authority, or (4) terminated in accordance with its terms; provided, however,
that the terms of this Subcontract Agreement will terminate with respect to
any specific Subject Contract covered by this Subcontract Agreement on the
date on which such Subject Contract is (1) duly assigned to Subcontractor,
and/or, if required by the applicable Governmental Authority, novated to
Subcontractor, (2) fully performed by Subcontractor, (3) replaced by a
successor contract between Subcontractor and the applicable Governmental
Authority, or (4) terminates in accordance with its terms (the events
contemplated by this provision, a "Partial Termination"). 



ARTICLE III.

INCORPORATION AND STATEMENTS OF WORK



Any reference to the Subject Contracts in this agreement shall be deemed to
include (but not be limited to) any of the contracts and modifications,
statements of work, delivery orders, supplements, schedules, amendments, and
change orders issued and to be issued by the United States Government, each of
which have become effective prior to the date hereof (or are approved by
Subcontractor under Article IV), listed in Exhibit A and hereby incorporated
by reference herein.



Once made part of this Subcontract Agreement, any reference in such Subject
Contracts to the "Government" or the "Contracting Officer" will mean Prime
Contractor, and any reference to the "Seller" or "Contractor" will mean
Subcontractor, except "Government" and "Contracting Officer" do not change (i)
in the phrase "Government Property," "Government Owned Property," "Government
Equipment," and "Government Owned Equipment;" (ii) when a right, act,
authorization, or obligation can be granted or performed only by the
Government or the Contracting Officer or his duly appointed representative;
(iii) except as otherwise provided in the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement
or this Subcontract Agreement, when access to Prime Contractor's proprietary
financial information or other proprietary data is required by the Government;
(iv) when title to property is to be transferred directly to the Government;
and (v) when rights to Intellectual Property are to be granted to the
Government. With respect to these incorporated clauses, the parties agree that
said clauses are not subject to literal interpretation if such interpretation
is inconsistent with the prime/subcontractor relationship as specified by
provisions that have been included specifically in this Subcontract Agreement
or the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement.



ARTICLE IV.

RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES

PRIOR TO ASSIGNMENT/NOVATION



With respect to any Subject Contracts covered by this Subcontract Agreement
that have not been assigned or novated to Subcontractor prior to the date of
execution of this Subcontract Agreement, until the obligation in respect of
such Subject Contract is terminated in accordance with Article II, Prime
Contractor and Subcontractor will take such actions as are reasonably
necessary to relieve Prime Contractor of any and all liability with respect
to, and provide Subcontractor with, to the fullest extent permissible under
each Subject Contract and applicable Law, the economic and operational
benefits and burdens as though the parties shall have received the necessary
consent to assignment or novation of each such Subject Contract.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for (x) the Prime Contractor's
obligations to cooperate with the novation of the Prime Contracts as provided
hereunder and (ii) routine administration of the Subject Contracts including,
without limitation, (w) the submission of invoices in respect of the Subject
Contracts, (x) the collection of amounts due thereunder, (y) the remittance of
such amounts to the Subcontractor and (z) the submission of certifications,

reasonable advance notice and during reasonable business hours, to review

Consultation and Notification Processes. 

 

a.Prior to acceptance of this Offer by French Seller, French Seller shall, and
shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, comply with all applicable Laws
regarding: (i) the information and/or consultation of the employee
representative bodies/works councils (comites d\'entreprise) (collectively,
"Employee Representative Bodies") and/or any other relevant employee
representative body of the French Seller and BEI France (including, without
limitation, such actions as necessary or desirable to enable the receipt by
the French Seller, BEI France and any other applicable Persons of the opinion
(avis) of the Employee Representative Bodies in connection with the applicable
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement), and (ii) the requirement
to inform the applicable employees of BEI France of the proposed sale of BEI
France/the French Shares in accordance with the provisions of French Law
2014-856 dated 31 July 2014 (Loi sur l'Economie Sociale et Solidaire),
including, without limitation, delivery of notification letters to each of
such employees informing them of their rights thereunder (collectively, the
"Consultation and Notification Processes"). For the purposes hereof,
"Completion" shall mean (x) the delivery to French Seller of executed minutes
of the meetings of the Employee Representative Bodies or such other writing in
a form reasonably acceptable to French Seller evidencing that such Employee
Representative Bodies have delivered a final formal opinion in connection with
the sale of European Company Shares (the "European Company Sale") or are
deemed to have delivered such opinion in accordance with Articles L. 2323-3,
R. 2323-1 and R. 2323-1-1 of French labor code, and (y) the expiration or
termination of all notification, waiting or similar periods, and the
compliance with, and satisfaction of any other conditions or requirements
under, applicable Law related to the information and/or consultation of the
Employee Representative Bodies in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Offer.



b.French Seller agrees to use its reasonable best efforts (i) to have a first
meeting of the Employee Representative Bodies initiate the Consultation and
Notification Processes as soon as is reasonably practicable, but in any event
on or before September 10, 2015, and (ii) to cause the Consultation and
Notification Processes with each of the Employee Representative Bodies and the
applicable employees to be completed as soon as possible after the date
hereof. French Seller further undertakes to keep Buyer regularly informed of
the status of such Consultation and Notification Processes and to promptly
provide Buyer with a copy of duly executed minutes of the meetings of the
relevant Employee Representative Bodies or such other writing evidencing that
such Employee Representative Bodies have delivered or are deemed to have
delivered a final formal opinion in connection with the European Company Sale
(provided that the French Seller may redact any information that is not
related to the sale of the European Company Shares contemplated by this
Offer). French Seller agrees to keep Buyer reasonably apprised of the status
and timing of any meeting with the Employee Representative Bodies and to
provide Buyer 

reasonable advance written notice of any meetings with the Employee
Representative Bodies that Buyer is required or requested (as described in
further detail in the following sentence) to attend. By its execution hereof,
Buyer agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to assist French
Seller in effecting and completing the Consultation and Notification
Processes, including providing such information (subject to applicable
confidentiality obligations and other legal constraints) to, and attending
such meetings with, the applicable Employee Representative Bodies, in each
case as may be required by applicable Law or as may be reasonably requested by
French Seller or such Employee Representative Bodies or their respective
agents or advisors in connection with the Consultation and Notification
Processes. French Seller and Buyer shall each refrain from, and shall cause
its respective Affiliates to refrain from, doing anything that is reasonably
likely to prejudice the expeditious completion of the Consultation and
Notification Processes. French Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, without Buyer's prior written consent, enter into any
agreement or understanding with, or make any commitment to, the relevant
Employee Representative Bodies or any employee that would impose any
obligations on Buyer, its Affiliates or the Company Group (including with
respect to the terms of employment and employment benefits granted to
employees of the European Companies). The parties will consult with each other
and will discuss and consider in good faith any issues and proposals in
relation to the European Company Sale that may be raised by the Employee
Representative Bodies as part of the Consultation and Notification Processes;
provided that (i) without Buyer's prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), French Seller shall not (and
shall cause its Affiliates not to) enter into any material agreement or
understanding with, or make any material commitment to, the Employee
Representative Body as part of the Consultation and Notification Processes
that would bind Buyer or impose any obligations on Buyer, the Companies or any
Transferred Subsidiary (including the European Companies) after the Closing,
and (ii) Buyer shall not be obliged to agree to any modification to this
Offer, the Purchase Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.



2.Exclusivity. French Seller hereby agrees and confirms that it will, and will
cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with the provisions of Section 4.12 (No
Solicitation: Other Bidders) of the Purchase Agreement, which are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall be deemed part of this Offer as
though restated herein, mutatis mutandis; provided that, (i) for the purpose
of this Section 2, the terms "Companies" and "Shares" used in Section 4.12 (No
Solicitation: Other Bidders) of the Purchase Agreement shall be deemed to have
the meanings assigned to such terms following acceptance of the Offer, and
(ii) the term of such provisions shall be deemed to continue to apply to
French Seller in respect of the European Companies until the earlier of (x)
termination of the Purchase Agreement in accordance with its terms, and (y)
the Final End Date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that French
Seller may transfer all or part of the European Company Shares to any
Affiliates in accordance with the Pre-Closing Restructuring, such Affiliates
being then held to transfer the relevant European Company Shares on the terms
and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement in the event of acceptance
of this Offer by the French Seller under the terms set out here above.



3.Publicity. With respect to this Offer and the transactions contemplated
hereby and by the Purchase Agreement, Buyer and French Seller each hereby
agree to comply with the restrictions set forth in Section 4.6 (Public
Announcements) of the Purchase Agreement; provided, however, that without
limiting French Seller's or Buyer's ability to make such disclosures as may be
required by applicable Law or stock exchange rules, in connection with the
Consultation and Notification Processes French Seller may make available to
the applicable Employee Representative Bodies such information as French
Seller determines is reasonably necessary to effect such Consultation and
Notification Processes.



4.Termination; Consideration for the Offer; Fees.



a.This Offer shall terminate and cease to be of any further force or effect
immediately upon expiration of the Offer Period if, prior to such time, French
Seller has not delivered to Buyer an Acceptance Notice. In the event of a
termination of this Offer pursuant to this Section 4(a) prior to termination
of the Purchase Agreement, Sections 2 through 5 shall survive any such
termination.



b.In consideration of the Offer and of the considerable resources Buyer has
expended and is expected to expend in furtherance of the European Company
Sale, French Seller hereby agrees that (i) if, for any reason, it does not
accept the Offer on or prior to the expiration of the Offer Period, and (ii)
the Closing under the Purchase Agreement occurs and the European Company
Shares are not transferred to Buyer in connection therewith, then French
Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid to Buyer, concurrently with the Closing
of the transactions under the Purchase Agreement an amount equal to
$2,150,000, as compensation for the costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and the opportunity cost
incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates.



5.Miscellaneous. The provisions of Article 10 (Miscellaneous) of the Purchase
Agreement are hereby incorporated herein by reference, mutatis mutandis.
