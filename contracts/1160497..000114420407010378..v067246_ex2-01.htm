another  in  structuring and documenting any lawful and reasonable
arrangement under which  the Asset Buyers shall obtain the economic benefits

arrangement may include (i) the subcontracting,  sublicensing or subleasing

order to ensure the  accurate and complete conveyance of the Business to the
Buyers, as long as  the  Sellers notify the Buyers of such changes at least
5 Business Days prior to  the  Closing. In addition, at the sole election of
the Sellers, Blaw-Knox  Construction Equipment Corporation, Blaw-Knox Company
and Blackrod Europe  Limited (or any of them) may instead be transferred to
Buyers through a sale  of  Assets and assignment of Liabilities, as long as
the Sellers have notified  the  Buyers of such decision at least 5 Business
Days prior to the Closing. The  parties agree that the list of Asset Buyers
and Stock Buyers may be amended  by  the Buyers from time to time prior to
the Closing, as long as all Buyers are  wholly-owned Subsidiaries (direct or
indirect) of Buyer Parent, and as long  as  the Buyers notify the Sellers of
such changes at least 5 Business Days prior  to  the Closing.

(g) Wherever  required or appropriate under local laws and practices, the
applicable Buyers  and Sellers shall enter into appropriate local transfer
agreements, governed  by  local laws, for the transfer of the relevant
Assets or Sold Shares. Buyers  and  Sellers shall cooperate in good faith in
the identification of all such local  requirements and the preparation of
such transfer agreements. With respect  to  the Sold Shares in IR Germany,
the Stock Buyers and Ingersoll-Rand Beteiligungs  GmbH as Parent of IR
Germany shall enter into a separate, German language,  Sale  and Purchase
Agreement (German SPA) which shall be notarized before a notary  public.
With  respect to India, it is the intention of the parties, if permitted by
applicable  law and if done in a manner favorable, or at least neutral, for
all parties,  to  sell or transfer the Business as a going concern relatable
to the Business  for a  lump sum purchase price without assigning specific
values to individual assets  or liabilities. Consistent with the terms of
this Agreement, the Sellers and  the  Buyers shall enter into a separate
"Business Transfer Agreement" to meet the  local requirements in India.

coverage that may be provided by the Sellers' third-party insurance  policies
for such Liabilities, and (B) make available to Buyers any proceeds  from
such insurance that may be paid out to Sellers by the relevant insurers.  For
the avoidance of doubt, if any deductible, retention or other self-insured 
amount must be paid before third-party insurance proceeds are available,

by  the  Buyers;

contractual obligations in any  jurisdiction to provide similar insurance,
compensation or benefits for injured  employees;

 

 

(x) all  Liabilities arising out of, based upon, resulting from or relating
to the  Acquired Assets or the Business and based upon, relating to, arising
out of  or  resulting from any fact, circumstance, occurrence, condition,
act or omission  occurring or existing, in whole or in part, after the
Closing;

 

 

(xi) except  as  set forth in Section 2.2(c)(vi), all Liabilities, in
respect of or relating  to  the Business and relating to or arising under
any Environmental Laws or relating  to Hazardous Materials regardless of when
incurred and regardless whether any  event or condition giving rise to any
such Liability occurred or existed as  of,  or prior to the Closing Date;
and

face of the Balance  Sheet of the Business or (y) accrued by any Asset Seller
in respect of the  Business after December 31, 2006 (and prior to the Closing

discharge, the  Excluded Liabilities. As used in this Agreement, the term "

by wire  transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. dollars, free and

required by any U.S.,  state, local or foreign Laws (subject to the
subsequent sentence of this Section  2.3(a)), plus Estimated Cash (the "

and Section 2.6, the " _Purchase  Price_ ").  The  parties agree that, to

Acquired Assets or Sold Shares are being transferred  on  the Closing Date,
the applicable Buyer will pay the applicable Seller the  applicable portion
of the Initial Purchase Price (as allocated pursuant to  _Schedule  2.7_

(iv) At  any  time on or after the date that is the first anniversary of the
Closing Date,  so  long as Buyer Parent's failure to comply with the last
sentence of Section  2.4(b)(i) is not the primary cause of the failure of any
Deferred Item to be  transferred, Buyer Parent may, by delivery of written
notice to IR (each an  " _Abandonment  Notice_ "),  elect  to abandon the
purchase of the remaining Deferred Items.

deliver to the  Sellers the final standard trial balances as of the Closing
Date and related  supplemental schedules for the Acquired Assets, Sold Shares
and Assumed  Liabilities. Within 45 days after all such materials described
in the preceding  sentence have been received by Sellers or made available to
Sellers, the Sellers  will prepare, or cause to be prepared, a statement
containing a calculation  of  the Net Asset Value as of the Closing (the "
_Net  Asset Value Statement_ "),  which  shall be prepared in accordance
with the definition of Net Asset Value. " _Net  Asset Value_ " shall  mean
the book value of the Acquired Assets (excluding any Excluded Assets)  less 
Assumed Liabilities (excluding any Excluded Liabilities) of the Business,
and  the book value of the assets and liabilities of the Sold Companies,
determined  on a combined basis in accordance with Modified GAAP applied on a
basis  consistent with, and reflecting all categories of adjustments on, the
Base  Statement of Net Asset Value. The Buyers will assist and cooperate with
the  Sellers in the preparation of the Net Asset Value Statement, including
by  providing the Sellers and their accountants access to the Books and
Records  of  the Business and to any other information necessary to prepare
the Net Asset  Value Statement.

 

 

(b) The  Buyers shall, within 30 days after the delivery by the Sellers of
the Net Asset  Value Statement, complete their review of the Net Asset Value
Statement. In  the  event that the Buyers determine that the Net Asset Value
Statement has not  been  prepared on a basis consistent with the
requirements of Section 2.6(a), the  Buyers shall, on or before the last day
of such 30-day period, inform the  Sellers in writing (the " _Objection_
"),  setting forth a specific description of the basis of the Objection,
the  adjustments to the Net Asset Value Statement which the Buyers believe
should  be  made, and the Buyers' calculation of the Net Asset Value, and
the Buyers shall  be deemed to have accepted any items not specifically
disputed in the Objection.  Failure to so notify the Sellers shall constitute
acceptance and approval of  the  Sellers' calculation of the Net Asset
Value.

 

 

(c) If  the  Net Asset Value calculated by the Buyer and the Net Asset Value
calculated  by  the Sellers are both less than the Net Asset Value Base
Amount, the Sellers  shall pay an amount in cash equal to the sum of (w) the
amount of the deficiency  between the Net Asset Value Base Amount and the Net
Asset Value calculated  by  the Sellers plus (x) interest computed at the
rate declared from time to time  by  JPMorgan Chase Bank at its "base rate"
(the " _Prime  Rate_ ")  for  the period from the Closing Date to the date
of such payment of the deficiency  amount, in immediately available funds to
the Buyer no later than the third  Business Day following the Sellers'
receipt of the Buyers' Objection. If the Net  Asset Value calculated by the
Buyers and the Net Asset Value calculated by  the  Sellers are both greater
than the Net Asset Value Base Amount, the Buyer shall  pay the Sellers an
amount in cash equal to the sum of (y) the amount of the  excess of the Net
Asset Value calculated by the Buyer over the Net Asset Value  Base Amount
plus (z) interest computed at the Prime Rate for the period from  the 
Closing Date to the date of such payment of the excess amount, in
immediately  available funds to the Sellers no later than the third Business
Day following  the Sellers' receipt of the Buyers' Objection.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(d) The  Sellers shall have 30 days following the date they receive the
Objection to  review and respond to the Objection. The Buyers will provide
the Sellers and  their accountants access to any relevant books and records
of the Business  not  in the possession of Sellers, work papers and to any
other information necessary  to evaluate the Objection. If the Sellers and
the Buyers are unable to resolve  all of their disagreements with respect to
the determination of the foregoing  items by the 30th  day  following the
Sellers' response thereto, after having used their good faith  efforts to
reach a resolution, they shall refer their remaining differences  to 
Deloitte and Touche or another internationally recognized firm of independent 
public accountants as to which the Sellers and the Buyers mutually agree
(the  " _CPA  Firm_ "),  who  shall, acting as experts in accounting and
not as arbitrators, determine on  a  basis consistent with the requirements
of Section 2.6(a), and only with respect  to the specific remaining
accounting related differences so submitted, whether  and to what extent the
Net Asset Value Statement requires adjustment. The  Sellers and the Buyers
shall request the CPA Firm to use its best efforts to  render its
determination within 45 days. The CPA Firm's determination shall be 
conclusive and binding upon the Sellers and the Buyers. The Sellers and the 
Buyers shall make reasonably available to the CPA Firm and each other all 
relevant books and records, any work papers (including those of the
parties' respective accountants) and supporting documentation relating to the
Net Asset  Value Statement and all other items reasonably requested by the
CPA Firm. The  " _Final  Statement of Net Asset Value_ " shall  be (i) the
Net Asset Value Statement in the event that (x) no Objection is  delivered to
the Sellers during the initial 30-day period specified above or  (y)  the
Sellers and the Buyers so agree, (ii) the Net Asset Value Statement, 
adjusted in accordance with the Objection, in the event that (x) Sellers do 
not  respond to the Objection during the 30-day period specified above
following  receipt by the Sellers of the Objection or (y) the Sellers and the
Buyers so  agree or (iii) the Net Asset Value Statement, as adjusted pursuant
to the  agreement of the Buyers and the Sellers or as adjusted by the CPA
Firm together  with any other modifications to the Net Asset Value Statement
agreed upon by  Sellers and the Buyers. All fees and disbursements of the CPA
Firm shall be  borne equally by the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Buyers,
on the other  hand.

 

 

(e) If  the  calculation of the Net Asset Value contained in the Final
Statement of Net  Asset  Value is less than the Net Asset Value Base Amount,
the Sellers shall pay an  amount in cash equal to the difference of (x) the
amount of such deficiency  minus (y) any amounts paid by the Sellers to the
Buyers pursuant to clause  (w)  of Section 2.6(c) (not including any
interest provided for in clause (x) of  Section 2.6(c)) (such difference, the
" _Remaining  Net Asset Value Deficiency_ "),  plus  (z) interest computed
at the Prime Rate for the period from the Closing Date  to  the date of such
payment on the Remaining Net Asset Value Deficiency, in  immediately
available funds to the Buyers within three (3) Business Days after  the
ultimate determination of the Final Statement of Net Asset Value as provided 
in this Section 2.6. If the calculation of the Net Asset Value contained in 
the  Final Statement of Net Asset Value is greater than the Net Asset Value
Base  Amount, the Buyers shall pay an amount in cash equal to the difference
of (1)  the amount of such excess minus (2) any amounts paid by the Buyers in
cash  to  the Sellers pursuant to clause (y) of Section 2.6(c) (not
including any interest  provided for in clause (z) of Section 2.6(c)) (such
difference, the " _Remaining  Net Asset Value Excess_ "),  plus  (3)
interest computed at the Prime Rate for the period from the Closing Date 
to  the date of such payment on the Remaining Net Asset Value Excess, in
immediately  available funds to the Sellers, within three (3) Business Days
after the  ultimate determination of the Final Statement of Net Asset Value
as provided  in  this Section 2.6.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(f) The  Base  Statement of Net Asset Value has been prepared in good faith
by the Sellers  for  the purpose of correctly listing, to the Knowledge of
the Sellers, all Acquired  Assets (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
Excluded Assets and excluding  Cash that is included in the adjustment
provided for in Section 2.3(b)) and  Assumed Liabilities (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, Excluded Liabilities  and excluding Indebtedness of the
Sold Companies that is included in the  adjustment provided for in Section
2.3(b)) as of the date of the Base Statement  of Net Asset Value. For the
avoidance of doubt, the parties intend that the  Base  Statement of Net
Asset Value and the Final Statement of Net Asset Value shall  not include any
Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities. The Base Statement  of  Net Asset
Value and the Final Statement of Net Asset Value shall be consistently 
prepared. In the event that the parties determine, in good faith, that the 
Base  Statement of Net Asset Value should have taken into account any Asset
or  Liability of the Business which mistakenly was not so included, then the
Base  Statement of Net Asset Value shall be adjusted accordingly and the
Final  Statement of Net Asset Value shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with the  revised Base Statement of Net Asset Value. In the event that the
Base Statement  of Net Asset Value takes into account any Asset or Liability
which the parties  later determine, in good faith, should not have been so
included, then the  Base  Statement of Net Asset Value shall be adjusted
accordingly and the Final  Statement of Net Asset Value shall be prepared on
a basis consistent with the  revised Base Statement of Net Asset Value. In
the event that the parties are  unable to agree upon adjustments in
accordance with this Section 2.6(f) after  discussion for 30 days, the
disagreement shall be resolved by the CPA Firm  who  shall, acting as
experts in accounting and not as arbitrators, determine on  a  basis
consistent with the requirements of this Section 2.6(f), and only with 
respect to the specific disagreements so submitted, the proper adjustments. 

 

 

SECTION  2.7. _Purchase  Price Allocation._

 

 

(a) The  Purchase Price (including Assumed Liabilities that are treated as
assumed for  Tax purposes) shall be allocated among (i) the Acquired Assets
sold by the  Asset  Sellers and (ii) the Sold Shares, in a manner that will
be mutually agreed  by  the parties, in good faith, as soon as practicable
following the execution  of  this Agreement. In the event an adjustment to
the Purchase Price is made  pursuant to Section 2.3(b) or 2.6 or otherwise
under this Agreement, the  allocation of the Purchase Price (including
Assumed Liabilities that are treated  as assumed for Tax purposes) shall be
revised to allocate such adjustment to  the  Acquired Assets or Sold Shares,
as the case may be, based upon the item to  which  such adjustment is
attributable.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(b) The  Sellers shall prepare an allocation among the Acquired Assets sold
by the Asset  Sellers in the United States (in accordance with the allocation
that is agreed  under Section 2.7(a) and Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations  promulgated thereunder) and submit it to the Buyers for
their approval within  60  days of the final purchase price adjustment. If
within 30 days of such  submission the Buyers and the Sellers are unable to
agree upon the allocation  after negotiating in good faith, the parties will
each prepare their own  allocation in a manner consistent with Section 1060
of the Code and the Treasury  Regulations promulgated thereunder.

 

 

(c) Except  as  otherwise provided by the immediately preceding paragraph or
as required by  applicable Law, the Sellers and the Buyers shall report the
Tax consequences  of  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
manner consistent with  the  allocation that is agreed under Section 2.7(a)
and the Purchase Price allocation  described therein, as it may be revised
from time to time, and shall not take  any position inconsistent therewith in
preparing any Tax Returns, (including  IRS  Form 8594 and any other Tax
forms or filings), as well as in preparing any  published financial
statements in accordance with Modified GAAP, and none of  the  Buyers or the
Sellers shall take any position inconsistent therewith upon  examination of
any Tax Return, in any Tax refund claim, or in any Tax litigation  or
investigation, in each case involving a material amount of Taxes, without

SECTION  3.1. _Organization. _

 

 

Each  of  the Sellers and Sold Companies is a corporation or other business
entity duly  incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the  Laws  of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. Each
of the Sellers and  Sold Companies has all requisite corporate or other power
and authority to  own  its Assets and to carry on its business as now being
conducted and is duly  qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in the  jurisdictions in which the ownership of its property or the
conduct of its  business requires such qualification or license, except where
the failure to  be  so qualified or licensed would not reasonably be
expected, individually or  in  the aggregate, to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

SECTION  3.2. _Authorization,  Enforceability._

 

 

Each  of  the Sellers has the corporate or other power and authority to
execute and  deliver this Agreement and each Closing Agreement to which it is
a party and  to  perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. Except as
described on  _Schedule  3.7_ ,  the  execution and delivery by each
Seller of this Agreement and each Closing  Agreement to which it is a party,
and the performance by such Seller of its  obligations hereunder and
thereunder, have been duly authorized by all necessary  corporate or other
action on the part of such Seller. This Agreement has been  duly executed and
delivered by each of the Sellers and each Seller shall duly  execute and
deliver each Closing Agreement to which it is a party and, assuming  due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Buyers, this Agreement 
constitutes, and each Closing Agreement shall constitute, a valid and
binding  agreement of each of the Sellers party thereto, enforceable against
each of  them  in accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of
bankruptcy, insolvency,  fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium
and other similar Laws  relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally
and general equitable  principles (whether considered in a proceeding in
equity or at  law).

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

SECTION  3.3. _Capital  Stock of the Sold Companies._

 

 

Set  forth  on _Schedule  3.3_   is the  jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization and the number of authorized,  issued and outstanding shares of
each of the Sold Companies and, except as  set  forth on _Schedule  3.3_
,  there  are no other authorized, issued or outstanding shares of capital
stock of the  Sold Companies. Except as set forth on _Schedule  3.3_ ,  all
of  the issued and outstanding Sold Shares are owned of record, free and
clear  of  any and all Encumbrances, by the Stock Seller identified on
_Schedule  3.3_   as  owning such Sold Shares. All of such issued and
outstanding Sold Shares and  shares of the other Sold Companies have been
validly issued, are fully paid  and  nonassessable and have not been issued
in violation of any preemptive or similar  rights. Except as set forth on
_Schedule  3.3_ ,  there  are no outstanding options, warrants, calls,
rights or any other agreements  relating to the sale, issuance or voting of
any shares of the capital stock  of  the Sold Companies, or any securities
or other instruments convertible into,  exchangeable for or evidencing the
right to purchase any shares of capital  stock  of the Sold Companies.
Except for any intercompany arrangements that may exist  with IR or its
Affiliates, which are disclosed on _Schedule  3.11_   or  _Schedule 
3.15(a)_ ,  none of  which shall transfer to the Buyers or remain binding
upon any Sold Company  after  the Closing, and except for the Dominator
Agreement and the ABG Agreement,  no  Sold Company and no Stock Seller of
any Sold Shares of any Sold Company is  party  to any agreement that grants
any Person (other than a Sold Company) any rights  in respect of (i)
corporate governance or profits of any Sold Company and or  (ii) voting
rights of any Sold Shares.

 

 

SECTION  3.4. _Subsidiaries_.  No Sold  Companies have any Subsidiaries or

income statement of the Business for the year  ended December 31, 2006
(together with the Balance Sheet, the " _Financial  Statements_ ")  are 
attached hereto as _Schedule  3.5_.  The  Financial Statements have been
prepared from the Books and Records of the  Business and in accordance with
Modified GAAP applied on a consistent basis.  The  unaudited combined income
statement included in the Financial Statements  presents fairly in all
material respects the combined results of operations  of  the Business for
the period covered, and the Balance Sheet presents fairly  in  all material
respects the combined financial condition of the Business as of  its  date,

(b) Section  3.5(a) is qualified by the fact that the Acquired Assets and
Sold Companies  comprising the Business have not operated as separate "stand
alone" entities  within IR. As a result, the Business, the Acquired Assets
and the Sold Companies  have been allocated certain charges and credits for
purposes of the preparation  of the Financial Statements. Such allocations of
charges and credits do not  necessarily reflect the amounts that would have
resulted from arms-length  transactions or the actual costs that would be
incurred if the Business operated  as an independent enterprise.

 

 

SECTION  3.6. _Absence  of Undisclosed Liabilities._   There  are no
Liabilities of any kind whatsoever, and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers,

prepared  in  accordance with Modified GAAP, other than Liabilities (i)
reflected on, or  reserved for in, the Balance Sheet, (ii) arising after
December 31, 2006, in  the  ordinary course of business and consistent with
past practices, (iii) disclosed  on _Schedule  3.6_   and  _Schedule

_Schedule  3.7_ ,  the  execution, delivery and performance by the Sellers
of this Agreement and the  Closing Agreements and the consummation by the

not (i) violate, conflict with  or result in a breach by any of the Sellers
or the Sold Companies of the  organizational documents of any of the Sellers
or the Sold Companies, (ii)  violate, conflict with or result in a breach of,
or constitute a default by  any  of the Sellers or the Sold Companies (or

Sold Companies or any of their respective properties  may be bound, (iii)
violate or result in a breach of any Order or Law applicable  to any of the
Sellers or the Sold Companies or any of their respective  properties, (iv)
except for applicable requirements of the HSR Act and Other  Competition Laws
and as may be required solely by reason of the Buyers' (as  opposed to any
other third parties') participation in the transactions  contemplated hereby,
require any Consent of any Governmental Authority and  (v)  require any
Consent of any other Person, except, in each of the foregoing cases,  as
would not individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have 
a  Company Material Adverse Effect or a material and adverse effect on the
ability  of any of the Sellers to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement.

Company Material Adverse Effect. The Asset Sellers  and the Sold Companies
have all material licenses, permits, franchises,  registrations and other
governmental authorizations necessary to conduct the  Business as presently
conducted as a going concern ("Permits"). This Section 3.8  (a) does not
relate to matters with respect to (i) Taxes, which are the subject  of

the HSR Act, (ii) as promptly as practicable make all filings under 
applicable Other Competition Laws, if any, required for the transactions 
contemplated hereby, and (iii) as promptly as practicable make all required 
filings for governmental approval of this Agreement and the transactions 
contemplated hereby under applicable Laws of the People's Republic of China, 
India and any other country where a governmental approval is determined to 
be  necessary. Any such antitrust notification and report form or filing
and  supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance with the 
requirements of the HSR Act or the applicable Other Competition Laws, as the 
case may be. All other regulatory filings shall be in substantial compliance 
with the requirements of applicable Laws. Each of the Buyers and Sellers
shall  furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as  the  other may request in connection with its preparation of
any filing or submission  that is necessary under the HSR Act, applicable
Other Competition Laws or other  applicable Laws and regulations, as the case
may be. The Sellers and Buyers  shall use all commercially reasonable efforts
to comply promptly with any  inquiries or requests for additional information
from the FTC, the DOJ, other  Governmental Antitrust Authorities and any
other Governmental Authority having  jurisdiction. Each of the Sellers and
the Buyers shall use all commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain any
clearance required under the HSR Act, Other  Competition Laws or other
applicable Laws and regulations for the consummation  of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Subject  to any appropriate confidentiality and joint-defense privilege
protections,  the  Sellers and the Buyers shall each furnish to the other
such necessary  information and reasonable assistance as the other party may
request in  connection with the foregoing and shall each promptly provide
counsel for the  other party with copies of all filings made by such party,
all correspondence  between such party (and its advisors) with any
Governmental Antitrust Authority  or other Governmental Authority and any
other information supplied by such  party  and such party's Affiliates to a
Governmental Antitrust Authority or other  Governmental Authority in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party shall, subject to applicable Law,  permit counsel for
the other party to review in advance any proposed written  and, if
practicable, oral, communication to any Governmental Antitrust Authority  or
other Governmental Authority.

 

 

(d) The  filing fees under the HSR Act, Other Competition Laws and other
applicable  Laws,  as well as the fees and disbursements of any legal
counsel or other advisor  jointly retained by the parties in connection with
any such filings and any  other filings with Governmental Authorities, shall
be borne by the  Buyers.

 

 

SECTION  5.4. _Third  Party Consents_ _._   The  Sellers shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Consent  (" _Third  Party
Consents_ ")  of any  Person (other than Governmental Authorities) required
to consummate and make  effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Buyers agree  to  cooperate reasonably with the Sellers in
obtaining such Consents. To the extent  that the Sellers and the Buyers are
unable to obtain any required third party  Consents prior to the Closing
(such Consents, the " _Post-Closing  Consents_ "),  each  of the Sellers
and the Buyers, respectively, shall use all commercially  reasonable efforts
to make or obtain (or cause to be made or obtained) as  promptly as
practicable all Post-Closing Consents. For purposes of this Section  5.4, the
term "all commercially reasonable efforts" shall not be deemed to  require
any Person to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any  obligation in
favor of) any Person from whom any consent or waiver may be  required (other
than nominal filing or application fees).

 

 

SECTION  5.5. _Tax  Matters_ _._

 

 

(a) The  Buyers and the Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other,  upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance  relating directly to the Sold Companies or the Acquired Assets
(including access  to books and records, employees, contractors and
representatives) as is  reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns, the making of any  election related to Taxes, the preparation for
any audit by any Taxing  Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any
claim, suit or proceeding  relating to any Tax Return; provided, however,
that if such requested  information is contained within a document containing
any unrelated information,  only portions pertaining to such relevant
information shall be furnished (unless  the furnishing of the entire document
is required by the relevant Taxing  Authority). The Buyers and the Sellers
shall retain all books and records with  respect to Taxes pertaining to the
Sold Companies and the Acquired Assets until  the expiration of all relevant
statutes of limitations (and, to the extent  notified by the Buyers and the
Sellers, as the case may be, any extensions  thereof). At the end of such
period, each party shall provide the other with  at  least 30 days, prior
written notice before destroying any such books and  records, during which
period the party receiving such notice can elect to take  possession, at its
own expense, of such books and records.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(b) The  Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax Returns in
respect  of  the Sold Companies or the Acquired Assets for any taxable
period ending on  or  before the Closing Date in a manner consistent with
past practices. Except  as  provided in the following sentence, the Sellers
shall provide the Buyers with  a  copy of a substantially final draft of
each income Tax Return and other material  Tax Returns at least 14 Business
Days prior to the filing of such Tax Return.  Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, (i) in the case of any  request to extend the time for
filing such Tax Return with the relevant Taxing  Authority, such Tax Return
shall only be provided to the Buyers within 5  Business Days prior to filing
such request and (ii) German VAT returns shall  be  provided to the Buyers
as soon as practicable following completion of such  returns. The Sellers
shall timely file, or cause to be filed, all such Tax  Returns. The Sellers
shall timely pay to the relevant Taxing Authority all  Taxes  due in
connection with any such Tax Returns. In advance of the filing of such  Tax
Returns, the Buyers and the Sold Companies shall pay to the Sellers, the 
Buyers' and the Sold Companies' share of such Taxes, determined in
accordance  with Section 5.6, to the extent reflected on the Final Statement
of Net Asset  Value, provided that the Buyers shall not be obligated to make
such payment  in  advance, but only promptly, if the Sellers failed to
deliver copies for review  by the Buyers within the applicable time periods
specified above. The Buyers  shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, all
other Tax Returns in respect of  the  Sold Companies, including for any
taxable year ending after the Closing Date  which begins before the Closing
Date (a " _Straddle  Period_ "),  in a  manner consistent with past
practices and on the basis that the relevant taxable  period ended as of the
close of business on the Closing Date (unless the  relevant Taxing Authority
will not accept a Tax Return filed on that basis).  The  Buyers shall
provide IR with a copy of a substantially final draft of each  Straddle
Period Tax Return (and such additional information regarding such  Straddle
Period Tax Return as may reasonably be requested by IR) for its review  and
comment (i) at least 14 Business Days prior to the filing of such Tax Return 
or (ii) in the case of a Tax Return that is required to be filed within 20 
days  of the Closing Date, at least 10 days prior to the date such Tax Return
is  required to be filed; _provided_ ,  that in  the case of a Tax Return
that is required to be filed within 10 days of the  Closing Date, the Buyers
shall use their reasonable best efforts to afford  the  Sellers a reasonable
opportunity to review such Straddle Period Tax Return  prior  to filing such
Tax Return. The Buyers shall pay the amount shown to be due  on  any such
Tax Returns. In advance of the filing of such Tax Returns, the Sellers  shall
pay to the Buyers their share of any such Taxes, determined in accordance 
with Section 5.6, provided that the Sellers shall not be obligated to make 
such  payment in advance, but only promptly, if the Buyers failed to deliver
copies  for review by the Sellers within the applicable time period specified
above.  The  Buyers shall timely prepare and file all other Tax Returns in
respect of the  Sold Companies for any taxable period that begins after the
Closing Date, and  the Buyers shall timely pay to the relevant Taxing
Authority all Taxes due  in  connection with any such Tax Returns. Buyers
acknowledge that from and after  the  Closing Date the Sellers may not have
the power and authority to endorse certain  of the refund checks to which
they may be entitled and that may be received  by  the Sellers with respect
to Taxes paid by the Sellers for the Tax periods prior  to the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) _Tax  Elections_.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(i) The  Buyers shall not make any Tax election or undertake any
restructuring actions  under the Code (or the Tax Laws of any other
jurisdiction) with respect to  the  Sold Companies which would cause such
stock sale to be treated as an asset  sale  for Tax purposes, including, any
check-the-box elections or election pursuant  to  Section 338 of the Code
(or any comparable state, local or foreign provision).  However, prior to
Closing, the Sellers will continue to evaluate whether to  permit Buyers to
make a Section 338(h)(10) election with respect to Blaw Knox  Construction
Equipment Corporation, it being understood that, among other  considerations,
the Sellers willingness to permit such an election will depend  upon the
Buyers' ability and willingness to ensure that such election has no  adverse
effects (including financial effects) on Sellers or any of their  affiliates.
In addition, Buyers shall not, except as required by Law, amend  any  Tax
Return filed with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof in  the 
case of a Straddle Period) ending on or before the Closing Date, consent to 
the  waiver or extension of the statute of limitations relating to Taxes of
the  Sold  Companies or the Acquired Assets, or compromise or settle any Tax
Liability,  in  each case if such action could have the effect of increasing
the Tax liability  or reducing any Tax asset of the Sellers in respect of any
taxable period (or  portion thereof in the case of a Straddle Period) ending
on or before the  Closing Date, in each case without the Sellers' written
consent, such consent  not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

(d) Prior  to  the Closing Date, the parties to any tax-sharing agreement
(excluding fiscal  consolidations under German Law which shall be governed by
Section 5.22 herein)  between any of the Sold Companies on the one hand and
the Sellers and any of  their Affiliates on the other hand shall settle any
Liabilities under such  agreement and shall subsequently terminate such
agreement, and no party thereto  shall have any Liability thereunder
following the Closing Date.

 

 

SECTION  5.6. _Tax  Indemnity_ _._

 

 

(a) Subject  to the monetary limitations on the Sellers' indemnity
obligations as set forth  in Section 9.1, the Sellers shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify the Buyers  and their Affiliates (including the Sold
Companies) and each of their respective  officers, directors, employees and
agents and hold them harmless against (i)  all  Tax liabilities of the
Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Sold  Companies) for any period
(but specifically excluding Taxes, if any, imposed  on  the Sellers and
arising out of the Buyers' operation of the Business following  the Closing
Date), (ii) all Tax liabilities of the Sold Companies or their  Affiliates or
with respect to the Acquired Assets for all taxable periods (or  portions
thereof in the case of a Straddle Period) ending on or before the  Closing
Date except to the extent of the amounts reflected on the Final  Statement of
Net Asset Value, (iii) all Taxes that are Excluded Liabilities  described in
Section 2.2(c)(iv) hereof, (iv) all Tax liabilities arising out  of  or due
to any breach of any covenant or other agreement of the Sellers contained  in
this Agreement, (v) all Tax liabilities arising out of or due to any breach 
of representations made in Sections 3.11, and (vi) all Liabilities, costs, 
expenses (including reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees
and  expenses), losses, damages, assessments, settlements or judgments
arising out  of  or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of
any Tax described  in  clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above. The Tax
indemnity provided under  this Section 5.6(a) shall cover any Tax liability
of IR Germany or the Buyer  resulting from the Sellers' non-compliance with
its obligations related to the  delivery of a Transfer Pricing Report
pursuant to Section 5.22. The Tax  indemnity provided under this Section
5.6(a) shall not cover Tax liabilities  resulting from any transaction of the
Sold Companies outside of the ordinary  course of business and not
contemplated by this Agreement that occurs on the  Closing Date but after the
Closing (and not as a consequence of Closing or  any  Sold Company ceasing
to be associated with any of the Sellers for Tax purposes). 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(b) Subject  to the provisions set forth in this Agreement, the Buyers,
jointly and  severally, and the Sold Companies shall indemnify the Sellers
and their  Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees and  agents and hold them harmless against (i) all Tax liabilities
of the Sold  Companies or with respect to the Acquired Assets (A) resulting
from any  transaction of the Sold Companies outside of the ordinary course of
business  and  not contemplated by this Agreement occurring on the Closing
Date but after  the  Closing, (B) with respect to any taxable period (or
portions thereof in the  case  of a Straddle Period) that begins after the
Closing Date and that are imposed  on  or in respect of the Sold Companies
or the Acquired Assets, (ii) all Taxes  that  are Assumed Liabilities
described in Section 2.2(b)(vii), (iii) all Tax  Liabilities arising out of
or due to any breach of any covenant or other  agreement of the Buyers
contained in this Agreement and (iv) all Liabilities,  costs, expenses
(including reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees and
expenses), losses, damages, assessments, settlements or judgments  arising
out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any  Tax 
described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above.

 

 

(c) For  purposes of this Section 5.6, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on  a  periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the
portion of such Tax  related to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on
and including the  Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than
gross receipts,  sales  or use taxes and Taxes based upon or related to
income, be deemed to be the  amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction,  the  numerator of which is the number of days in
the taxable period ending on and  including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days  in  the entire taxable period,
and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related  to income and gross
receipts, sales or use taxes, be deemed equal to the amount  which would be
payable if the relevant taxable period ended on and included  the  Closing
Date. The portion of any credits relating to a Straddle Period shall  be 
determined as though the relevant taxable period ended on and included the 
Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing 
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with the past practice of 
the  Sold Companies.

 

 

(d) Payment  by the indemnitor of any amount due under this Section 5.6 shall
be made within  ten Business Days following written notice by the indemnitee
that payment of  such amounts to the appropriate Taxing Authority is due,
provided that the  indemnitor shall not be required to make any payment
earlier than 5 Business  Days before it is due to the appropriate Taxing
Authority. In the case of any  written notice by any of the Buyers or their
Affiliates indicating that Taxes  are due for a Straddle Period Tax Return,
such notice shall set forth in  reasonable detail the calculations regarding
the Sellers' share of such Taxes,  and if within 10 Business Days after
receipt of such notice, the Sellers notify  the Buyers in writing that they
disagree with the computation of their share  of  such Taxes, the Sellers
and the Buyers shall proceed in good faith to determine  the Sellers' share
of such Taxes. If the Sellers and Buyers cannot agree in good  faith on such
share within thirty (30) days after the Sellers' receipt of such  notice, the
Sellers' share of such Taxes shall be determined pursuant to Section  5.6(f),
and the Sellers' payment to the Buyers shall be due three (3) Business  Days
after the amount payable by the Sellers is determined by agreement between 
the Sellers and the Buyers or pursuant to Section 5.6(f), subject to the
proviso  in the first sentence of this Section 5.6(d). In the case of a Tax
that is  contested in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.7 below,
payment of  the  Tax to the appropriate Taxing Authority shall not be
considered to be due  earlier than the date a final determination to such
effect is made by the  appropriate Taxing Authority or court.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the
representations and  warranties set forth in Section 3.11 shall survive until
5:00 p.m. (New York  City time) on the third (3rd)  anniversary of the
Closing Date and (ii) the obligations of a party to indemnify  and hold
harmless another party pursuant to this Section 5.6, other than, for  the
avoidance of doubt, pursuant to Section 5.6(a)(v), shall terminate at the 
close of business on the 30th  day  following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect  to the Tax liabilities in
question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation  or  extension thereof);
_provided, _ that,  in  each case, such representations, warranties and
obligations shall survive beyond  such period with respect to any breach
thereof or any claim of indemnity  hereunder if written notice thereof shall
have been duly given within such  period in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 5.6.

 

 

SECTION  5.7. _Procedures  Relating to Indemnity of Tax Claims_ _._

 

 

(a) The  Sellers shall promptly notify the Buyers in writing upon receipt of
notice  of  any pending Tax audits or assessments relating to the Acquired
Assets or to  income, properties or operations of the Sold Companies. If a
claim shall be  made  against the Buyers or the Sellers, as the case may be,
or any of their  Affiliates by any Taxing Authority, which, if successful,
would result in an  indemnity payment to the Buyers or the Sellers, as the
case may be, or one  of  their Affiliates pursuant to Section 5.6(a) or (b)
(a " _Tax  Claim_ "),  the  Buyers or the Sellers, as the case may be,
shall promptly notify the Sellers  or  the Buyers, as the case may be, in
writing of such Tax Claim stating the nature  and basis of such Tax Claim and
the amount thereof, to the extent known by  the  Buyers or the Sellers, as
the case may be. If notice of a Tax Claim is not  given  to the Sellers or
the Buyers, as the case may be, within a sufficient period  of  time to
allow the Sellers or the Buyers, as the case may be, to effectively  contest
such Tax Claim, or in reasonable detail to apprise the Sellers or the 
Buyers, as the case may be, of the nature of the Tax Claim, in each case
taking  into account the facts and circumstances with respect to such Tax
Claim, the  Sellers or the Buyers, as the case may be, shall not be liable to
the Buyers  or  the Sellers, as the case may be, or any of their Affiliates
to the extent that  the Sellers' or the Buyers', as the case may be, ability
to effectively contest  such Tax Claim is materially prejudiced as a result
thereof.

 

 

(b) With  respect to any Tax Claim that relates to a taxable period ending on
or before  the Closing Date or to which Section 5.7(c)(i) applies, the
Sellers shall  control at their expense all proceedings taken in connection
with such Tax  Claim  (including selection of counsel) and, without limiting
the foregoing, may in  their sole discretion pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals,  proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
Taxing Authority with respect  thereto and may, in their sole discretion,
either pay the Tax claimed and sue  for a refund where applicable Law permits
such refund suits or contest the  Tax  Claim in any permissible manner. With
respect to any Tax matter covered by  the  preceding sentence, the Sellers
shall keep the Buyers reasonably informed and  shall afford the Buyers the
opportunity to participate (at Buyer's sole cost and  expense), as may be
reasonably requested by the Buyers, in any such audit or  proceeding to the
extent that an adverse determination in any such audit or  proceeding would
result in a material Tax liability or a material reduction  of  any Tax
Asset of a Buyer, the Sold Companies or any of their Affiliates, and  no 
such audit or proceeding may be settled or resolved without the written
consent  of the Buyers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The  Buyers' consent shall be deemed given in the absence of the
Sellers' receipt of  the Buyers' response within 7 Business Days of the
consent having been requested  in writing by the Sellers.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(c) Buyers  shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Claim that
relates to  a  Straddle Period, provided that if the matter (i) relates to
Taxes for which  the  Sellers could be subject to Liability under Section
5.6 and which Liability  is  greater than the amount of Taxes Buyers would
be responsible for in respect  of  such Straddle Period, then Sellers shall
have the right to control such matters  as specified in Section 5.7(b), or
(ii) relates to Taxes for which the Sellers  could be subject to Liability
under Section 5.6 but which is not covered by  clause (i) herein, the Buyers
shall not, without the prior written consent  of  the Sellers (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), agree  or  consent to
compromise or settle, either administratively or after the  commencement of
litigation, any issue or claim arising in such proceeding,  or  otherwise
agree or consent to any Tax liability. The Sellers' consent shall be  deemed
given in the absence of the Buyers' receipt of the Sellers' response  within
7 Business Days of the consent having been requested in writing by the 
Buyers.

 

 

(d) The  parties agree to act in good faith with respect to the prosecution
and defense  of any audit, Tax Claim or other proceeding arising hereunder,
including without  limitation, timely responding to any notices or reasonable
requests received  from the other party.

 

 

SECTION  5.8. _Refunds  and Tax Benefits_ _._   Any Tax  refunds that are
received by the Buyers, or the Sold Companies, and any amounts  credited
against Tax (including any offsetting adjustments in connection with  any
audits, examinations or Tax proceedings) to which the Buyers or the Sold 
Companies become entitled, that relate to Excluded Assets or Excluded 
Liabilities or to taxable periods (or portions thereof in the case of a
Straddle  Period) ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the
account of the  Sellers, except to the extent that amounts in respect of the
right to such  refund are reflected (either as an Asset or in reducing a
Liability) in the  Final Statement of Net Asset Value, and the Buyers shall
pay over to the Sellers  the net amount (after taking into account any costs
or expenses of the Buyers  or  the Sold Companies relating to the receipt
thereof) of any such refund or any  such credit within 15 days after the
receipt or entitlement thereto. The Buyers  agree that they shall not,
without the Sellers' consent (such consent not to be  unreasonably withheld),
cause or permit the Sold Companies to carryback to  any  taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date any net operating loss,  loss from
operations or other Tax attribute, and further agree that the Sellers  have
no obligation under this Agreement to return or remit any refund or other 
Tax benefit attributable to a breach by the Buyers of the foregoing
undertaking.  Any Tax refunds that are received by the Sellers and any
amounts credited  against Tax to which the Sellers become entitled, that
relate to taxable periods  (or portions thereof in the case of a Straddle
Period) ending after the Closing  Date (except to the extent that amounts in
respect of the right to such refund  were paid by the Sellers) shall be for
the account of the Buyers, and the  Sellers shall pay over to the Buyers the
net amount (after taking into account  any costs or expenses of the Sellers
relating to the receipt thereof) of any  such refund or any such credit
within 15 days after receipt or entitlement  thereto.

SECTION  5.9. _Employees;  Benefit Plans_ _._

 

 

(a) _Employees  and Offers of Employment._

 

 

(i) The  Sellers and Buyers agree to cooperate reasonably during the period
prior to  the  Closing Date to ensure the continuity of the workforce of the
Business. In  furtherance thereof, prior to, or in connection with, the
Closing, the Buyers  shall take no action to cause the Sellers or the Sold
Companies to terminate  the  employment of any Business Employee, and the
Sellers and the Sold Companies  shall be under no obligation to terminate any
Business Employee prior to, or  on  the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing
Date, one or more of the Buyers shall  offer employment to each Business
Employee (other than an employee of the Sold  Companies, all of whom shall
continue employment with such Sold Company as  of  the Closing Date by
operation of Law) who is either actively employed by a  Seller as of the
Closing Date or is absent from work as of the Closing Date  by  reason of
any leave of absence (including, without limitation, vacation, injury,  sick
leave, long-term disability, short-term disability, maternity leave, 
military service or other leave of absence from which an employee's return
to  active employment is protected by Law or Order). _Schedule  5.9(a)(i)_
  sets  forth each Business Employee who is on an authorized leave of 
absence.

 

 

(ii) Such  offers of employment described in Section 5.9(a)(i) shall include
an offer  of  base salary (or wages), commission rates (if applicable) and
target  annual  cash  bonus  opportunity (exclusive of any stay bonuses,
success bonuses and similar  arrangements of IR, any Seller or Sold Company
or any Affiliate of  any of  them in  connection with the transactions
contemplated herein and any equity,  phantom  equity  or other  equity 
-based  compensation plan, including the Performance Share Plan) that, in
the  aggregate (subject to applicable laws, works council and collective
bargaining  agreements),  are not  less than as in effect with respect to
such Business Employee immediately prior  to the Closing Date, and otherwise
shall be consistent with this Section 5.9  and, except for Business Employees
whose principal work location is the subject  of an eminent domain proceeding
commenced by the People's Republic of China,  shall not require any Business
Employee to relocate to a work location more  than  20 miles from such
Business Employee's work location during the one year period  following the
Closing. As of the Closing Date or, with respect to any Business  Employee on
an authorized leave of absence, as of the date such Business  Employee
commences active employment with the Buyers or returns to active  employment
with a Sold Company, each Business Employee who accepts Buyers' offer  of
employment and each employee of the Sold Companies (herein collectively 
referred to as " _Transferred  Employees_ ")  shall  become an employee of
one or more of the Buyers (or the Sold Companies, as  applicable). During the
one year period from and after the Closing, the Buyers  shall provide to the
Transferred Employees overall employee benefits (exclusive  of any stay
bonuses, success bonuses and similar arrangements of IR, any Seller  or Sold
Company or any Affiliate of any of them in connection with the  transactions
contemplated herein  and  any  equity,  phantom  equity  or other
equity-based compensation arrangements, including the Performance  Share 
Plan) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided on 
average to Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date. 
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
alter  the at-will nature of any Transferred Employee's employment. Nothing
in this  Agreement shall restrict, limit or interfere with the ability (after
the Closing  ) of the Sellers, Buyers or their respective Affiliates to
terminate, amend  or  replace any particular agreement, plan or program
(including, without  limitation, salaries (or wages), commission rates and
bonus opportunities),  to  alter the terms and conditions of employment or
terminate the employment of  any  person, provided that the requirements of
this Section 5.9 are otherwise  satisfied.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(b) _Prior  Service; Deductibles_.  The  Buyers shall, or shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, recognize each  Transferred Employee's service with
the Sellers, the Sold Companies, or any of  their respective Affiliates or
their respective predecessors as of the Closing  Date as service with the
Buyers, the Sold Companies or any of their respective  Affiliates, as
applicable, for all purposes (including, without limitation,  eligibility,
vesting, eligibility waiting periods, benefit accruals) to the  extent that
such service was credited for such purpose under a comparable plan  of the
Sellers, the Sold Companies or any of their respective Affiliates in  the 
Buyers', the Sold Companies' or any of their respective Affiliates' employee 
benefit plans, agreements, policies or other arrangements (unless  such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period).  In 
addition, to the extent pre-existing condition limitations have been met or 
are  otherwise inapplicable with respect to Transferred Employees under
Sellers' employee welfare benefits plans as of the Closing Date, the Buyers
shall, or  shall cause their respective Affiliates to, waive any such pre-
existing  condition limitations under Buyers' employee welfare benefit plans
applicable to  Transferred Employees or their respective spouses or
dependents and shall  recognize (or cause to be recognized) the dollar amount
of all expenses incurred  by Transferred Employees and their respective
spouses or dependents during  the  calendar year in which the Closing occurs
for purposes of satisfying the  deductibles and co-payment or out-of-pocket
limitations for such calendar year  under the relevant employee welfare
benefit plans of the Buyers, the Sold  Companies and their respective
Affiliates, as applicable, to the extent taken  into account for such purpose
under a comparable plan of the Sellers, the Sold  Companies or any of their
Affiliates. Sellers  shall be solely responsible for the administration of,
and all costs and  Liabilities arising in connection with, medical (including
dental, vision,  mental health and prescription drug) benefits claims by
Transferred Employees  (other than Business Employees of the Sold Companies)
and their spouses,  dependents or other beneficiaries incurred on or prior to
the Closing Date,  without regard to whether such claims are submitted prior
to, on or after the  Closing Date.

 

 

(c) _Accrued  Vacation/Repatriation/Relocation._

 

 

(i) The  Buyers shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to, credit
each  Transferred Employee with the accrued and unused vacation days and any
personal  and sickness days accrued in accordance with the vacation and
personnel policies  and labor agreements of the Sellers, the Sold Companies,
the Asset Sellers,  the  Stock Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates
in effect as of the  Closing.

 

 

(ii)   Effective as of the Closing  and  continuing until December 31,
2007,  the  Buyers expressly agree to honor, and to cause their Affiliates
and the Sold  Companies to honor, with  respect to the Transferred Employees

50  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(d) _Severance  Obligations_.

 

 

(i) The  Sellers shall be responsible for any and all liabilities associated
with each  Business Employee who declines Buyers' offer of employment,
excluding any  employee of the Sold Companies or any employee otherwise
transferred to the  Buyers by operation of Law (which employees shall be the
sole obligation of  the  Buyers) (the " _Non-Transferring  Employees_ ").

 

 

(ii) Effective  as of the Closing and continuing until the first anniversary
of the Closing,  the  Buyers shall, or shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, provide Transferred  Employees severance benefits that are no
less favorable than the severance  benefits provided under the terms of the
Seller's plans identified on  _Schedule  5.9(d)(ii)_   as in  effect
immediately prior to the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the 
Sellers shall reimburse the Buyers for the amount (the " _Excess  Amount_
")  equal  to the excess of (I) the severance benefits to be paid or
provided to any  Transferred Employee pursuant to this Section 5.9(d)(ii) in
connection with  his  or her termination of employment by Buyers over (II)
the severance benefits,  if  any, that would otherwise be paid or provided
to such individual under the  terms  of Buyers' applicable severance plan
(calculated without regard to the  requirements of this Section 5.9(d)(ii)).
The Buyers shall provide the Sellers  with one or more invoices for the
Excess Amount as and when such amounts become  due, together with such
supporting documentation as the Sellers shall reasonably  request. The
Sellers shall pay each such invoice within ten (10) Business Days  after
receipt of such invoice and supporting documentation (or, in the event  of 
a good faith dispute over the amount of the invoice, within ten (10)
Business  Days after such dispute is resolved). For the avoidance of doubt,
if there  is no  obligation under Buyers' applicable severance plans in
connection with any such  Transferred Employee's termination of employment,
including where such  Transferred Employee does not execute any release
required as a condition under  the applicable plan of Buyers, the amount
determined under clause (II) above  shall be zero.

 

 

(e) _Annual  Incentive Matrix Bonus; Performance Share Plan Award; and
Success  Bonus_. 

 

 

(i) No  later  than 90 days after the Closing, Sellers shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared,  a statement (the " _AIM  Calculations Statement_ ") 
containing Sellers' determination of (A) the amount (the " _AIM  Program
Payment Amount_ ")  equal  to the pro rata portion as of 11:59 P.M. local
time on the Closing Date of  the  annual bonuses payable to Transferred
Employees pursuant to the Annual Incentive  Matrix Bonus Program for the
calendar year 2007 as in effect on the date hereof  (the " _AIM  Program_
"),  determined in accordance with the terms of the AIM Program and based
upon  financial performance and/or results determined by Sellers and
employee  performance determined by the Sellers and (B) the federal, state,
local and  foreign payroll and other similar Taxes other than Social Security
Taxes payable  by the Buyers as a result of the payment to Transferred
Employees of bonuses  under the AIM Program in the amount of AIM Program
Payment Amount (the " _Payroll  Tax Amount_ ").  Upon  final determination
of the AIM Program Payment Amount and the Payroll Tax Amount  pursuant to
this Section 5.9(e)(i), but in no event more than three (3) business  days
thereafter, Sellers shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available 
funds to an account or accounts which are designated by Buyers not more than 
two  (2) business days following Sellers' notice to Buyers of such final 
determination, cash in an amount equal to: (a) the AIM Program Payment
Amount  plus (b) the Payroll Tax Amount. The amount of the AIM Program
Payment Amount  wired by the Sellers to the Buyers shall be used exclusively
for the purpose  of  providing payment to each Transferred Employee of his
or her allocated amount  under the AIM Program. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Final Statement of Net  Asset Value shall not include any provision or
accrual for any AIM bonus amount.

or implied, shall  be  treated as an amendment or other modification of any
Company Group Plan or  any  employee benefit plan, program or arrangement

Plan_ ")  or  shall limit the right of the Buyers and the Sold Companies or
any of their  Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise
modify any Buyer  Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement following  the Closing Date. In the event that (i) a party other
than the parties hereto  makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any
provision in this Agreement  as an amendment to any such Company Group Plan
or Buyer Benefit Plan, and (ii)  such provision is deemed to be an amendment

defined in the  WARN Act, affecting in whole or in part any site of
employment,  facility  or  operating unit with respect to the Business, and

pursuant to the WARN Act based  on,  arising out of, resulting from or
relating to any act or omission to act by  or  of the breaching party.

Section 5.11 shall  prohibit Buyers from contacting the customers, suppliers

for the purpose of selling  products of the Buyers' businesses or for any
other purpose unrelated to the  Business and the transactions contemplated by

         |  

(C)

The  foregoing notwithstanding, it shall not constitute a violation of
_Section  5.12(a)(iv)_   for the  Buyers or their Affiliates to make a non-
targeted placement search or to place  a  general solicitation for
employment or other services in a newspaper, other  periodical or on the
internet or for any of the Buyers or their Affiliates  to  hire a former
employee of the IR company stores retained by the Sellers pursuant  to such
non-targeted placement search, general solicitation or pursuant to  a 
preexisting contractual arrangement.

 

 

(b) The  parties mutually agree that this Section 5.12 is reasonable and
necessary to  protect and preserve Buyers' and Sellers' legitimate business
interests and the  value of the Business, the Acquired Assets, the Sold
Shares and the Sellers' other businesses, and to prevent any unfair advantage
conferred on any party  and  their respective successors.

 

 

(c) The  parties hereto recognize that the Laws and public policies of the
various  jurisdictions around the world may differ as to the validity and
enforceability  of covenants similar to those set forth in this Section 5.12.
It is the  intention of the parties that the provisions of this Section 5.12
be enforced  to  the fullest extent permissible under the Laws and policies
of each jurisdiction  in which enforcement may be sought, and that the
unenforceability (or the  modification to conform to such Laws or policies)
of any provisions of this  Section 5.12 shall not render unenforceable, or
impair, the remainder of the  provisions of this Section 5.12.

 

 

(d) If  a  final judgment of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction
determines  that  any term or provision contained in this Section 5.12 is
invalid or  unenforceable, then the parties agree that the court or tribunal
will have  the  power (but without affecting the right of Sellers or Buyers
to obtain the relief  provided for in this Section 5.12 in any jurisdiction
other than such court's or  tribunal's jurisdiction) to reduce the scope,
duration or geographic area of the  term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases or to replace any invalid  or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and  enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid  or  unenforceable
term or provision. To the extent it may effectively do so under  applicable
Law, each of the Buyers and the Sellers hereby waives on its own  behalf and
on behalf of its successors, any provision of Law which renders  any 
provision of this Section 5.12 invalid, void or unenforceable in any 
respect.

 

 

(e) Each  of  the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the remedy of
indemnity payments  pursuant to Article IX and other the remedies at law for
any breach of the  requirements of this Section 5.12 would be inadequate, and
agrees and consents  that, without intending to limit any additional remedies
that may be available,  temporary and permanent injunctive and other
equitable relief may be granted  without proof of actual damage or inadequacy
of legal remedy in any proceeding  which may be brought to enforce any of the
provisions of this Section  5.12.

(f) In  addition to the foregoing, the Sellers agree that they shall not, and
shall  cause their Affiliates not to, discourage any of the persons listed
on  _Schedule  5.12(f)_   ("Key  Employees") from accepting Buyers' offers
of employment following the Closing.  Sellers shall make the Key Employees
available to Buyers, to an extent that  does  not interfere unreasonably
with the management of the Business, for the purpose  of facilitating
discussions between the Buyers and the Key  Employees. __

 

 

SECTION  5.13. _Use  of  Names_ _._

 

 

(a) The  parties agree that at the Closing appropriate affiliates of the
Sellers and  Buyers shall enter into a license agreement, for a period of 12

Agreement"). The Buyers acknowledge and  agree that the Buyers and their
respective Affiliates, except as will be  expressly set forth in the IR
License Agreement, do not and shall not by virtue  of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, obtain any  right, title or
interest in, to or under the "Ingersoll-Rand" brand name or "IR" logotype,
all of which are, and will remain, the sole property of Sellers and  their
Affiliates.

 

 

(b) Each  of  the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at
law for any breach  of the requirements of this Section 5.13 would be
inadequate, and agrees and  consents that, without intending to limit any
additional remedies that may  be  available, temporary and permanent
injunctive and other equitable relief may  be  granted without proof of
actual damage or inadequacy of legal remedy, and  without posting any bond or
other undertaking, in any proceeding which may  be  brought to enforce any
of the provisions of this Section 5.13.

 

 

SECTION  5.14. _Credit  and Performance Support Obligations_ _._

unconditionally  relieved on or prior to the Closing Date of all Liabilities
arising out of  the  letters of credit, performance bonds and other similar
items issued and  outstanding, as described on _Schedule  5.14(a)_ ,  and
the  Buyers shall indemnify IR and its Affiliates against any Losses of any
kind  whatsoever with respect to such Liabilities. The Buyers agree to
continue to  use  all commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing Date
to relieve IR and  its  Affiliates of all such Liabilities.

 

 

(b) The  Sellers agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Buyers  and  the Sold Companies to be absolutely and unconditionally

outstanding, as described  on _Schedule  5.14(b)_ ,  and the  Sellers
shall indemnify the Buyers and the Sold Companies against any and all  Losses
of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Liabilities. The Sellers  agree
to continue to use all commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing

other papers, as may be required to consummate  the transactions contemplated

assignment of the Acquired Assets to the Buyers and the retention of the 
Excluded Assets by Sellers as specified in Section 2.1, and (ii) such
assumption  agreements (including assumption agreements in relation to
specific Acquired  Contracts (including such assumption agreements expressly

Affiliates from any Liability with respect  to  the Assumed Liabilities or
to obtain releases of the Buyers and their Affiliates  from any Liability
with respect to the Excluded Liabilities.

 

 

(b) To  the  extent that, from time to time after the Closing, Sellers and
their respective  Affiliates and/or the Buyers and the Sold Companies shall
identify Assets that  are included in the Acquired Assets but that are in the
possession of the  Sellers or their respective Affiliates, the Sellers shall
use all commercially  reasonable efforts to locate such items of Acquired
Assets and, to the extent  that it is successful in locating such items, take
such action as is necessary  to put the Buyers or one of their Affiliates in
actual possession and control  thereof (it being understood and agreed that
delivery thereof to the nearest  facility of any Buyer or its Affiliates
shall in any event suffice), all of  the  foregoing at the Buyers'
reasonable expense. To the extent that, from time to  time after the Closing,

Companies), the Buyers shall use all commercially  reasonable efforts to
locate such items of Excluded Assets and, to the extent  that they are
successful in locating such items, take such action as is  necessary to put

suffice), all of the foregoing at Sellers' reasonable  expense.

 

 

SECTION  5.16. _Intercompany  Debt_ _._   To the  extent reasonably
practicable and permissible under applicable Laws, to the  extent that there
are receivables or payables between the Sold Companies, on  the  one hand,
and the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand (the  "
_Intercompany  Payables and Receivables_ "),  all  such payables shall be
paid and satisfied by the party that is the obligor  on or  prior to the
Closing Date. To the extent any Intercompany Payables and  Receivables are
not so paid and settled, such Intercompany Payables and  Receivables shall be

SECTION  5.17. _Shared  Sales and Service Agreements_ _._   The  Buyers
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to release the Sellers from 
Liabilities that Sellers may incur under the Shared Sales and Service 
Agreements, but only to the extent that such Liabilities relate to or arise

by  Buyers, or (B) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting  the foregoing, the Buyers shall make a bona fide written offer to
the applicable  counterparty to each such Shared Sales and Service Agreement to
enter into a  new dealer or distributor Contract relating to the distribution
of products  of  the Business, on commercially reasonable terms. The Sellers
agree to cooperate  reasonably in all such efforts. The Sellers or their
Affiliates, as applicable,  shall take action after the Buyers' written offer
is made with respect to such  Shared Sales and Service Agreement to remove the
products of the Business from  the scope of the Shared Sales and Service
Agreement in accordance with Buyers' reasonable direction. The Buyers will
reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless  the  Sellers and their Affiliates
against any Losses incurred by any IR Indemnified  Persons that relate to the
Business and that result from any claim by the  counterparty to any Shared
Sales and Service Agreement to the extent such  claim arises out of the sale of
the Business to the Buyers or any termination  or  deemed termination of any
Shared Sales and Service Agreement arising out of  the sale of the Business to
the Buyers or the separation of Business products  from the Shared Sales and
Service Agreements as described above. The Sellers  will reimburse, indemnify
and hold harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates against  any Losses incurred
by any Buyer Indemnified Persons that result from any claim  by the
counterparty to any Shared Sales and Service Agreement to the extent  such

Agreements.

avoidance of doubt, Transfer Taxes shall not include any withholding  Taxes
that are withheld in accordance with Section 2.3(a) (except to the extent 
such withheld Taxes are, in fact, Transfer Taxes), or any other Taxes
measured  by reference to the income or gain of the Sellers or any one of the
Sellers.  Each party shall use reasonable efforts to avail itself of any
available  exemptions from any such Taxes or fees, and to cooperate with the
other parties  in providing any information and documentation that may be
necessary to obtain  such exemptions.

Buyer and the Sold  Companies in respect of any Liability, claim, damage or

such jurisdictions which is reasonably likely to result in any  such  Law or
Order (for the avoidance of doubt, a trial, hearing or other court 
proceeding in which no Governmental Authority is a plaintiff or claimant
shall  not be deemed to be "commenced by any Governmental Authority").

(a) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this
Agreement may be terminated  and  the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement abandoned at any time prior  to  the Closing:

 

 

(i) by  mutual  written consent of IR and Buyer Parent;

 

 

(ii) by  IR if  any of the conditions set forth in Article VI shall have

(iii) by  Buyer  Parent if any of the conditions set forth in Article VII

permitted  under  Section 2.4(b)) does not occur on or prior to August 31,
2007 (the " _Termination  Date_ ");  _provided_   that a  party may not
terminate pursuant to this clause if the failure of such  consummation shall

INDEMNIFICATION

 

 

SECTION  9.1. _Indemnification  by the Sellers_ _._

 

 

(a) Subject  to the limits set forth in this Article IX, from and after the
Closing, the  Sellers agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless  each Buyer and each of their Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the  Sold  Companies) and their respective officers, directors,
stockholders, employees,  agents and representatives (the " _Buyer 
Indemnified Persons_ ")  against and in respect of any and all actions,
suits, proceedings, claims,  Liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses
(including reasonable fees  and  expenses of counsel) (collectively, "
_Losses_ "),  that  they may incur or suffer and that arise out of, result
from or are due to (i)  any breach of any representation or warranty of the
Sellers contained in this  Agreement (other than the Tax representations and
warranties contained in  Section 3.11, which are addressed separately in the
Tax indemnity set forth  in  Section 5.6, and other than the representations
and warranties contained in  Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, 3.14 (as it relates
to title), 3.18 (as it relates  to  title), and 3.19 (as it relates to
title) (such parts of Article III being  referred to collectively as, the "
_Title  Representations_ ")),  in  any Closing Agreement or in any
certificates delivered in connection herewith  or  therewith, (ii) any
breach of any Title Representations, (iii) any failure  of  Sellers to
perform any covenant or other agreement of the Sellers contained  in  this
Agreement or any Closing Agreement and (iv) any Excluded Asset or Excluded 
Liability.

 

 

(b) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, in respect of
all Losses  and  claims under clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 9.1(a) and in
respect of all Losses  and claims under Sections 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 hereof
(other than as set forth  in Section 9.1(f) below), none of the Buyer
Indemnified Persons shall be  entitled to recover from the Sellers any Losses
until the total of all Losses,  regardless of amount, collectively exceed
$15,000,000, and then only for the  amount by which such Losses collectively
exceed $15,000,000; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that  any Loss and claim
under  Sections 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 or 5.8 hereof that  is  less than the
$100,000 threshold provided in Section 9.1(e) below shall not  be  counted
toward the calculation of Losses under this Section 9.1(b).

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

70  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(c) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, in respect of
all Losses  and  claims under clause (i) of Section 9.1(a) and  in 
respect of all Losses and claims under Sections 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 hereof 
(other than as set forth in Section 9.1(f) below),  the  Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to recover more, in the  aggregate, than 30% of
the Purchase Price (as finally adjusted) from the Sellers  with respect to
all such Losses.

 

 

(d) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, in respect of
all Losses  and  claims under Title Representations, such claims shall first
be applied to the  30% cap described in Section 9.1(c) above, as with all
other claims. Once such  30% cap has been exhausted, if there are remaining
claims under Title  Representations, then the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to recover  additional amounts not to exceed, when aggregated
with recoveries under the  30%  cap described above, a total recovery of
100% of the Purchase Price (as finally  adjusted) from the Sellers.

 

 

(e) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, Buyer
Indemnified Parties  shall not be entitled to recover any amount for any
individual Loss and claim  under Sections 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 or 5.8 hereof (other
than as set forth in Section  9.1(f) below) that is less than $100,000.

 

 

(f) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties  shall be entitled to recover from the Sellers an amount
equal to any and all  Tax  Liabilities suffered by IR Germany in relation to
the ABG Agreement, and any  and  all Losses and claims in respect of clauses
5.6(a)(i), (iii) and (iv), in each  case without regard to any of the
financial limits described above.

 

 

No  indemnification claim under this Agreement may be asserted or pursued
against  the Sellers by any entity that is a Sold Company as of the Closing
Date if  such  entity shall cease to be controlled by the Buyers or their
Affiliates, except  with respect to indemnification claims with respect to
(i) the Title  Representations, (ii) Sections 5.5, 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8 hereof
and (iii) the  Excluded Assets and/or the Excluded Liabilities.

 

 

SECTION  9.2. _Indemnification  by the Buyers_ _._

 

 

(a) From  and  after the Closing, the Buyers agree, jointly and severally,
to indemnify, defend  and hold each Seller and each of their Affiliates and
their respective officers,  directors, stockholders, employees, agents and
representatives (the " _IR  Indemnified Persons_ ")  harmless from and in
respect of any and all Losses that they may incur arising  out of or due to
(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Buyers  contained in
this Agreement, (ii) any failure of Buyers to perform any covenant  or other
agreement of the Buyers contained in this Agreement and (iii) any  Acquired
Asset or Assumed Liability.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

71  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(b) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, in respect of
clause (i)  of  Section 9.2(a), the following thresholds and limits shall
apply:

 

 

(i) none  of  the IR Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to recover from
the Buyers any  Losses, until such Losses, regardless of amount, collectively
exceed  $15,000,000, and then only for the amount by which such Losses
collectively  exceed $15,000,000; and

 

 

(ii) the  IR  Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover more, in
the aggregate,  than 30% of the Purchase Price (as finally adjusted) from the
Buyers with  respect to all such Losses.

 

 

(c) Anything  to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, the Buyers
shall, to the  extent that IR Germany should incur losses in its 2007
accounts per German  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (the "IR
Germany Losses") and receive  compensation for the IR Germany Losses from IR
Bet pursuant to the Dominator  Agreement or ABG Agreement, indemnify IR Bet
in an amount equal to the received  compensation.

 

 

SECTION  9.3. _Indemnification  as Exclusive Remedy_ _._   Except  as
otherwise expressly provided in Article V, and except for claims or actions 
for fraud, the indemnification provided in this Article IX, subject to the 
limitations set forth herein, shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy 
available to any party in connection with any Losses arising out of or
resulting  from this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The
foregoing  notwithstanding, nothing in this Section 9.3 shall limit or
restrict the ability  or right of any party hereto to seek injunctive or
other equitable relief for  any breach or alleged breach of any provision of
Articles II, V or X of this  Agreement; _provided_   that any  procedures
in respect of and limitations on Losses or Liabilities in this  Article IX
shall in no event be diminished or circumvented by such  relief.

 

 

SECTION  9.4. _Indemnification  Calculations_ _._

 

 

(a) The  amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under
this Agreement  shall be computed net of any insurance proceeds (or other
third-party  indemnification proceeds) received by the indemnified party in
connection with  such Losses. If an indemnified party receives insurance
proceeds (or other  third-party indemnification) in connection with Losses
for which it has received  indemnification, such party shall refund to the
Indemnifying Party the amount  of  such insurance proceeds promptly after
receipt thereof, up to the amount of  indemnification received. An
indemnified party shall use its commercially  reasonable efforts to pursue
insurance claims with respect to any Losses. The  Buyers shall surrender (and
otherwise become subrogated) to the Sellers rights  to the recovery on, and
the conduct of any Tax Claims against the Sellers' third-party indemnitors,
but only if and when the Buyer has actually received  full compensation from
the Sellers in respect of the matter that is the subject  of such claims. If
the amount with respect to which any claim is made under  this  Agreement
(an " _Indemnity  Claim_ ")  gives  rise to a currently realizable Tax
Benefit (as defined below) to the party  making the claim, the indemnity
payment shall be reduced by the amount of such  Tax Benefit available to the
party making the claim. To the extent that such  Indemnity Claim does not
give rise to a currently realizable Tax Benefit, if  the  amount with
respect to which such Indemnity Claim is made is reasonably expected  to give
rise to a material, subsequently realized Tax Benefit to the other  party 
that made the claim, the indemnity payment shall be reduced by the
reasonably  estimated present value of such Tax Benefit. For purposes of this
Section  9.4(a), a " _Tax  Benefit_ " to  a  party means an amount by
which the tax liability of such party (or group of  Affiliates including such
party) is reduced as a result of its receipt of  payment for such Indemnity
Claim or its payment of the Liability giving rise  to  such Indemnity Claim,
such amount to be determined at an assumed marginal rate  equal to the
highest marginal tax rate then in effect for corporate taxpayers  in  the
relevant jurisdiction. Where a party has other losses, deductions, credits 
or items available to it, the Tax Benefit from any losses, deductions,
credits  or items relating to the Indemnity Claim shall be deemed to be
realized after  any other losses, deductions, credits or items. The parties
agree that any  indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated as  an  adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise
required by applicable  Law.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

72  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(b) Indemnifiable  Losses shall in no event include any special, indirect,
incidental, punitive  or  consequential damages whatsoever, except (i) in
the event of fraud, gross  negligence or willful misconduct and (ii) in the
event that a third party has  been awarded special, indirect, incidental,
punitive or consequential  damages.

 

 

SECTION  9.5. _Survival_ _._   The  representations and warranties of the
parties contained in this Agreement or  in  any instrument delivered
pursuant hereto will survive the Closing and will  remain in full force and
effect thereafter until 5:00 p.m. (New York City time)  on the day that is
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date; _provided_   that (i)  the
survival of the representations and warranties contained in _Section  3.11_
  shall be  governed by _Section  5.6(e)_ ,  (ii)  the Title
Representations shall expire at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on  the 
tenth (10th)  anniversary of the Closing Date, and (iii) the representations
and warranties  shall survive beyond the respective periods set forth in this
Section 9.5 with  respect to any breach thereof if written notice thereof
shall have been duly  given within such period in accordance with Section 9.6
hereof.

 

 

SECTION  9.6. _Notice  and Opportunity to Defend_ _._   If there  occurs
an event which a party asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to  Section
9.1 or 9.2, the party or parties seeking indemnification shall notify  the
other party or parties obligated to provide indemnification (the "
_Indemnifying  Party_ ")  promptly. If such event involves any claim or the
commencement of any action  or  proceeding by a third person, the party
seeking indemnification will give such  Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice of such claim or the commencement  of  such action or proceeding.
However, the failure to provide prompt notice as  provided herein will
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder  only if, and to
the extent that, such failure actually and materially prejudices  the
Indemnifying Party hereunder. In case any such action shall be brought 
against any party seeking indemnification and it shall notify the
Indemnifying  Party of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled  to  assume the defense thereof, with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party  and,  after notice from the Indemnifying Party to such
party or parties seeking  indemnification of such election so to assume the
defense thereof, the  Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the party or
parties seeking  indemnification hereunder for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other  expenses subsequently incurred by such party or parties
in connection with  the  defense thereof. The Indemnifying Party and the
party seeking indemnification  agree to cooperate fully with each other and
their respective counsel in  connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any such action or  asserted Liability. The party or parties
seeking indemnification shall have  the  right to participate at their own
expense in the defense of such action or  asserted Liability. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of an action,  no settlement or
compromise thereof may be effected (i) by the Indemnifying  Party without the
written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall  not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless all relief provided is paid  or 
satisfied in full by the Indemnifying Party or (ii) by the indemnified party 
without the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed). In no event shall an Indemnifying Party 
be  liable for any settlement effected without its written consent.

SECTION  9.7. _Tax  Indemnity_ _._   Other  than as specifically set forth
in Sections 9.1, 9.2, 9.4 and 9.8,  indemnification with respect to Taxes
shall be governed by Section 5.5, Section  5.6, Section 5.7 and Section 5.8.

 

 

SECTION  9.8. _Other  Limitations on Indemnification_ _._   Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Buyer  Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to indemnification under Article V or  IX  for any
Losses to the extent that such Losses are reflected as a Liability  of  the
Business on the Final Statement of Net Asset Value.

 

 

SECTION  9.9. _No  Right of Contribution_ _._   After  the Closing, the
Sold Companies shall have no Liability to indemnify either  the  Sellers or
any of their Affiliates on account of the breach of any  representation or
warranty or the nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement  of  the Sellers
or their Affiliates; and Sellers shall have no right of contribution  against
the Sold Companies. In addition to any other remedy which may be  available
at law or in equity, the Buyer or the Sold Companies shall be entitled  to
specific performance and injunctive relief to enforce this Section 9.9, 
without being required to post a bond or give other security.

 

 

ARTICLE  X

 

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

 

SECTION  10.1. _Governing  Law_ _._   This  Agreement shall be construed
under and governed by the Laws of the State of  New  York.

 

 

SECTION  10.2. _Projections_ _._   In  connection with the Buyers'
investigation of the Sold Companies and the  Business, the Buyers may have
received, or may receive, from the Sellers and/or  their respective
representatives certain projections and other forecasts for  the  Business,
and certain business plan and budget information. The Buyers  acknowledge
that (i) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make  such 
projections, forecasts, plans and budgets, (ii) the Buyers are familiar with 
such uncertainties, (iii) the Buyers are taking full responsibility for
making  their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections,  forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to them, and (iv) the
Buyers will  not  assert any claim against the Sellers or any of their
respective directors,  officers, employees, Affiliates or representatives, or
hold the Sellers or  any  such Persons liable, with respect to such
projections, forecasts, business  plans  and budget information.
Accordingly, the Buyers acknowledge that the Sellers  make no representation
or warranty with respect to such projections, forecasts,  business plans or
budget information and that the Sellers make only those  representations and
warranties explicitly set forth in Article III.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

74  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

SECTION  10.3. _Materiality;  Schedules_ _._

 

 

(a) As  used  in this Agreement, unless the context would require otherwise,
the terms "material" and the concept of the "material" nature of an effect
upon the Sold  Companies or the Business shall be measured relative to the
entire Business,  taken as a whole, as such business is currently being
conducted.

 

 

(b) There  have been included in the Schedules and may be included elsewhere
in this  Agreement items which are not "material" within the meaning of the
immediately  preceding sentence for informational purposes and in order to
avoid any  misunderstanding, and such inclusion shall not be deemed to be an
agreement  by  the Sellers that such items are "material" or to further
define the meaning of  such term for purposes of this Agreement. With respect
to the Schedules hereto,  no disclosure made on any Schedule with respect to
any representation or  warranty shall be deemed to be made with respect to
any other representation  or  warranty unless expressly made in a schedule
related to such other  representation and warranty (by cross-reference or
otherwise) or unless, and  only to the extent that, it is apparent on the
face of such disclosure that  such  disclosure contains information which
also modifies another representation  and  warranty herein.

 

 

SECTION  10.4. _Amendment_ _._   This  Agreement may not be amended,
modified or supplemented except upon the execution  and delivery of a written
agreement executed by the parties hereto.

 

 

SECTION  10.5. _Waiver_ _._   Any of  the terms or conditions of this
Agreement, which may be lawfully waived, may  be  waived in writing at any
time by each party which is entitled to the benefits  thereof. Any waiver of
any of the provisions of this Agreement by any party  hereto shall be binding
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed  on  behalf of such
party. No failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement  shall be deemed
to or shall constitute a waiver of such provision and no waiver  of any of
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall  constitute a
waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar)  nor  shall
such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

 

 

SECTION  10.6. _Assignment_ _._   This  Agreement and the rights and
obligations hereunder shall not be assignable  or  transferable by any Buyer
or any Seller (including by operation of law in  connection with a merger or
consolidation of any Buyer or any Seller) without  the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, (a) prior to
Closing, a Buyer may assign its right to purchase the  Acquired Assets or any
of its other rights or any portion thereof hereunder  to  one or more
Affiliates of such Buyer without the prior written consent of  Sellers,
provided that such assignment shall not relieve any Buyer of its  obligations
hereunder and further provided that such assignment does not  adversely
impact or delay the obtaining of any material Consent required by  this 
Agreement to be obtained, and (b) a Buyer may assign its rights hereunder by 
way  of security for indebtedness necessary to fund the Buyers' obligations
hereunder  and such secured party may assign such rights by way of exercise
of remedies;  provided, however, that no assignment shall relieve any Buyer
of its obligations  hereunder. Any attempted assignment in violation of this
Section 10.6 shall  be  void.

SECTION  10.13. _Third  Parties_ _._   Nothing  herein expressed or
implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon  or  give to any
Person, other than the parties hereto and their permitted successors  or
assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this  Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  10.14. _Consent  to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_ _._   Each
of  the parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United  States District Court for the Southern District of New York located
in the  borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, or if such court does
not have  jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York
County,  for  the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising
out of this  Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each of the
parties hereto  irrevocably and fully waives the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the  maintenance of such suit, action or proceeding. Notwithstanding
the foregoing,  any suit, action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement
or any transaction  contemplated hereby may be brought in a different
jurisdiction if (a) the  subject matter of such suit, action or proceeding is
such that any judgment  or  Order arising therefrom must be implemented or
enforced solely and entirely  within such other jurisdiction, and (b) the
courts of such other jurisdiction  will not recognize, honor or enforce a
judgment or Order handed down by any  of  the courts described in the first
sentence of this Section 10.14. Each of the  parties further agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document  to such party's
respective address listed above in one of the manners set forth  in Section
10.7 hereof shall be deemed in every respect effective service of  process in
any such suit, action or proceeding. Nothing herein shall affect  the  right
of any Person to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.  Each 
of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection 
to  the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of
this  Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (a) the United
States  District Court for the Southern District of New York or (b) the
Supreme Court  of  the State of New York, New York County, and hereby
further irrevocably and  unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or
claim in any such court that  any such action, suit or proceeding brought in
any such court has been brought  in an inconvenient forum. The parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and  unconditionally waive trial by jury in any legal
action or proceeding relating  to this Agreement or any other agreement
entered into in connection therewith  and for any counterclaim with respect
thereto.

 

 

SECTION  10.15. _Enforcement  of Agreement_ _._   Each  party acknowledges
and agrees that the other party would be irreparably damaged  if any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance  with  their
specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement by a Seller or Buyer 
could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone. 
Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which any party may 
be  entitled at law or in equity, prior to Closing it shall be entitled to
enforce  any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance
and to  temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent
breaches  or  threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this
Agreement, without posting  any bond or other undertaking.
