1.3 _Purchase Price_. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay (or cause its
designee(s) to pay) to Sellers, and Sellers shall accept, together with
Buyers assumption of the Assumed Liabilities provided in _Section 1.2(b)_,
in full payment for the Assets, an aggregate amount in cash equal
to $133,000,000 less any Indebtedness represented by the Assumed Capital

1.5_ , _1.6_ and _1.7_. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay (or cause

1.4 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Within ninety (90) calendar days after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Sellers for their review
and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) a statement
setting forth the allocation of the Purchase Price among the Assets. In the
event of any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.6_
hereof and/or _Section 1.7_, Buyer shall amend such allocation to reflect the
amount of any such adjustment due to an increase or decrease in value of one
of the categories as to which the Purchase Price has been allocated or
deducted from each such category of Assets. Sellers and Buyer each agree to
report the sale and purchase of the Assets for all federal, state, local and
foreign Tax purposes, including the filing of IRS Form 8594, in a manner
consistent with such allocation and agree to take no position inconsistent
with such allocation, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. 



1.5 _Allocation of Expenses_. The following expenses attributable solely to
the operation of the Facilities shall be allocated between and are hereby
assumed by Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, as follows:



(a) _Taxes and Utilities_. All state, county, local and foreign real and
personal property taxes, franchise fees or Taxes, and ad valorem Taxes on real
or personal property (" _Periodic Taxes_ ") included in the Assets shall be
apportioned between Buyer and Sellers as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date,
computed on the basis of the fiscal year for which the same are levied based
upon the relative number of days in the portion of the fiscal year up to and
including the Closing Date and the relative number of days in the portion of
the fiscal year subsequent to the Closing Date, and all utility charges, gas
charges, electric charges, water charges, water rents and sewer rents with
respect to the Assets, if any, shall be apportioned between Buyer and Sellers
as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date, computed on the basis of the most
recent meter charges or, in the case of annual charges, on the basis of the
established fiscal year. In the event Buyer or Sellers shall receive bills
after the Closing Date for expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date that
were not prorated in accordance with this _Section 1.5(a)_, then Buyer or
Sellers, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the other party as to the
amount of the expense subject to proration and the responsible party shall
pay its portion of such expense (or, in the event such expense has been paid
on behalf of the responsible party, reimburse the other party for its portion
of such expenses). With respect to Taxes other than Periodic Taxes, in the
case that the Closing Date is not the end of the taxable period under
applicable law, such  



 

6  Taxes shall be determined as if the Closing Date were the end of a short
taxable period and income or loss for such period shall be determined on the
basis of closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing
Date.



(b) _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate in preparing,
executing and filing use, sales, transfer, documentary, stamp and similar Tax
Returns relating to the purchase and sale of the Assets. Buyer and Sellers
shall each be responsible for 50% of all such taxes. The party responsible
under applicable Law for remitting any such Taxes and fees shall notify the
other party in writing of the amount for which they are obligated to pay, and
such other party shall pay such amount to the responsible party within twenty

1.6 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.



(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth the Sellers good
faith estimate of the Closing Current Assets (the " _Estimated Closing Current
Assets_ "), together with reasonable supporting detail (such statement of the
Estimated Closing Current Assets, the " _Sellers  Closing Current Assets
Statement_"). The Sellers Closing Current Assets Statement will be prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of
each Sellers unaudited financial statements for the period ended June 30,
2005 and set forth on Schedule 1.6(a). As used herein, " _Closing Current
Assets_ " means an amount equal to the sum of (i) the Accounts Receivable1,
less accrued customer rebates and (ii) Inventory, in each case as of the close
of business on the Closing Date. In calculating the Sellers Closing Current
Assets, no effect shall be given to any act, event, circumstance, transaction

Agreement, the Buyers financing thereof, or any purchase accounting or
similar adjustments resulting from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein.



(b) No later than sixty (60) calendar days after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall in good faith prepare and deliver to the Sellers a statement indicating
the Buyers calculation of the Closing Current Assets, together with
reasonable supporting detail (such statement, the " _Buyer s Closing Current
Assets Statement_").



(c) If Sellers disagree with the determination of the Closing Current Assets
as shown on the Buyers Closing Current Assets Statement, Sellers shall notify
Buyer in writing of such disagreement within thirty (30) calendar days after
delivery of the Buyers Closing Current Assets Statement, which notice shall

7 disagreement in reasonable detail, identify the specific items involved and
the dollar amount of each such disagreement. After the end of such thirty
(30) calendar day period, neither Buyer nor Sellers may introduce additional
disagreements with respect to any item of the Closing Current Assets or
increase the amount of any disagreement, and any item not so identified shall
be deemed to be agreed to by Buyer and Sellers and will be final and binding
upon the parties.



(d) Buyer and Sellers agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
disagreement. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve all disagreements
properly identified by Sellers pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_ within thirty
(30) calendar days after delivery to Buyer of written notice of such
disagreement, then such disagreements shall be submitted for final
and binding resolution to Deloitte and Touche LLP to resolve such disagreements
(the " _Accounting Arbitrator_ "). The Accounting Arbitrator will only
consider those items and amounts set forth in the Buyers Closing
Current Assets Statement as to which Buyer and Sellers have disagreed on the
terms specified above and must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms
and provisions of this Agreement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to
Buyer and Sellers, as promptly as practicable and in any event within sixty
(60) calendar days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the
resolution of any such disagreement determined in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. The Accounting Arbitrator shall select as a resolution the
position of either Buyer or Sellers for each item of disagreement and may not
impose an alternative resolution. The Accounting Arbitrator shall make its
determination based exclusively on presentations and supporting material
provided by the parties and not pursuant to any independent review. The
determination of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon
Buyer and Sellers. The fees, expenses and costs of the Accounting Arbitrator
shall be paid by Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand based
upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to
each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party. Other than
such fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator, Buyer and Sellers shall
each be responsible for their own costs and expenses incurred in connection
with any actions taken pursuant to this _Section 1.6_.



(e) If the Closing Current Assets as finally determined in accordance with
this _Section 1.6_ (the " _Final Closing Current Assets_ ") are less than the
Estimated Closing Current Assets, the Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to such excess, and if the Final Closing Current Assets are greater
than the Estimated Closing Current Assets, the Buyer shall pay to Sellers an
amount equal to such excess. Any amount paid under this _Section 1.6(e)_
shall be referred to as an " _Audit Adjustment_." 



(f) If any Audit Adjustment is required to be paid by Sellers or Buyer
pursuant to this _Section 1.6_, such Audit Adjustment shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
recipient of the Audit Adjustment within five (5) Business Days after the
final determination of the amount of such reduction or increase in Purchase
Price, together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the prime
rate of interest reported in The Wall Street Journal on the date of such
payment, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over
360, from the Closing Date to the date of payment.



(g) Each party shall provide the other party and its representatives with
reasonable access to books and records and relevant personnel during the
resolution of any disputes that may arise under this _Section 1.6_.



 

8 1.7 _SMS Mill Adjustment_. Sellers agree that if Sellers pending agreement
to sell the SMS Mill Assets is terminated for any reason prior to, on or
after the Closing Date, as soon as practicable thereafter (or at the Closing
if such termination is prior to the Closing) Sellers shall convey, transfer,
assign and deliver to Buyer (or its designee(s)), free and clear of all
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances (excluding clause "e" of the
definition thereof), all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to the
SMS Mill Assets. Upon any such delivery of the SMS Mill Assets to Buyer
(subject to _Section 6.9_), the Purchase Price shall be increased by
$2,000,000 (the " _SMS Additional Purchase Price_ "), Buyer shall deliver to
Sellers an amount in cash equal to the SMS Additional Purchase Price and the
terms "Assets" and "Hannibal Assets" will be deemed to include the SMS Mill
Assets.

Material Adverse Effect.



 

10 3.2 _Authority of Sellers; Conflicts_.

all necessary corporate action and do not require any further authorization or
consent of any Seller or their respective stockholders. This Agreement has

valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer) is the
legal, valid and binding obligation of each Seller enforceable against each
of them in accordance with its terms, and each of the Seller Transaction
Agreements has been duly authorized by each Seller and upon execution and

transported, or arranged for the transportation of, any Hazardous Substances
to any place or location (i) in violation of any Environmental Laws, (ii)

Liabilities pursuant to any Environmental Laws.



(d) Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.14 and except as would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, there are no Actions
pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened that are based on or
related to any Environmental Matters relating to the Bens Run Facility or the

written notices that Sellers or the Bens Run Facility or the Specialty
Facility or any person whose liability has been retained or assumed

within the meaning of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("
_WARN_ ") or issued any notification of a plant closing or mass layoff at such
Facilities required by WARN.

date of this Agreement and the earlier of (x) the date this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to its terms and (y) the Closing Date:

and authorized representatives of Buyer (including, without limitation,
independent public accountants, financial advisors and attorneys) reasonable
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the
offices, properties, executive employees, books, Contracts, reports and
business and financial records (including computer files, retrieval
programs and similar documentation) of Sellers relating to the Assets and the
Facilities to the extent Buyer shall reasonably deem necessary and shall
furnish to Buyer or its authorized representatives such additional information

its obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.1_; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Sellers shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain consent from
any relevant third Persons to discharge Sellers obligations pursuant to this
_Section 5.1_. All information and documents obtained by Buyer pursuant to

suppliers of any Seller without Sellers prior written consent, and any such
communications permitted by Sellers shall be made in the presence of a

specifically provided for herein, any costs payable to  



 

21  third Persons in connection with obtaining any such consents shall be paid

agreement to assign any Asset which by its terms or by Law is nonassignable
without the consent of a third party or a Governmental Authority or is
cancelable by a third party or Governmental Authority in the event of an
assignment (" _Nonassignable Assets_ "). To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, in the event consents to the assignment thereof cannot be obtained, such
Nonassignable Assets shall be held, as of and from the Closing Date, by
Sellers or the applicable Affiliate of a Seller in trust for Buyer (or any
successor to or assignee of Buyer, by operation of law or otherwise) and the
covenants and obligations thereunder shall be performed by Buyer in
such Sellers or such Affiliates name and all benefits and obligations
existing thereunder shall be for Buyers account. Sellers shall take or cause
to be taken at Sellers reasonable expense such actions in its name or
otherwise as Buyer may reasonably request so as to provide Buyer with the
benefits of the Nonassignable Assets and to effect collection of money or
other consideration that becomes due and payable under the Nonassignable
Assets and Sellers or the applicable Affiliate of a Seller shall promptly pay
over to Buyer all money or other consideration received by it with respect to
all Nonassignable Assets.



(b) Sellers shall make or cause to be made all filings and submissions under
any Laws applicable to the Sellers for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein. Sellers shall coordinate and cooperate with the Buyer in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the Buyer may
reasonably request in connection with all of the foregoing. Without

the date of this Agreement all required Notification and Report Forms and
related material that it is required to file with the Federal Trade Commission
and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice under
the HSR Act.

Laws applicable to Buyer for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein. Buyer shall coordinate and cooperate with the Sellers in exchanging

request in connection with all of the foregoing. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall file promptly after the date of

is required to file with the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice under the HSR Act, and
Buyer shall be responsible for all filing fees under the HSR Act. Buyer shall
take, or cause to be taken by others, all commercially reasonable steps to
obtain and satisfy, at the earliest practicable date, all consents of each
applicable Governmental Authority to the assignment to Buyer of the Assets
pursuant to the terms and conditions hereof.

changes as may be required to comply with any applicable Law or to effect the

Inventory in existence at the Closing or manufactured within the three (3)
month period after the Closing, there shall be no limitations on Buyers
rights to use Sellers Logos. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer and its
designees shall be able to sell, use, distribute and take any other action

24 6.2 _Employees; Employee Benefits_.



(a) _Hiring of Employees_.



(i) Prior to the Closing Date, but effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall
make offers of employment on an at-will basis to all of the non-represented
Employees of the Bens Run Facility and the Specialty Facility (except those on
long-term disability or non-medical leave of absence, or who are consultants,
independent contractors providing individual services, agents and directors or
those who have retired) (each such non-represented Employee, upon accepting an
offer of employment from Buyer, a " _Transferred Employee_ "). Each such

types of employment. For purposes of the plans, programs and arrangements of
Buyer relating to compensation and employee benefits, each Transferred
Employee shall be credited with all years of service for which such
Transferred Employee was credited before the Closing Date under any similar
Benefit Plans for purposes of eligibility, vesting and severance but not for
purposes of benefit service or accrual or early retirement subsidies, and
except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits.
Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of Buyer following the Closing
to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee or to change the terms
and conditions or rate of salary or wages of any Transferred Employee; it
being understood that following the Closing Buyer shall be responsible for the
severance obligations with respect to each Transferred Employee under Buyers
severance plans.



(ii) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers against (A) any
severance Liabilities owed in connection with Sellers severance plans in
effect on the date of this Agreement and paid by Sellers to represented

not hired by Buyer as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (B) any Liabilities of Sellers arising out of an unfair labor
practice claim by the United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO Local Union no.

6.2(a)(i)_.

2005 (not including vacation time accrued prior to 2005 and carried into
2005) which any Transferred Employee is eligible to take pursuant to the
vacation policy maintained by the Sellers applicable to such Transferred
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date (" _Accrued Vacation Time_ "),
Buyer shall allow such Transferred Employee to use such Accrued Vacation Time
during that individuals employment with Buyer (notwithstanding any contrary
program or policy of Buyer), and if such employment is terminated prior to a

Buyer shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitation under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Buyer in which any
Transferred Employee (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Closing, except to the extent that such pre-
existing condition limitation would have been applicable under the comparable
Company welfare benefit plan immediately prior to the Closing. To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, Buyer shall recognize, or cause to be
recognized, the dollar amount of all expenses incurred by each Transferred
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible
and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which
they will be eligible to participate from and after the Closing.



(d) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing herein is intended to, and shall
not be construed to, create any third party beneficiary rights of any kind or
nature, including, without limitation, the right of any Transferred Employee
or other individual to seek to enforce any right to compensation, benefits, or
any other right or privilege of employment with Sellers or Buyer. 



(e) Sellers shall be solely responsible for any notices required to be given
under, and to otherwise comply with, WARN or similar Laws of any jurisdiction
relating to any plant closing or mass layoff (or similar triggering event)
caused by any Seller with respect to its Employees on or before the Closing.



6.3 _Insurance_. Sellers will keep insurance policies currently maintained
relating to the operation of the Facilities, the Assets and current Employees,

Facility and the Assets.

possible purchase or sale of all or any portion of the Facilities or the
Assets. At the Closing, Sellers shall assign to Buyer, to the extent
assignable, all rights, if any, of Sellers and their Affiliates under the Non-

Affiliates under any Non-Disclosure Agreement are not assignable, Sellers and
their Affiliates shall cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner with
Buyer at Buyers expense in taking any action reasonably requested by Buyer,
including without limitation, instituting litigation, to enforce for the
benefit of Buyer any and all rights of Sellers and their Affiliates against a

requesting such cooperation is entitled to indemnification from the other
party pursuant to _Section 9_ hereof, the requesting party shall pay the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such cooperation
(including reasonable legal fees and disbursements) by the party providing
such cooperation and by its officers, directors, employees and agents.



6.6 _Confidentiality_. For a period of three (3) years from the Closing Date,
Sellers and their Affiliates shall maintain the confidentiality of, and shall
not use for the benefit of themselves or others, any information concerning
the Assets and the operation of the Facilities treated by Sellers in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since April 1, 2005
as confidential (the " _Confidential Information_ ");  _provided_ , _however_

(B) which, after the date of this Agreement, becomes available publicly
through no fault of the disclosing party, (C) which is disclosed to any Seller
or any Affiliate thereof by another Person who acquired it without an
obligation of confidentiality to Buyer or (D) which is
independently developed by an employee of Sellers or any Affiliate thereof
who had no access to such information, and (iv) Sellers use of such
Confidential Information to protect or enforce their rights or perform their
obligations under this Agreement or in connection with Tax or other
regulatory filings, litigation, financial reporting or other reasonable

concerning the Facilities to any Person (other than Buyer and its
representatives, agents and advisors or Sellers representatives, Affiliates,
agents, advisors or employees, on a confidential basis).



6.9 _Hannibal Assets Removal_. Following the Closing, Sellers shall give Buyer
reasonable access to the Hannibal Facility in order for Buyer to remove the
Assets located at the Hannibal Facility which consist of tangible personal
property. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to remove such
Assets within six (6) months after Closing. If any of such Assets are not
removed from the Hannibal Facility within six (6) months after the Closing
then (a) for the following six (6) month period until all such Assets are
removed, Buyer shall pay a per month market level storage fee (provided
that such fee shall be no less than Sellers reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred in storing such Assets and providing Buyer with proper
access to and security of such Assets) (the " _Base Fee_ ") to Sellers for
the storage of such non-removed Assets at the Hannibal Facility and (b) for
the subsequent six (6) months until such Assets are removed, Buyer shall pay
the Base Fee plus 10% of the Base  



 

27  Fee to Sellers for the storage of such Assets (such additional percentage

foregoing obligations shall be deemed to be satisfied if (a) at the Closing at
least 75% of the volume of each product specified on the Supply Agreement
shall have been shipped or shall be ready for shipment and (b) at the Closing
Sellers shall have commitments from third parties (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) to deliver the remaining products set forth

amount which shall not exceed $9,500,000.



9.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_. After the Closing Date and subject to the
limitations set forth herein, Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Sellers and their Affiliates (the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against
any and all Liabilities and Expenses incurred by such Seller Indemnitees
solely arising from (a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer
contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, in
each case without giving effect to any qualifications and

Assigned Contracts, except in each case with respect to Excluded Liabilities
or matters for which any Buyer Indemnitee is indemnified under _Section
9.1(a)_.



9.3 _Notice of Claims_. Any Buyer Indemnitee or Sellers Indemnitee seeking
indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give promptly to
the party obligated to provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the
" _Indemnitor_ ") a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification  



 

31  hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount
or the method of computation of the amount of such claim, and the basis
thereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of any Indemnified Party
to give the Claim Notice promptly as required by this _Section 9.3_ shall not
affect such Indemnified Partys rights under this _Section 9_ except to the
extent such failure is actually prejudicial to the rights and obligations of
the Indemnitor, and then only to the degree so prejudiced.



9.4 _Claims_.



(a) In order for a party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving an Action or
demand made by any third Person against the Indemnified Party, such
Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable
detail, of the third Person claim promptly after receipt by such Indemnified
Party of written notice of the third Person claim, _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give written notice promptly as
required by this _Section 9.4(a)_ shall not affect such Indemnified
Partys rights under this _Section 9_ except to the extent such failure is
actually prejudicial to the rights and obligations of the Indemnitor, and then
only to the degree so prejudiced.



(b) In the event of the initiation of any legal proceeding against the
Indemnified Party by a third Person, the Indemnitor shall have the sole and
absolute right after the receipt of written notice, at its option and at its
own expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice (such counsel to
be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) and to control, defend
against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Action or demand which
relates to any Liability or Expense indemnified against hereunder; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Indemnified Party may participate in any such
proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its expense. The Indemnified
Party agrees to cooperate fully with the Indemnitor in connection with the
defense, negotiation or settlement of any such legal proceeding, claim or
demand. Such cooperation shall include the retention and the provision of
records and information which is reasonably relevant to such third Person
claim, and making employees available in a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to defend such Action or
demand, and the Indemnified Party defends against or otherwise deals with any
such Action or demand, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel, at the
expense of the Indemnitor, and control the defense of such Action. Neither the
Indemnitor nor the Indemnified Party may settle any such proceeding, which
settlement obligates the other party to pay money, to perform obligations or
to admit liability without the written consent of the other party, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.



(c) Whenever the Indemnified Party shall have given a Claim Notice to the
Indemnitor that does not involve a third Person claim, the Indemnitor may,
within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of such Claim Notice, notify
the Indemnified Party that the Indemnitor disputes the claim for
indemnification set forth in such Claim Notice and the basis for such dispute
(a " _Dispute Notice_ "). If, with respect to the claim for indemnification
set forth in a Claim Notice, no Dispute Notice is given to the Indemnified
Party within such thirty (30) day period, the claim shall be deemed valid,
and the Indemnitor shall be obligated to pay to the Indemnified Party the
amount specified in the Claim Notice with respect to such claim. If a Dispute
Notice is given to the Indemnified Party, the parties shall first attempt
to resolve the  



 

32  dispute in good faith. If the parties are unable to resolve such dispute
within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Dispute Notice by
the Indemnified Party, either party may resort to any remedies available in
law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction to resolve such dispute.



9.5 _Limitations_.



(a) Any indemnity payment hereunder shall be treated for Tax purposes as an
adjustment of the Purchase Price to the extent such characterization is
proper or permissible under relevant Tax law, including court decisions,
statutes, regulations and administrative promulgations.



(b) All Liabilities and Expenses recoverable by an Indemnified Party under
_Section 9.1_ or _9.2_ shall be net of recoveries, contributions,
indemnification or other similar payments from third Persons actually received
by such Indemnified Party, less the reasonable costs of recovering amounts
(including but not limited to any insurance proceeds) from such third
Persons. Any such amounts received by an Indemnified Party with respect to any
indemnity claim after it has received an indemnity payment hereunder shall be
promptly paid over to the Indemnitor; provided that the Indemnified Party
shall not be obligated to pay over any such amount in excess of the amount
paid by the Indemnitor to the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim.
The Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to receive
such indemnification payments from third Persons.



(c) Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of Law and
injunctive relief and except with respect to fraud, if the Closing occurs,
this _Section 9_ shall be the exclusive remedy for breaches of this Agreement
or otherwise in respect of the sale of the Assets contemplated hereby.



(d) If any Seller breaches any covenant in _Section 6.6_ (Confidentiality),
Sellers acknowledge such violation or breach may cause irreparable injury to
Buyer, the amount of which may be impossible to estimate or determine and
which may not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. Accordingly,
Buyer shall be entitled to specific performance, temporary and permanent
injunctive relief or such other equitable remedies as may be available from
any court of competent jurisdiction without the necessity of posting a bond.



(e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Indemnitor
shall be liable pursuant to this _Section 9_ to any Indemnified Party for
special, punitive, consequential or incidental damages; _provided_ , _however_
, that the foregoing shall not preclude recovery by an Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Section 9_ of any special, punitive, consequential or
incidental damages actually paid by an Indemnified Party as a result of any
third party claim. 



9.6 _Additional Environmental Terms_. 



(a) In accordance with  _Section 9.4_ and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Sellers shall control the defense or negotiation
(including, without limitation, any investigatory, response or remedial
actions) of any matter arising under or pursuant to Environmental Laws for
which Sellers have an indemnification or other obligation  



 

33  under this Agreement (an " _Environmental Claim_ "), including its
compromise or settlement, with counsel and environmental consultant
selected by Sellers and reasonably acceptable to Buyer; _provided_ _however_
, that Sellers, their Affiliates and representatives shall not interfere
unreasonably with the operations of the business of the Buyer and its
Affiliates; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer shall be entitled to
assume control of the defense or negotiation of any such Environmental Claim
with counsel and environmental consultant selected by Buyer and reasonably
acceptable to Sellers if (i) Sellers fail to assume such defense within
thirty (30) days after receiving notice of such Environmental Claim, (ii)
Sellers fail to take diligent action as necessary to address any such
Environmental Claim in a Commercially Reasonable Manner (as defined below in
_Section 9.6(c)_), or (iii) if any bankruptcy, reorganization or other case
or proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any dissolution or
liquidation proceeding is commenced in respect of any Seller.



(b) Except to the extent not reasonably practicable due to an emergency,
Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, with respect to any matter managed and
controlled by the other, shall have the right to (i) participate in any
meetings or material negotiations with any third party (excluding counsel,
consultants or other experts retained by the controlling party) with respect
to any Environmental Claim and shall be provided with reasonable advance
notice of the same; and (ii) review in advance and provide comments on any
documents proposed to be submitted to Governmental Authorities or other third
parties (excluding counsel, consultants or other experts retained by the
controlling party). The controlling party shall keep the non-controlling
party reasonably informed with respect to any Environmental Claim and shall
promptly provide the non-controlling party with copies of all documents
provided to, or received from, any Governmental Authority or any other third
Person in connection with any Environmental Claim.



(c) With respect to any Environmental Claim, Buyer and Sellers shall each act
only in a Commercially Reasonable Manner. For purposes of this _Section
9.6(c)_, "Commercially Reasonable Manner" shall be determined from the
perspective of a reasonable business person (acting without regard to the
availability of indemnification hereunder) to achieve compliance with
Environmental Law or to minimize liability to third parties.

Agreement if, as to any party, it is authorized in writing by an
authorized representative of such party. The failure of any party hereto to
enforce at any time any provision of this

right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No

provision or provisions shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
