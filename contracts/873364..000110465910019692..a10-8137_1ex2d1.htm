a representation or warranty, the Buyer shall notify the Seller in
accordance with Section 9.1.2(b) and shall oppose and defend and cause
the relevant Mepha Group Companies to oppose and defend such third party
claim (the " **Third-Party Claim** "), and the Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts in assisting the Buyer or the Mepha Group
Companies, at the Buyers costs and expenses, in the defense of such Third-
Party Claim.

Companies shall not settle any such claims without the prior written consent
