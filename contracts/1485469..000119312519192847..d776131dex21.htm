_WITNESSETH:_

 

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, it is

extended and amended from time to time as permitted under, or required by,
this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase any and all of the outstanding
shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (each, a "
_Share_ ," and collectively, " _Shares_ ") at a price per Share of $31.00, in
cash, net of applicable withholding, without interest (such amount, or any
other amount per share paid in the Offer in accordance with this Agreement,
the " _Offer Price_ ");

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition of the Company by Parent, and on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "),
following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as
a direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and pursuant to which each Share
that is not validly tendered and irrevocably accepted for payment pursuant to
the Offer (except as provided herein) shall be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration;

WHEREAS, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the Merger
shall be governed by and effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and,
subject to the terms of this Agreement, effected as soon as practicable
following the consummation (as defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) of the
Offer;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
determined that the Offer is advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, (iii) approved and declared advisable this

unanimously approved this Agreement and declared it advisable, and have
authorized Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, to enter into this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer
and the Merger; and

   

WHEREAS, the sole stockholder of Merger Sub has duly executed a written

ARTICLE I.

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, unless
otherwise agreed in writing by Parent and the Company, no earlier than August
14, 2019 and no later than August 19, 2019, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act, the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to
cause Merger Sub to, irrevocably accept for payment, and pay for, any Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of the conditions set forth in
_Annex I_ (as they may be amended in accordance with this Agreement, the "
_Offer Conditions_ ").

 

(b) To the extent permitted by Law, Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve
the right, at any time, to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition
(other than the Minimum Condition), to increase the Offer Price or to modify
the terms of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior
written consent of the Company (in its sole and absolute discretion), neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall (i) reduce the maximum number of Shares sought to
be purchased in the Offer (other than pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.1(h)_),
(ii) reduce the Offer Price (other than pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.1(h)_)
or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) change, modify
or waive the Minimum Condition, (iv) impose conditions to the Offer that are
in addition to the Offer Conditions, or modify or amend any existing Offer
Conditions, in a manner that is adverse to the holders of Shares, (v) except
as otherwise required or expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 1.1(d)_,
extend or otherwise change the Expiration Time, (vi) provide for any
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act or (vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement the Offer in any
manner adverse to the holders of Shares. The Offer may not be terminated
prior to its scheduled Expiration Time, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article VII_.

 

(c) The Offer shall initially expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the date that is twenty one (21) Business Days (calculated in accordance with
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement of the
Offer (such initial expiration date and time of the Offer, the "
_Initial Expiration Time_ ") or, if the Offer has been extended pursuant to
and in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.1(d)_, the date and time to which the
Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such
later expiration date and time to which the Offer has been so extended, the "
_Expiration Time_ ").

 



-2- 

    

(d) Subject to _Article VII_ , Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, (or in the case of _clause (iv)_ below, Merger Sub may) extend
the Offer from time to time:

 

(i) for the minimum period as required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof or The New York
Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") applicable to the Offer;

 

(ii) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, the Company brings or shall
have brought any Proceeding in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, in which case the Expiration Time shall be
extended (A) for the period during which such Proceeding is pending or (B) by
such other time period established by the Governmental Entity presiding over
such Proceeding, as the case may be, but, in each case of clauses (A) and (B),
not past the End Date;

 

(iii) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, any of the Offer
Conditions has not either been (A) satisfied or (B) waived by Parent and
Merger Sub (to the extent such waiver is permitted under this Agreement and
applicable Law), in which case Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, extend the Offer, in consecutive periods of five (5) Business Days
each (with each such period to end at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the
last Business Day of such period) (or such other duration as may be agreed to
by Parent and the Company) on such number of occasions as shall be necessary
to permit the satisfaction of such Offer Conditions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer to a date later than
the End Date; or

 

(iv) if, at the then-scheduled Expiration Time, (A) the full amount of the
Debt Financing has not been funded and will not be available to be funded at
the Offer Acceptance Time and the Closing and (B) Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree in writing that (1) the Company would be entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_ and receive the
Parent Termination Fee, and (2) all Offer Conditions set forth in paragraphs
(d), (e), (f) and (j) of _Annex I_ will be deemed to be satisfied or waived at
the Expiration Time of the Offer after giving effect to any extension
pursuant to this _clause (iv)_ (if such Offer Conditions were actually
satisfied at the time of such extension), Merger Sub shall have the right in
its sole discretion to extend the Offer on up to four (4) occasions in
consecutive increments of five (5) Business Days each (with each such period
to end at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last Business Day of such
period) (or such other duration as may be agreed to by Parent and the
Company); _provided_ , that Merger Sub shall not be permitted to extend the
Offer to a date later than the End Date and _provided_ , _further_ , that for
the avoidance of doubt, no extension pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
1.1(d)(iv)_ shall preclude the Company from exercising its right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_.

 

Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, extend the
Offer in any manner except as required or permitted pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(d)_.

 



-3- 

    

(e) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, including satisfaction or waiver of all of the Offer Conditions,
(i) prior to 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business Day (determined
using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) immediately following the
Expiration Time, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
irrevocably accept for payment (the time of acceptance for payment, the "
_Offer Acceptance Time_ ") all Shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and (ii) at or as promptly as
practicable following the Offer Acceptance Time (but in any event within two
(2) Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) thereafter) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, pay for all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer at the Offer Acceptance Time; _provided_ , that with respect to
Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet
been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee, Merger Sub
shall be under no obligation to make any payment for such Shares unless and
until such shares are delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such
guarantee. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, at or
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the funds that, when taken together with
available cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries, are necessary to purchase
any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer, and shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of Merger Subs
obligations under this Agreement.

(f) The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share shall be paid on the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement. The Company agrees
that no Shares held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered
pursuant to the Offer.

 

(g) Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article
VII_ , neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall terminate or withdraw the Offer
prior to any scheduled Expiration Time without the prior written consent of
the Company (in its sole and absolute discretion). In the event this Agreement
is validly terminated in accordance with _Article VII_ , Merger Sub shall
promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day) following such
termination irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not
acquire any Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer or this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with this Agreement, Merger Sub shall promptly
return, or cause any depositary acting on behalf of Merger Sub to promptly
return, all tendered shares to the tendering stockholders in accordance with
applicable Law.

 

(h) Subject to the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, the Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately and
proportionately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Shares), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to Shares
occurring on or after the date hereof and at or prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to the holders of
Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such action.

 

Section 1.2 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the DGCL (including Section 251(h) thereof), Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving

 



-4- 

    

 corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and as a direct,
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in the DGCL (including Section 251(h) thereof). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
Liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
Liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.3 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. The Merger shall be
governed by and effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL, without a vote of
the stockholders of the Company. The parties agree to take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as
practicable following the consummation (within the meaning of Section 251(h)
of the DGCL) of the Offer, without a vote of the stockholders of the Company
in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

 

Section 1.4 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted hereunder) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
hereunder) of those conditions at the Closing), the closing of the Merger
(the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (i) at 10:00 a.m. local time at the
offices of Lowenstein Sandler LLP, 1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New
York 10020 (or remotely via the electronic exchange of documents) as soon as
practicable following the consummation (as defined in Section 251(h) of the
DGCL) of the Offer, but no later than the date of, and immediately following,
the Offer Acceptance Time or (ii) at such other place, date and time as the
Company and Parent may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing
actually occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

 

Section 1.5 _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the Company shall file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the
" _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with, and containing such
information as is required by, the relevant provisions of the DGCL in order to
effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed between the parties
and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such time is hereinafter referred
to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.6 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Merger Sub or the Company, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety as

shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable
Law (subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.12_).

 

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Merger Sub or the Company, the bylaws of Company shall

hereto, and as so amended and restated

 



-5- 

    

 shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended
in accordance with the provisions thereof, the provisions of the amended and
restated certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and
applicable Law (subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.12_).

 

Section 1.7 _Directors_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent the resignation of each
member of the Company Board, and such resignation shall be effective as of,
and contingent upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their

earlier death, resignation or removal, in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise
provided by Law.

 

Section 1.8 _Officers_. The officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or

ARTICLE II.

 

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the holders of any
of the following securities:

(i) _Conversion of Shares_. Each Share that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares, shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
$31.00 in cash, net of applicable withholding, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of
such Shares in the manner provided in this _Article II_. All of the Shares
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
_Article II_ shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled and cease to
exist, and each holder of Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are represented by a valid certificate (a "
_Certificate_ ") or Shares represented by book-entry immediately prior to the
Effective Time (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), shall thereafter cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which the Shares have been converted.

 

(ii) _Cancellation of Parent, Merger Sub and Company Owned Shares_. Each
Share that is issued immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held
in treasury by the Company and each Share that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Company, Parent, 

 



-6- 

    

 Merger Sub (including any Shares acquired in the Offer) or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange for such cancellation.

 

(iii) _Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. From and

demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with,
and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares,
the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as described in  _Section_ __ _
2.1(a)(i)_, but instead, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and

of applicable tax withholding, without interest, as set forth in _Section_ __
_ 2.1(a)(i)_.

(iii) At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _

different number of shares or a different class of shares, in each case, by

hereunder, to the extent appropriate to provide the same economic effect as

formerly representing such Shares shall be paid to any such transferee only

accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share

the Surviving Corporation, and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in a customary amount

__ _ 2.4(i)_, Parent or the Surviving Corporation) shall deliver, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than thirty (30)
days, (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-I or P-I or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, (iii)

(iv) in mutual funds investing in one or more of any such assets or (v) such
other manner as is set forth in the paying agent agreement contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.4(a)_ and approved by the Company prior to the Effective

investments of the Payment Fund; (B) the Payment Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the cash
amounts contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.1_; or
(C) all or any portion of the Payment Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the
Paying Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ for any

Person to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Payment Fund
so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times fully available for
distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to
make the payments contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 1.1(e)_ and _Section_ __ _

(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that

Article II

 



-11- 

    

 shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent or
its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

Company, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

 

(k) _Withholding_. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
under the Code or any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law or under
any other applicable Law; _provided_ that, Paying Agent, Parent, and Merger
Sub, as applicable, shall notify (in reasonable detail) the Company, as
promptly as practicable prior to the payment date, of any such withholding
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company to
reduce such withholding, other than U.S. federal backup withholding or
withholding on amounts treated as compensation. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid. 

Section 2.5 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be

rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors

established and maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting as required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act.
Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes policies and procedures
that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company, (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with

reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements. The Company maintains disclosure
controls and procedures as required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
effective to ensure that all material information relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries required to be disclosed in the Companys periodic reports
under the Exchange Act and within the time periods specified in the SECs
rules is made known to the Companys principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer by others within the Company or any of its

 Subsidiaries, and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting the Companys principal executive officer and its principal

significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information or (y) any fraud or allegation of fraud, whether or not material,
that involves (or involved) management or other employees who have (or had) a
significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of
the NYSE. The Companys management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and such assessment concluded that

at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, if and only if the Company
receives a _bona fide_ , written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from
a material breach of the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, the Company Board
may (x) make an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement
in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(ii)_, in each such case if
and only if (A) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, is a Superior Proposal and (B) the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that its failure to effect an Adverse Company Board

respect to such Acquisition Proposal, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that, notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(f)_,
the Company Board may not effect an Adverse Company Board Recommendation
Change and the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing _clause (y)_ unless:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at
least five (5) Business Days in advance (the " _Superior Proposal Notice
Period_ "), of its intention to effect such an Adverse Company Board
Recommendation Change or termination (which notice itself shall not
constitute an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change or termination) with
respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person
or group making such Superior Proposal, and shall have contemporaneously
provided a copy of all relevant proposed definitive transaction agreements

-47- 

    

(ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated with, and
shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate with, Parent in good faith
during the Superior Proposal Notice Period in order to enable Parent to revise
the terms of this Agreement in such a manner that would eliminate the need
for taking such action (and would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal);

 

(iii) following the Superior Proposal Notice Period and after considering
the results of any negotiations and giving effect to any proposals,
amendments or modifications offered, made or agreed to in writing by Parent,
if any, the Company Board (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) shall have determined in good faith, that such
Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms
of an Acquisition Proposal that was previously the subject of a
notice hereunder shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but
with respect to any such subsequent notices the Superior Proposal Notice
Period shall be deemed to be four (4) Business Days rather than five (5)
Business Days); and 

(iv) if the Company Board determines to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.5(f)_ and _Section_ __ _
7.1(d)(ii)_, the Company pays the applicable Company Termination Fee to Parent

applicable Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ to the contrary,
at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company Board may make an
Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to an Intervening
Event, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that its failure to effect
an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to an Intervening
Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the Company Board may not
effect such an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change unless:

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent at least
four (4) Business Days in advance (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ ")
of its intention to effect such an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change
(which notice itself shall not constitute an Adverse Company Board
Recommendation Change), which notice shall specify the relevant details of
such Intervening Event;

(ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated with, and
shall have caused its Representatives to negotiate with, Parent in good faith
during the Intervening Event Notice Period in order to enable Parent to revise
the terms of this Agreement so that the failure to make such an Adverse
Company Board Recommendation Change would no longer be inconsistent with the
directors exercise of their fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholder
under applicable Law; and

 

(iii) following the Intervening Event Notice Period and after considering
the results of any negotiations and giving effect to any proposals,
amendments or modifications offered, made or agreed to, in writing, by Parent,
if any, the

 



-48- 

    

 Company Board (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) shall have determined in good faith, that the failure to make
such an Adverse Company Board Recommendation Change continues to be
inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholder under applicable Law (it being understood and agreed
that any material changes to the circumstances surrounding the Intervening
Event that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder shall require a
new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to any such
subsequent notices the Intervening Event Notice Period shall be deemed to be
three (3) Business Days rather than four (4) Business Days).

ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby prior to the valid
termination hereof, (B) adversely affect the rights of the Company thereunder

business combination with, the Company shall not be required to enter into a
new or revised confidentiality agreement, and such confidentiality agreement
(or such confidentiality agreement modified to the extent permitted by the
following _clause (y)_ ) shall be deemed to be an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement so long as such confidentiality agreement is not modified, including
the waiver of any provision thereof (in each case, other than a modification
to the extent permitted by the following _clause (y)_ ), after the date hereof
and (y) a confidentiality agreement shall not fail to constitute an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement by virtue of it granting a waiver with respect to,

Person to make an Acquisition Proposal.

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and during the one (1)-year period
immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time (collectively, the " _Company Employees_ "), (i) base salary or base
hourly wage rate, if applicable, and annual cash incentive compensation
opportunities (excluding, long term or equity-based awards, or any change
in control or retention bonuses) that, in each case, are no less favorable
than were provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective
Time, and (ii) all other compensation and employee benefits (other than long
term or equity-based awards, change in control or retention bonuses, and
defined benefit or non-qualified arrangements) that are no less favorable in
the aggregate than were provided to the Company Employee immediately before
the Effective Time.

 



-53- 

    

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, subject to applicable Law and applicable Tax qualification
requirements, cause any employee benefit or compensation plans sponsored or
maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in
which the Company Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing
Date (collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize all service of
each Company Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries (and any
predecessor thereto) prior to the Closing Date that is reflected in the books
and records of the Company, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of
benefits under such Post-Closing Plans; except to the extent that recognizing
such service would result in a duplication of benefits and _provided_ , that
such recognition of service shall not apply for purposes of benefit accrual
under any Post-Closing Plan that is a final average pay defined benefit
retirement plan. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that provides medical,
dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in which such Company
Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and any insurer or service provider under
the applicable Post-Closing Plan (i) cause any preexisting condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be waived with
respect to such Company Employee to the extent such limitation would have been
waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) credit
each Company Employee for any co-payments or deductibles incurred by
such Company Employee in such plan year for purposes of any applicable
deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such Post-
Closing Plan. Such credited expenses shall also count toward any annual or
lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply
under the terms of the applicable plan.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)_, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to assume, honor and continue the Company Benefit Plans and
compensation, employment and severance arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, and the Merger shall be deemed to constitute a "change in control" or
"change of control" (or similar words to such effect) under all such Company
Benefit Plans and under all compensation, employment and severance
arrangements and agreements. Nothing in this Section shall limit the ability
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms, as in effect
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) _Section 5.8(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
any actions taken by the Company since January 1, 2019 to mitigate or
minimize the impact of the tax consequences of Section 280G of the Code
(including as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby under all
Company Benefit Plans) on any individual that is regarded as a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1) with respect to the Company.

 



-54- 

    

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as
Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to
effect such actions relating to the 401(k) plan of the Company (the " _401(k)
Plan_ ") and any Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the
Code as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate, including amending or
terminating the 401(k) Plan or any such other plan prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan or any such other plan and
applicable Law;  _provided_ , that (i) such action does not preclude the
immediate participation of the Company Employees in any successor 401(k) plan
or other replacement plan and (ii) no such action shall be effective prior to
the Effective Time. 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or
other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent. Notwithstanding
any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section_ __
_ 5.8_ shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Company
Employee or current or former service provider of the Company or its
Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 

Section 5.9 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective the Offer and the Merger as promptly as
practicable, including (i) preparing and filing all forms, registrations and
notifications with any Governmental Entities or third parties required to be
filed to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
using reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions to consummating the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) using reasonable best efforts to
obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent,
authorization, expiration or termination of a waiting period, permit, Order
or approval of, waiver or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity (including
furnishing all information and documentary material required under the HSR
Act) required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Offer or the
Merger or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, (iv)
subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, defending any lawsuits or
other legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and (v) using
reasonable best efforts with respect to the execution and delivery of all
such instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances and doing all other things
reasonably necessary or desirable to consummate the Offer and the Merger and
to fully carry out the purposes or intent of this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the Offer and the Merger and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required consents,
authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental
Entity undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_.
In that regard, prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with
the other parties to this Agreement with respect to and provide any necessary
information and assistance as the other parties may reasonably request with
respect to all notices, submissions or filings made by or on behalf of such
party or any of its Affiliates with any Governmental Entity or any other
information supplied by or on behalf of such party or any of its
Affiliates to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger.

 



-55- 

    

 Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this
Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other parties with copies of (or, in
the case of oral communications, advise the other parties orally of) any
communication from or to any Governmental Entity regarding the Offer or the
Merger, and permit the other parties to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with, any
proposed communication or submission with any such Governmental Entity. To the
extent not prohibited by the applicable Governmental Entity, no party or any
of its Affiliates shall participate in any meeting or teleconference with any
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Offer and the
Merger unless it consults with the other parties in advance and gives the
other parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Company may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_ as "
_Antitrust Counsel Only Material_." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient
and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express written permission is obtained in
advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case
may be) or its legal counsel. Materials provided pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 5.9_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of
the Company and the Merger, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.
In addition to the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_, a
party hereto may request entry into a joint defense agreement as a condition
to providing any materials hereunder. Upon delivery of such a request, the
parties shall work in good faith to enter into a joint defense agreement to
create and preserve attorney-client privilege in a form and substance mutually
acceptable to the parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Parent, acting reasonably and in good faith, shall control all aspects of the
parties efforts to gain antitrust regulatory clearance either before any
Governmental Entity or in any action brought to enjoin the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to any antitrust Law.

 

(c) The Company and Parent shall make or file, as promptly as practicable,
with the appropriate Governmental Entity all filings, forms, registrations
and notifications required to be filed to consummate the Offer or the Merger
under the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust Law, and subsequent to
such filings, the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, as promptly as practicable, respond to inquiries from
Governmental Entities, or provide any supplemental information that may be
requested by Governmental Entities, in connection with filings made with such
Governmental Entities. The Company and Parent shall file their notification
and report forms under the HSR Act no later than ten (10) Business Days after
the date hereof and shall promptly file any comparable notifications and
report forms under any other applicable antitrust Law. In the event that the
parties receive a request for information or documentary material pursuant to
the HSR Act or pursuant to any other applicable antitrust Law (a " _Second
Request_ "), the parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to
submit an appropriate response to, and to certify compliance with, such Second
Request as promptly as practicable, and the parties hereto shall cause their
respective counsel to closely cooperate during the entirety of any such
Second Request review process.

 



-56- 

    

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Parent shall, in order to permit the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions set
forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of _Annex I_ so as to permit the Closing to
occur as promptly as practicable and in any event before the End Date, (i)
propose, negotiate, commit to, effect and agree to, by consent decree, hold
separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding
separate, and other disposition of and restriction on the businesses, assets,
properties, product lines, and equity interests of, or changes to the conduct
of business of, the Company after the Effective Time, Parent and their
respective Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Affiliates), (ii) create, terminate, or divest relationships, ventures,
contractual rights or obligations of the Surviving Corporation or Parent or
their respective Affiliates, and (iii) otherwise take or commit to take any
action that would limit Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets,
equity interests, product lines or properties of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (including any of their respective Affiliates). If requested
by Parent, the Company will agree to any action contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_; _provided_ , that any such agreement or action is
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing,
in no event will the Company (and the Company will not permit any of its
Affiliates to) propose, negotiate, effect or agree to any such actions without
the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing
to the contrary, in no event shall any party hereto or its Subsidiaries be
obligated to undertake or agree to undertake (and Parent shall not be
obligated to request or authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
undertake) (x) any sale, divestiture, disposition or other remedial measure
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ that is not contingent on the
consummation of the Merger or (y) any efforts or any sale, divestiture,
disposition or other remedial measure, in each case, pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_, if such efforts or action would have, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the business of Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_, if any administrative or judicial
action or Proceeding, including any Proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the Offer or the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative
of any antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or Proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Offer or the
Merger.

 

(f) Except as specifically required by this Agreement, from the date hereof
until the earlier of the Effective Date and the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire by merging or
consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets of
or equity in, or by any other manner, any Person or portion thereof, or
otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition,
merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any
material delay in the obtaining of any consent, approval, authorization,
declaration, waiver, license, franchise, permit, certificate or order of
any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period or
(ii) materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



-57- 

    

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly obtain any consents of third parties with respect to any
Company Material Contracts or other Contracts set forth on _Section_ __ _
3.3(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, as may be necessary or appropriate
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or required by
the terms of any such Company Material Contract or other Contract as a result
of the execution, performance or consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, in each case to the extent reasonably requested in
writing by Parent, subject to the proviso in the immediately following
sentence. In the event that such third party consent described in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9(g)_ shall not be obtained, the Company and Parent shall
determine reasonably and jointly whether to take any further actions with
respect to such Company Material Contracts or other Contracts; _provided_ ,
that without its consent (such consent to be given or withheld in its sole
discretion), the Company shall not be required to pay any amount or change
Contract terms or its business practices in order to obtain any such consent.

 

Section 5.10 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute may become, or
may purport to be, applicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and
Parent and their respective boards of directors shall grant such approvals and
take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate, or otherwise minimize, the effects of such Takeover Statute on the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall be construed to permit Parent or Merger Sub
to do any act that would constitute a violation or breach of, or as a waiver
of any of the Companys rights under, any other provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing the
execution of this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by
the parties and that the parties shall consult with each other before issuing
any other press release or making any other public announcement with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public announcement without the prior
consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned); _provided_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of
the other party, issue such press release or make such public announcement
(a) so long as such statements are consistent with previous statements made
jointly by, or with the approval of, the Company and Parent or (b) (after
prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances) to the
extent required by applicable Law or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall not apply to (i) any public release or public
announcement (x) made or proposed to be made by the Company in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal, a Superior Proposal, an Adverse Company Board
Recommendation Change or an Intervening Event or any action taken pursuant
thereto, in each case, that does not violate _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ or (y) in
connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) ordinary course communications
by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates regarding this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby to existing or prospective general
and limited partners, equity holders, members, managers and investors of
any Affiliates of such Person, in each case, who are subject to customary
confidentiality restrictions.

Section 5.12 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors and officers of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries and each Person who served as a director,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at
the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, together with such Persons heirs, executors and
administrators, the " _Covered Persons_ ") to the same extent such Persons
are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
the Company Organizational Documents, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, or equivalent organizational or governing documents, of any
Subsidiary of the Company and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence
on the date of this Agreement with any directors, officers and employees that
have been made available to Parent (collectively, the " _Existing
Indemnification Arrangements_ ") arising out of acts or omissions in their
capacity as directors, officers or agents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting
the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless the Covered Persons to the fullest extent permitted by Law for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the process resulting in and
the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. From and after the Effective Time, subject to any
requirements of applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any actual or
threatened Proceeding or investigation with respect to the matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_ in accordance with
the procedures (if any) set forth in the Existing Indemnification
Arrangements; _provided_ , __ that the applicable Covered Person provides an
undertaking to repay such advance if it is ultimately determined by a final
non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Covered
Person is not entitled to indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_
or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
Proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective
Time) is made or threatened against such Persons with respect to matters
subject to indemnification or advancement hereunder on or prior to the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
5.12(a)_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
Proceeding or investigation.

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and the
organizational documents of each Subsidiary of the Company shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification of
and advancement of expenses to Covered Persons for periods at or prior to the
Effective Time than are set forth in Exhibits A and B annexed hereto. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnification agreements, if any,
in existence on the date of this Agreement with any directors, officers and
employees that have been made available to Parent shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

 



-59- 

    

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect policies of directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance that collectively provide coverage for
matters arising on or before the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_")
that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the existing policies of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (true and complete copies of which have been previously made
available to Parent) or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay
annual premiums for the DandO Insurance in excess of three hundred percent
(300%) of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may
purchase, prior to the Effective Time, at prevailing market rates (and in no
event at a cost greater than three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of DandO
Insurance), a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation
the transactions contemplated hereby and full prior acts coverage for all
acts or omissions taking place before the tail becomes effective.

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
5.12_.

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each of the Covered Persons. The rights to
indemnification, advancement, insurance coverage and the other rights provided
for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any
Covered Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

Section 5.13 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
(taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, advisable or proper to arrange and obtain the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters on or prior to the Closing Date on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including to: (i)
maintain in effect the Commitment Letters and any Definitive Financing
Agreements in accordance with their terms until the funding of the Financing
to the Parent on the Closing Date; (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions to the funding of the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letters
and the Definitive Financing Agreements applicable to Parent or one or more of
its Affiliates that are within its control; (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive debt financing agreements on the terms and conditions contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter (including, if necessary, any "flex" provisions)
(the " _Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_ ") and definitive equity
financing

 



-60- 

    

 agreements on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Equity Commitment
Letter (the " _Definitive Equity Financing Agreements_ " and together with the
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, the " _Definitive Financing Agreements_
"); and (iv) subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Financing
Conditions, cause the Debt Financing Sources and Equity Investor, as
applicable, to consummate the Financing, and fund the amounts thereunder on
the Closing Date. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice after the
occurrence of any of the following: (A) any material breach or material
default by any party to the Commitment Letters or definitive agreements
related to the Financing of which Parent becomes aware; (B) the receipt by
Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or written communication from the
Equity Investor or any Debt Financing Source with respect to any breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to a Commitment Letter or any
definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of any
Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements; (C) if for any reason, Parent
or Merger Sub at any time believes it will not be able to obtain all or any
portion of the Financing in an amount sufficient to consummate the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (D) any
fact, change, event or circumstance that would prevent or materially delay or
impede the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. In the event that all conditions
contained in the Commitment Letters (other than, with respect to the Debt
Financing, the availability of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied and
Parent is required to consummate the Closing pursuant to _Section 1.4_ ,
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Debt
Financing Source and shall cause the Equity Investor to fund its respective
committed portion of the Financing required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses on the
Closing Date.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall
not permit Merger Sub to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its rights,
provisions or remedies under, the Commitment Letters or Definitive Financing
Agreements without the Companys prior written consent; _provided_ , that
Parent and Merger Sub may, without the Companys prior written consent, (i)
enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or
waiver of any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements that would not, and would not reasonably be expected to,
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below an amount, together
with the Equity Financing and any available cash of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, required to pay the Merger Amounts, or prevent, materially delay
or impede the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter; and (ii) amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar entities that had not
executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof so long as any such
addition would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
impede the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, but only, with respect to the
foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , to the extent doing so would not (x)
impose new or additional conditions or expand, amend or modify any existing
condition to the receipt and availability of the Debt Financing in a manner
that would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede the
ability of Parent to consummate the Closing or (y) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub, as

 



-61- 

    

 applicable, to enforce its rights against the Debt Financing Sources under
the Debt Commitment Letter. Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement
or modification, the term "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Definitive Debt
Financing Agreement" shall mean the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt
Financing Agreement, as applicable, as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
modified. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such
amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Debt
Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreement.

 

(c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, or any
of the Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements shall
be withdrawn, repudiated, terminated or rescinded for any reason, then Parent
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) arrange and obtain from
the same or alternative financing sources, alternative financing in an amount
sufficient to, when added with the Equity Financing, available cash of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and the available portion of the Debt Financing,
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and pay the Merger
Consideration and the other Merger Amounts upon conditions not less favorable
to Parent and Merger Sub, than those in the Debt Commitment Letter or
Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and (ii) obtain one or more new financing
commitment letters with respect to such alternative financing (the " _New
Debt Commitment Letters_ "). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company
copies of any executed New Debt Commitment Letters. In the event any
alternative financing is obtained in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
5.13(c)_ (" _Alternative Financing_ "), references in this Agreement to the
Financing shall also be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing, and
references in this Agreement to the Commitment Letters and the Definitive
Debt Financing Agreements shall also be deemed to refer to any New Debt
Commitment Letters and definitive financing agreements relating to such
Alternative Financing, and all obligations of Parent pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_ shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as
Parents obligations with respect to the Financing.

 

(d) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to, provide such cooperation on a timely basis
(taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) as is
reasonably requested by Parent and the Debt Financing Sources to assist
Parent in obtaining the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described
in the Debt Commitment Letter. Such commercially reasonable cooperation shall
include the Company and its Subsidiaries using commercially reasonable efforts
to take the following actions (in each case, to the extent applicable with
respect to the Debt Financing):

 

(i) making appropriate officers, including officers with appropriate
seniority and expertise, available for participation at reasonable times in a
reasonable number of meetings, lender presentations, due diligence sessions,
meetings with prospective lenders and ratings agencies and road shows, in each
case in connection with the Debt Financing and only to the extent customarily
needed for financings of the type contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter;

 

(ii) providing reasonable assistance in the preparation of bank information
memoranda (including a bank information memorandum that does not include
material non-public information), rating agency presentations and any similar

 



-62- 

    

 documents, including the consent to the reasonable and customary use of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing
(and will, upon request of Parent, provide Parent with electronic versions of
such logos for such use);

(iii) assisting Parent in its negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of any definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested
by Parent or any Debt Financing Source (it being understood that such
documents will not take effect until the Closing), including guarantee,
pledge, security and collateral documents and providing Parent with any
information reasonably necessary to complete customary closing and perfection
certificates as may be required in connection with the Debt Financing
and other customary definitive financing documents or other customary
documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent;

 

(iv) facilitating the preparation, execution and delivery of documents and
other items needed to facilitate the creation and perfection of liens
securing the Debt Financing (it being understood that such documents will not
take effect until the Closing), including mortgages, original stock
certificates and original stock powers (or, if any, similar documents for
limited liability companies and foreign entities) in connection with the Debt
Financing (including providing copies thereof prior to the Closing Date) on or
prior to the Closing Date, assisting with the procurement of
insurance endorsements from the insurance policy underwriters of the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Closing Date, assisting with
Parents negotiation of deposit account control agreements with the financial
institutions with which the Company and any of its Subsidiaries maintain
securities and deposit accounts and taking reasonable actions necessary or
appropriate to permit Parent to evaluate the Companys and any of its
Subsidiaries assets and liabilities and contractual arrangements for
purposes of establishing guarantee and collateral arrangements;

(v) as promptly as reasonably practicable (A) furnishing Parent and the
Debt Financing Sources with the Required Information and (B) informing Parent
if to the Knowledge of the Company and or its Subsidiaries any facts that
would likely require the restatement of such financial statements for such
financial statements to comply with GAAP;

 

(vi) providing information required for Parent to prepare pro forma
financial information and projections required to be delivered pursuant to
the Debt Commitment Letter ( _provided_ , that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall have no obligation to prepare or provide any pro forma
financial statements or projections);

 

(vii) obtaining the Payoff Letters;

 

(viii) cooperating with due diligence and investigation of the Financing;

 

(ix) cooperating in satisfying the conditions precedent in the Debt

-63- 

    

(x) assisting the Parent in obtaining environmental assessments, surveys
and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent;

(xi) requesting its independent accountants to provide reasonable and
customary assistance and cooperation to Parent, including requesting their

in connection with the Debt Financing and reasonably cooperating with the
marketing efforts of Parent and Financing Sources;

 

(xiii) executing and delivering customary authorization letters with
respect to the Debt Financing from a senior officer of the Company;

prior to the Closing with respect to applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act,
and beneficial ownership rules;

 

(xv) periodically updating any Required Information provided to Parent as
may be necessary so that such Required Information (i) is Compliant, (ii)
meets the applicable requirements set forth in the definition of " _Required
Information_ " and (iii) would not, after giving effect to such update(s),
result in the Marketing Period no longer being deemed to have commenced. For
the avoidance of doubt, Parent may, to most effectively access the financing
markets, require the cooperation of the Company in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ and any of its Subsidiaries
under this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ at any time, and from time to time and on
multiple occasions, between the date hereof and the Closing; _provided_ , that
for the avoidance of doubt, the Marketing Period shall not be applicable as
to each attempt to access the markets;

 

(xvi) agreeing, notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or in
any other agreement between Parent and the Company (or its Affiliates) to the
contrary, that Parent may share customary projections with respect to the
Company and its business with the Debt Financing Sources, and that Parent and
such Debt Financing Sources may share such information with other potential
Debt Financing Sources in connection with any marketing efforts in connection
with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that the recipients of such information
and any other information contemplated to be provided by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries agree to customary confidentiality agreements, including
"click through" confidentiality agreements and confidentiality provisions
contained in customary bank books and offering memoranda; and

 

(xvii) at the reasonable request of the Parent, filing a Current Report on

 does not contain competitively sensitive information or information that is
validly protectable by assertion of the attorney-client privilege, which
Parent reasonably determines (in consultation with the Company) to include in
a customary bank information memorandum for the Debt Financing.

No obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their respective officers, directors, employees and agents or other
Representatives under any certificate, document or instrument delivered
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.13(d)_ (other than with respect
to customary authorization letters) shall be required to be effective until
the Effective Time. Upon reasonable request of the Company, the Company and
its legal counsel will be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon any bank information memorandum or similar documents, any rating agency
materials or any other materials which are being delivered to any Person not
affiliated with Parent or Merger Sub that are prepared in connection with the
Debt Financing after the date hereof, that include information about the
Company or its Subsidiaries. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.13_ to the contrary, in fulfilling its obligations pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.13_, (1) none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
its or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents or other
Representatives shall be required to (A) waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement, pay any commitment or other fee, provide any security or incur any
Liability or obligation in connection with the Debt Financing or any other
financing, in each case, prior to the Effective Time, (B) take or permit the
taking of any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with,
result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without lapse of
time, or both) under, the Company Organizational Documents or the
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company, or any applicable
Law or material Contracts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (C)
provide any cooperation that would unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (D) adopt resolutions
or consents or approve or authorize the execution of or enter into the Debt
Financing or the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements that are effective prior
to the Effective Time, (E) execute or approve any agreement, other Contract,
application, certification or instrument (other than customary authorization
letters, letters to rating agencies, filings with the SEC, documents in
connection with "know your customer", anti-money laundering and beneficial
ownership rules, and other Contracts, applications, certifications and
instruments customarily executed or approved by sellers and target companies
in connection with debt financings that are reasonably acceptable to the
Company) in connection with the Debt Financing (other than execution of such
documents by officers of the Company in their capacity as officers of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries), or (F) provide any information or
documentation which, in the opinion of the Company or its legal counsel,
would cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to lose or otherwise impair any
attorney client privilege with its legal counsel ( _provided_ , that the
Company shall inform Parent of the general nature of the information being
withheld and, upon Parents request, reasonably cooperate with Parent to
provide such information, in whole or in part, to the extent and in a manner
that would not result in any of the outcomes described in this _clause (F)_ )
and (2) Parent shall reimburse the Company promptly, upon written request by
the Company, for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with fulfilling its
obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ (including reasonable
attorneys fees and fees and expenses of accounting firms). No counsel for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (unless otherwise agreed in writing by the
Company and such counsel) shall be obligated to deliver any opinion in
connection with the Financing and, irrespective of the above, no obligation of
the 

 



-65- 

    

 Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any agreement, certificate,
document or instrument shall be effective until the Effective Time (other than
with respect to customary authorization letters). None of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action under any
certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument (other than with
respect to customary authorization letters) that is not contingent upon the
occurrence of the Closing or that would be effective prior to the Effective
Time. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ will require any Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion
or take any other action pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ that would
reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such Representative.
Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ to the contrary,
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries (and
their respective Representatives) from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by them
in connection with the Financing or any other financing (including the
arrangement thereof) and any information used in connection therewith (other
than information provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries in writing
specifically for inclusion in materials prepared in connection with the Debt
Financing), except in the event such loss or damage solely arises out of or
results from the Willful Breach, bad faith or gross negligence by the Company
or its Subsidiaries or, in each case, their respective Representatives, in
fulfilling their obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject
to the applicable terms of this Agreement and satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions to the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Offer
and the Merger), in no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or
financing (including the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters) by
or to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a
condition to any of Parents or Merger Subs obligations hereunder.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent may
enter discussions regarding, and may enter into arrangements and agreements
relating to the Financing to add other equity providers, so long as in respect
of any such arrangements and agreements, the following conditions are met: (i)
the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing is not reduced; (ii) the
arrangements and agreements, in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely
to delay or prevent the Offer Acceptance Time or the Closing; and (iii) the
arrangements and agreements would not diminish or release the pre-closing
obligations of the parties to the Equity Commitment Letter, adversely affect
the rights of the Company to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Equity Commitment Letter, or otherwise constitute a waiver or reduction
of Parents rights under the Equity Commitment Letter.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ shall require, and in no event shall
the commercially reasonable efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to
require, Parent or any Affiliate thereof to (i) seek Equity Financing from
any other source other than the financing source counterparty to, or in any
amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter or (ii)
pay any material fees in excess of those contemplated by the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Debt Commitment Letter.

Section 5.14 _Transaction Litigation_. Each party shall promptly (and in
any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the other parties hereto in
writing of any Proceedings brought or threatened in writing by any stockholder
of the Company or any other Person against it, its affiliates or its or their
directors or executive officers or other Representatives relating to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall keep the other parties hereto informed on a
reasonably current basis with respect to the status thereof (including by
promptly furnishing to the other parties hereto and their Representatives such
information relating to such Proceedings as may be reasonably requested). Each
party shall give the other parties hereto the opportunity to participate in
(but not control) the defense or settlement of any Proceeding against it, its
affiliates or its or their directors or officers or other Representatives
relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall give due consideration to such other
parties advice with respect to such Proceeding and the Company shall not
settle or agree to settle any such Proceeding without Parents prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
Without Parents prior written consent, the Company shall not (i) waive any
provision of the Company Organizational Documents providing for the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for any such
Proceeding or (ii) consent to the selection of an alternative forum other than
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for any such Proceeding. For
purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.14_, "participate" means that the non-
litigating party will be kept apprised by the litigating party of proposed
strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the stockholder
litigation or Proceedings contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ (to the
extent that the attorney-client privilege between the litigating party and its
counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected;  _provided_ , that the
litigating party shall inform the other party of the general nature of the
information being withheld and, upon such other partys request, reasonably
cooperate with such other party to provide such information, in whole or in
part, to the extent and in a manner that would not result in any of the
foregoing outcomes), and the non-litigating party may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to such stockholder litigation or Proceedings but
will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such
stockholder litigation or Proceedings.

 

Section 5.15 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall, and, following the Effective Time, Parent

necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and rules and
policies of the NYSE to cause the delisting of the Company and of the Shares
from the NYSE as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the
deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after such delisting.

Section 5.16 _Section 16 Matters; Rule 14d-10 Matters_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as
may be required to cause any dispositions of Shares (including derivative
securities with respect to Shares) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

(b) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Compensation Committee of the
Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") to the extent required will
take such steps to cause each employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement

 



-67- 

    

 pursuant to which consideration is payable to any officer, director or
employee who is a holder of any security of the Company to be approved by the
Compensation Committee in accordance with the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions thereto as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"

pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to a party if

would cause the applicable Offer Condition not to be satisfied;

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if an Order by a Governmental Entity

provided in the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of _Section_ __ _
5.4(c)_,  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_, _Section_ __ _ 5.13(d)_, this _Section_ __

same day funds to an account designated in writing by Parent (such written
instruction to be provided promptly after such payment becomes due and payable

-70- 

    

(ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by (x) Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ or (y) by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.1(e)(i)_, and (A) following the date hereof and prior to such

Company Board or shall have been publicly made directly to the Companys
stockholders generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known (and, in
each such case, such Acquisition Proposal shall not have been publicly
withdrawn prior to the time of termination) and (B) within twelve (12) months
after such termination, the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal which is ultimately
consummated or consummates an Acquisition Proposal (which need not be the same

shall thereby reduce, the amount of the Company Termination Fee that
otherwise would be required to be paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)(ii)_.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company
pursuant to (i) _ Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)(i)_, (ii) _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_ if
the Company would then be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

becomes due and payable under this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_).

(c) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)(i)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent
an amount equal to that required to reimburse Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby up to
five million dollars ($5,000,000) (the " _Parent Expenses_ ").

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, (x) " _Company Termination Fee_ "
means $19,850,000 unless this Agreement is terminated prior to the Cut-Off
Time by the Company pursuant to _______Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ or by Parent

Acquisition Proposal that is submitted prior to the Solicitation Period End
Time (other than by a Person or group that made, or engaged in any substantive
discussions with the Company or its Representatives regarding, an Acquisition
Proposal within the twelve (12) month period prior to the date of this
Agreement) or by an Excluded Party, in which case the " _Company Termination_

 



-71- 

    

  _Fee_ " means $13,235,000, and (y) " _Excluded Party_ " means any Person or
group of Persons from which the Company receives, after the execution of this
Agreement and at or prior to the Solicitation Period End Time, a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that remains pending as of, and has not been
withdrawn prior to, the earlier of the Solicitation Period End Time and the
valid termination of this Agreement;  _provided_ , that (1) the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys financial
advisors and outside legal counsel), not later than the Solicitation Period
End Time, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or
that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal, (2) the Company provides written notice to Parent of such
determination, including the identity of the applicable Excluded Party, no
later than twenty-four (24) hours after the Solicitation Period End Time, and
(3) such Person or group did not make, or engage in any substantive
discussions with the Company or its Representatives regarding, an
Acquisition Proposal within the twelve (12) month period prior to the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that a Person or group shall cease to
be an Excluded Party upon the earlier of (i) the withdrawal, termination,
expiration or abandonment of such Acquisition Proposal (as it may be amended
or modified) and (ii) the Cut-Off Time.

 

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) each of the Company
Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses is not intended to be a penalty but
rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent in the circumstances in which such fee and expenses are due and
payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (ii)
the Parent Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in
the circumstances in which such fee is due and payable, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion or shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more
than one occasion. Accordingly, if (x) the Company fails to timely pay
any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent commences a Proceeding that results in a judgment against
the Company for any amount due pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, then
the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such Proceeding not to exceed $500,000 (the " _Expense Cap_ ")
or (y) Parent fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 7.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a
Proceeding that results in a judgment against Parent for any amount due
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, then Parent shall pay the Company its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such Proceeding
not to exceed the Expense Cap, and, in each case of the foregoing _clauses
(x)_ and _(y)_ , together with interest on the amount due pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ from the date such payment was required to be made until
the date of payment at the annual rate of two percent (2%) plus the prime
lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made (or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or
any documents executed in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, but subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, the maximum
aggregate Liability, whether in equity or at Law, in Contract, in tort or
otherwise, together with any payment of the Parent Termination Fee and any

in lieu of specific performance) (i) under this Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Commitment Letters, any other document contemplated thereby or
any document or instrument delivered in connection hereunder or thereunder,
(ii) in connection with the failure of the Offer, the Merger (including the
Financing) or the other transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated or
(iii) in respect of any representation or warranty made or alleged to have
been made in connection with this Agreement or any documents executed in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, will
not exceed under any circumstances an amount equal to (x) the Parent
Termination Fee, if any, due and owing to the Company pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 7.3(b)_, plus (y) the amounts, if any, due and owing under _Section_ __ _
7.3(e)_, if any, plus (z) the amounts, if any, due and owing pursuant to
Parents indemnification obligations under _Section_ __ _ 5.13(d)_
(collectively, the " _Maximum Liability Amount_ "); _provided_ , that in no
event will the Company, its Affiliates or any of its Representatives seek,
directly or indirectly, to recover against the Parent Related Parties, or
compel payment by the Parent Related Parties of, any damages or other payments
whatsoever (including multiple, consequential, indirect, special, statutory,
exemplary or punitive damages) in excess of the Maximum Liability Amount set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3(f)_.

 

(g) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.

Contract or in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof,
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of

cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder,
or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this

and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the

jurisdiction and service contained in this

 



-74- 

    

  _Section_ __ _ 8.4_ is solely for the purpose referred to in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.4_ and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to
said courts or in the State of Delaware other than for such purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the parties hereto hereby
consents to the service of process in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.7_;
_provided_ , that nothing herein shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the parties hereto, nor
any of their respective Affiliates, will bring, or support the bringing of,
any Proceeding, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or tort or
otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, the
Commitment Letters or the performance thereof, anywhere other than the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable
Law jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District

Section 8.5 _Remedies_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that if any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy
at law would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and
accordingly, subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_, prior to any valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, (A)
each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to, and may seek in the
alternative, such remedies as are available at law and in equity, and (B) (i)
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to specific performance of the terms hereof, in
each case in the Chosen Court (in the order expressed in  _Section_ __ _
8.4(b)_), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity, (ii) the parties waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any
specific performance or injunctive relief and (iii) the parties will waive, in
any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at
law. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_, in circumstances where Parent and
Merger Sub are obligated to consummate the Offer or the Merger and the Offer
or the Merger has not been consummated, Parent and Merger Sub expressly
acknowledge and agree that the Company and its stockholders shall have
suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to
compensate the Company and its stockholders, and that the Company on behalf of
itself and its stockholders shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy
that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary
damages) to enforce specifically Parents and Merger Subs obligations to
consummate the Offer and the Merger. Any partys pursuit of specific
performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver
of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be
entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for Liabilities or damages
incurred or suffered by such party or its stockholders. In no event shall the
Company be entitled to receive (1) both a grant of specific performance to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the
Equity Commitment Letter) or other equitable relief, on the one hand, and the
payment of all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee or any amount
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)_, on the other hand or (2) both payment of
any monetary damages whatsoever, on the one hand, and payment of all or any
portion of the Parent Termination Fee or any amount pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.3(e)_, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, subject in all
respects to _Section_ __ _ 7.2_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, _Section_ __ _
8.5(b)_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.15_ (including, in each case, the limitations
set forth

 



-75- 

    

 therein), the parties hereto shall be entitled to seek the remedies provided
herein in the alternative, and not be required to elect their remedies, in any
Proceeding brought to seek redress for the failure of Parent to consummate
the Offer and the Merger pursuant to this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section_ __ _ 8.5(a)_ or anything in this Agreement
or otherwise to the contrary, and subject in all respects to this _Section_ __
_ 8.5(b)_, in no event shall the Company or any Affiliate or stockholder
thereof (or any of the foregoings respective Representatives) be entitled to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents or Merger Subs obligation to
cause all or any portion of the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under
this Agreement or the Equity Commitment Letter) or otherwise cause Parent or
Merger Sub to take action to consummate the Offer or the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby (including the obligation to pay all or any
portion of the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration) unless and only if:
(i) the Marketing Period has ended, (ii) with respect to the Offer and the
payment of the Offer Price and the Equity Financing related thereto, all of
the Offer Conditions have been and continue to be satisfied or waived (other
than those Offer Conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Expiration Time, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those Offer
Conditions at the Expiration Time (and for the avoidance of doubt after
giving effect to any extensions thereof in accordance with _Section_ __ _
1.1(d)_)), (iii) with respect to the Merger and the payment of the Merger
Consideration and the Equity Financing related thereto, all of the conditions
set forth in Section 6.1 have been and continue to be satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the
Closing), (iv) the Debt Financing has been (or will concurrently be) received
by Parent in full in accordance with the terms thereof, or the Debt Financing
Sources have irrevocably confirmed in writing to the parties hereto that the
Debt Financing will be funded in full at or before the Offer Acceptance Time
if the Equity Financing is funded at or before the Offer Acceptance Time (
_provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to draw down the
Equity Commitment Letter or consummate the Offer or the Closing if the Debt
Financing is not in fact funded at or before the Offer Acceptance Time), (v)
Parent and Merger Sub have failed to consummate (as defined in Section 251(h)
of the DGCL) the Offer by the date the Offer Acceptance Time is required to
have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.1_, (vi) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that (A) if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the
Closing will occur substantially simultaneously with the drawdown of the
Equity Financing and the Debt Financing (and the Company has not revoked,
withdrawn, modified or conditioned such confirmation) and (B) the Company is
ready, willing and able to effect the Closing and the other transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (vii)
Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Closing within three (3) Business
Days after delivery of the Companys irrevocable written confirmation;
_provided_ , that the Company remains ready, willing and able to consummate
the Closing during such three (3) Business Day period.
