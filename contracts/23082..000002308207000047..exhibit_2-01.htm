or waiver of all of the conditions  set forth  in Article VI, or at such

conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by  virtue  of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,  Company 
or the holders of any shares of capital stock of Company, the following 
shall  occur:

 

 

(a) _Company  Common Stock_.  Each  share of the Common Stock, no par
value, of Company (" **Company  Common Stock** ")  issued  and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any  shares  of Company
Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b)), together  with any
Rights associated therewith, will be canceled and extinguished  and 
automatically converted into the right to receive $34.00 in cash, without 
interest (the " **Merger  Consideration** ")  upon  surrender of the
certificate representing such share of Company Common  Stock in  the manner
provided in Section 1.7(c) (or in the case of a lost, stolen  or  destroyed
certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit and bond, if required,  in  the
manner provided in Section 1.9).  As of  the Effective Time, such shares of
Company Common Stock and any associated  Rights with respect thereto shall no
longer be outstanding and shall  automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of  a  certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any  such  shares of Company Common Stock (a "
**Certificate** ")  shall  cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive  the  Merger Consideration.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Cancellation  of Treasury and Parent Owned Stock_.  Each  share of
Company Common Stock held by Company or Parent or any direct or  indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Company or of Parent immediately prior  to  the
Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion 
thereof or the payment of any consideration therefor.

 

 

(c) _Capital  Stock of Merger Sub_.  Each  share of capital stock of Merger
Sub (the " **Merger  Sub Capital Stock** ")  issued  and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted  into  one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of capital stock  of the 
Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the 
shares  so converted.

 

 

(d) _Stock  Options_.  At the  Effective Time, all Company Options
outstanding under the Company Stock  Plans  shall be treated in accordance
with Section 5.8.

 

 

Section  1.7 _Surrender  of Certificates_.

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an
institution reasonably acceptable  to Company to act as the paying agent (the
" **Paying  Agent** "),  in  accordance with an agreement reasonably
satisfactory to Company, to receive  the  funds necessary to make the
payments contemplated by Section 1.6.

 

 

(b) _Parent  to Provide Merger Consideration_.  At or  prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause the Merger Sub  to  deposit
with the Paying Agent for payments in accordance with this Section  1.7, 
cash, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, in an amount 
sufficient to make payments of the Merger Consideration, pursuant to Section 
1.6  and such funds shall hereinafter be referred to as the " **Exchange 
Fund**." The  Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make
payments  out of  the Exchange Fund and the Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose  other  than to fund payments upon surrender of
Certificates. All  expenses of the Paying Agent shall be paid by the Parent
or Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

(c) _Exchange  Procedures_.  Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent
shall mail, or shall cause  the  Paying Agent to mail, to each holder of
record (as of the Effective Time)  of a  Certificate or Certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time  represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock that were converted  into  the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a):  (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be  effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only  upon  delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form  and  have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify); and  (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in  exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for  cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,  duly  completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto  and  such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent,  the 
holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor  by  check an amount in cash (after taking into account all
Certificates surrendered  by such holder) to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 1.6(a)  and  the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) _Transfers  of Ownership_.  If  payment of the Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than  a  Person in whose name in which the
Certificates surrendered in exchange  therefor  are registered, it will be a
condition of the payment thereof that the  Certificates so surrendered will
be properly endorsed and otherwise in  proper  form for transfer and that
the Person requesting such exchange will have  paid  any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person  other  than the
registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established  to  the
satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax  has
been  paid or is not payable.

 

 

(e) _Withholding_.  Each of  Parent, the Paying Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled  to  deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable  pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of Company Common  Stock such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom  under  the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " **Code** ")  or  under any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law or under any other  applicable Law. To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld,  the  amount of such
consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this  Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration  would  otherwise
have been paid.

 

 

(f) _Investment  of Exchange Fund_.  The  Paying Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed  by  Parent on a daily basis,
_provided_   that no  such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to Company  shareholders pursuant to this Section 1.7. To the
extent that there are  losses  with respect to such investments, Parent
shall promptly replace or restore  the  portion of the Exchange Fund lost
through investments so as to ensure that  the  Exchange Fund is maintained
at a level sufficient to make such payments.  Any  interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall become a  part of  the Exchange Fund,
and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to  Company  shareholders
pursuant to this Section 1.7 shall promptly be paid to  Parent.

 

 

(g) _Termination  of Exchange Fund_.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 1.7(g), neither  Parent,  Merger Sub, the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto  shall be liable to any
Person for any cash from the Exchange Fund properly  paid  to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat  or  similar
Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed  to the 
holders of Certificates one year after the Effective Time shall, at the 
request  of Parent, be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the instruction of
Parent,  and  any holders of the Certificates who have not surrendered such
Certificates  in  compliance with this Section 1.7(g) shall after such
delivery to Parent  look  only to Parent, and Parent shall thereafter be
liable, for the Merger  Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a), with
respect to the shares of  Company  Common Stock formerly represented
thereby.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  1.8 _No  Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All 
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of 
Company  Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have  been  paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company  Common Stock, including any Rights associated with such
Company Common  Stock.  After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers  on  the records of Company. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are  presented  to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, they shall be canceled and  exchanged as provided and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in  Section 1.7.

 

 

Section  1.9 _Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In  the  event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying  Agent
shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, 
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such 
Merger  Consideration as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6(a);
_provided,  however_ ,  that  Parent or the Paying Agent, may, in its
discretion, require the delivery  of a  suitable indemnity, as determined in
Parent's reasonable discretion. 

 

 

Section  1.10 _Warrants_. The  warrants to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock issued as of September  15,  2004 by Company to Fidelity Information
Services, Inc., an Arkansas Corporation  and CDR-COOKIE Acquisition, L.L.C.,
a Delaware limited liability company  (each,  a " **Warrant** ")  may be 
exercised prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms and 
conditions applicable to such Warrant and upon such exercise shall result  in
the  issuance of shares of Company Common Stock that shall be subject to
the  terms of  this Agreement. Each Warrant that is unexpired, unexercised

such Warrant, an amount in cash equal to (i) the product of the  Merger 
Consideration multiplied by the total number of shares of Company Common 
Stock  subject to the Warrant designated in such Subscription Notice, minus
(ii)  the  aggregate Exercise Price with respect to all shares of Company
Common Stock  subject to the Warrant designated in such Subscription Notice.

 

 

Section  1.11 _Further  Action_.  At and  after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of Parent and the  Surviving  Corporation will be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and  on behalf  of Company
and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances  and to

and under  any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired
by the  Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the 
Merger.

**ARTICLE  II**

 

**REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY**

 

 

Except  as  disclosed in the correspondingly numbered section of the
disclosure letter  dated  the date of this Agreement and delivered by
Company to Parent immediately  prior  to the execution of this Agreement
(the " **Company  Disclosure Letter** "),  that  specifically relates to
such section or in another section of the Company  Disclosure Letter to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent from the  text of  such disclosure
that such disclosure is applicable to such section, Company  hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

 

Section  2.1 _Organization;  Standing and Power; Charter Documents;
Subsidiaries_. 

 

 

(a) _Organization;  Standing and Power_.  Company  and each of its
Subsidiaries is a corporation or other organization duly  organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the  jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization (to the extent the "good  standing" concept is
applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside of the  United States).
Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has the requisite  corporate  power and
authority to own, lease and operate its respective properties  and to  carry
on its business as now being conducted. Each of Company and its  Subsidiaries
is duly qualified to do business and in good standing in each  jurisdiction
in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing  of  its
properties makes such qualification necessary (to the extent the "good 
standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside of
the  United States) other than where the failure to so qualify or to be in
good  standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material  Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " **Subsidiary**
," when  used with respect to any party, shall mean any corporation or
other  organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, at least a
majority  of the  securities or other interests of which having by their
terms ordinary voting  power to elect a majority of the Board of Directors or
others performing  similar  functions with respect to such corporation or
other organization is directly  or  indirectly owned or controlled by such
party or by any one or more of its  subsidiaries, or by such party and one or
more of its subsidiaries (it  being  understood that, for purposes of this
Agreement, Fortune shall be deemed  to be a  Subsidiary of Company).

 

 

(b) _Charter  Documents_.  Company  has delivered or made available to
Parent: (i) a true and correct copy of  the Restated Articles of
Incorporation (including any Certificate of  Designations) and Bylaws of
Company, each as amended to date (collectively,  the " **Company  Charter
Documents** ")  and  (ii) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or
like organizational  documents, each as amended to date (collectively, the "
**Subsidiary  Charter Documents** "),  of  each of its Subsidiaries, and
each such instrument is in full force and  effect.  Company is not in
violation of any of the provisions of the Company Charter  Documents. No
Subsidiary is in violation of any of its applicable Subsidiary  Charter
Documents, except where such violations that would not, individually  or  in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(c) _Subsidiaries_.  Section  2.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists
all of the Subsidiaries of  Company. All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity  or  voting interests in, each such Subsidiary
have been validly issued, were  issued  free of preemptive rights, and are
fully paid and nonassessable and are  owned  directly or indirectly by
Company, free and clear of all pledges, liens,  mortgages, encumbrances and
security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever  (collectively, "
**Liens** "),  including **** any  restriction on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise dispose of such capital  stock or other ownership interests, except
for restrictions imposed by  applicable securities Laws.  Except  for the
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, its  Subsidiaries,
Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital  stock  of, or
other equity or voting interests in, any corporation, partnership,  joint 
venture, association, limited liability company or other entity, other 
than  ordinary course investments in investment securities.

(ii) 1,000,000 shares of  preferred stock, no par value (the " **Company 
Preferred Stock** "),  of  which 200,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock
are designated as Series  A  Voting Convertible Preferred Stock and 37,620
shares of Company Preferred  Stock  are designated as Series B Participating

**Capitalization  Date** "):  (i) 36,492,526 shares of Company Common Stock
were issued and outstanding,  (ii) 9,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock
were subject to issuance  pursuant to the Warrants, and (iii) no shares of
Company Preferred Stock  were issued and outstanding; provided that 37,620
Junior Preference Shares  have  been reserved for issuance in connection

of such Warrant, (2) the number and class of  shares  of Company capital
stock subject to such Warrant, (3) the exercise price  of such  Warrant and
(4) the date on which such Warrant expires. All of the outstanding  shares of

be, when issued, duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and 
nonassessable and not subject to any preemptive rights. Dissenters'  rights
are not available pursuant to Section 762 of the MBCA with respect  to 
shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement.

 

 

(b) _Options_.  (i)  As of  the close of business on the Capitalization

the Covansys Corporation 1996 Stock Option Plan, as amended,  and  the
Covansys Corporation 2007 Stock Option Plan (collectively, the " **Company 
Stock Plans** ").  All  shares of Company Common Stock subject to issuance
under the Company Stock  Plans  upon issuance in accordance with the terms
and conditions specified in  the  instruments pursuant to which they are
issuable, would be duly authorized,  validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable. Section 2.2(b)(i) of the  Company  Disclosure Letter sets
forth each Company Option outstanding as of the  Capitalization Date, the
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable  thereunder or related
thereto, the expiration date and the exercise price  thereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) There  are  no outstanding or authorized stock appreciation rights,
phantom stock,  profit  participation, rights to purchase or acquire Company
Preferred Stock or  other  similar rights with respect to Company, other
than in respect of the Junior  Preference Shares.  Other  than the Company

stock,  voting securities or other ownership interests in) Company, (iii)
obligations  of  Company or any of its Subsidiaries to grant, extend or

Debt, capital stock,  voting securities or other ownership interests in
Company (the items in  clauses  (i), (ii) and (iii), together with the
capital stock of Company, being  referred  to collectively as " **Company 
Securities** ").  All  outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, all
outstanding Warrants, all  outstanding Company Options, and all outstanding
shares of capital stock  of each  Subsidiary of Company have been issued and
granted in compliance in all  material  respects with all requirements set
forth in applicable Contracts.

 

 

(iii) There  are  no outstanding Contracts requiring Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to  (A) repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company
Securities or  Subsidiary Securities or (B) dispose of any Subsidiary
Securities. Other  than as set forth in Section 2.2(b)(iii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter,  Company is not a party to any voting agreement with
respect to any Company  Securities or Subsidiary Securities.

 

 

(iv) To  the  knowledge of Company, all Company Options have an exercise
price equal  to no  less than the fair market value of the underlying shares
of Company Common  Stock  on the accounting measurement date, except where
such violations would  not,  individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.  To the  knowledge of Company, all Company
Options granted after December 31, 2004,  were  granted with respect to a
class of stock of Company that is "service recipient  stock" (within the
meaning of applicable regulations under Code Section 409A).

the value of which is any way based  upon or derived from capital stock or
voting securities of Company or any  of its  Subsidiaries, is issued or

adjustment has occurred to  the  Exercise Price (as defined, respectively,
in each of the Warrants) or the  number  of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Warrants, and (ii) there  has been no Change that requires any
such adjustment.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries  convertible into or exchangeable for
shares of Voting Debt, capital stock,  voting securities or other ownership
interests in any Subsidiary of Company,  (ii) options, restricted stock,
warrants, rights or other agreements or  commitments to acquire from Company

interests in) any Subsidiary of Company, (iii) obligations of Company or  any
of  its Subsidiaries to grant, extend or enter into any subscription,

Merger  pursuant to the MBCA. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Company  and the consummation by Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby  have  been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of Company  and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Company
are necessary  by  Company to authorize the execution and delivery of this

Company and, assuming due authorization,  execution and delivery by Parent
and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid  and  binding obligation of
Company, enforceable against Company in accordance  with  its terms except
that such enforceability (a) may be limited by applicable  bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws  affecting or
relating to creditors' rights generally and (b) is subject to  general
principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding at law  or in 
equity. The making of any offer or proposal, or indication of interest  in
making  an offer or proposal, and the taking of any other action by Parent or
Merger  Sub  in accordance with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby  have  been consented to by the Board of Directors of
Company under provisions  of the  confidentiality agreement, dated April 9,
2007, between Parent and Company  (the " **Confidentiality  Agreement** ").

 

 

(b) _Company  Board Recommendation_.  The  Board of Directors of Company,
by resolutions duly adopted at a meeting  of all  directors duly called and

the Merger to be advisable, (ii)  approved the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and  the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with  the MBCA  upon the terms and
conditions contained herein and adopted the plan of  merger  contained in

of Company Common Stock approve this Agreement and the plan of merger 
contained herein in accordance with the applicable provisions of the MBCA

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  including the acquisition
of Company and shares of the capital stock of  Company  by Parent and Parent
becoming an "interested shareholder", for purposes of  Section 782 of the
MBCA, and such approval is sufficient to render inapplicable  to the

MBCA. Such resolutions and approvals have not been subsequently rescinded, 
modified or withdrawn in any way.

 

 

(e) _Rights  Plan_.  Company  has taken all necessary action, including

registration, declaration  or  filing (any of the foregoing being a "
**Consent** ")  with  any federal, state or foreign government, any

and other documents  (including exhibits and all other information
incorporated by reference)  required to be so filed or furnished by it since

available to Parent all such Company SEC Documents (except  to  the extent
such Company SEC Documents are publicly available in the Electronic  Data
Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) database of the SEC). As  of
their  respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent
filing,  as  of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing
prior to the  date  hereof), each of the Company SEC Documents complied as
to conform in all  material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act  of  1933, as amended (the " **Securities  Act** "),  the 
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " **Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act** "),  as  applicable, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder applicable  to  such Company SEC Documents. None of the Company
SEC Documents, including  any  financial statements, schedules or exhibits
included or incorporated by  reference therein at the time they were filed
(or, if amended or superseded  by a  subsequent filing, as of the date of
the last such amendment or superseding  filing prior to the date hereof)
contained any untrue statement of a material  fact or omitted to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the  statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they  were  made, not misleading.
None of Company's Subsidiaries is required to file any  forms, reports or
other documents with the SEC.

 

 

(b) _Financial  Statements_.  Each of  the consolidated financial

Company and its consolidated  Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof
and the consolidated results  of  Company's operations, shareholders' equity
and cash flows for the periods  indicated; _provided_ ,  that  unaudited
interim financial statements may not contain footnotes required  by  GAAP to
be included in audited financial statements and are subject to  normal 
year-end audit adjustments which are not, individually or in the aggregate,

of internal controls over financial  reporting that are sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding  the  reliability of financial reporting and

with GAAP, including policies and procedures  that provide reasonable
assurance that (i) transactions are executed only  in  accordance with
authorizations of management and directors and (ii) transactions  are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements  in 
accordance with GAAP. Company has implemented and maintains disclosure 
controls  and procedures sufficient to ensure that information required to be
disclosed  by  Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded,  processed, summarized and reported within the time frames
specified by  the SEC's  rules and forms. None of Company or its
Subsidiaries has been made aware  of (A)  any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation  of Company's internal
controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule  13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act), which would, individually or in the  aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or (B) any fraud, whether  or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a  significant role in
Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

Subsidiaries has any liabilities (absolute,  accrued, contingent, or
otherwise) of the type required to be disclosed  by GAAP  on the Company
Balance Sheet (or reflected in the footnotes thereto) that  would, 
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material  to 
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than (a) liabilities  as
and  to the extent reflected or reserved against on the Company Balance
Sheet  and  (b) liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet
Date in  the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

 

 

(e) _Off-Balance  Sheet Arrangements_.  Neither  Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment  to  become a party to,
any joint venture, partnership agreement or any similar  Contract (including

between or among Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the  one  hand, and
any unconsolidated affiliate or other entity, including any structured 
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other 
hand)  the purpose or effect of which is to avoid disclosure of any

consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby will not (either alone
or upon the occurrence of an  individual's termination of employment within
one year prior to or three years  following the transactions contemplated

Employee Agreement, trust or loan that will  or  may result in any payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,  forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits  or  obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any Company Employee.  None  of the Company
Employee Agreements or Company Employee Plans have a provision  providing for
a tax gross-up for taxes incurred under Section 4999 of the  Code. 

 

 

(h) _Employment  Law Matters_.  Company  and each of its Company ERISA

normal  course  of business and consistent with past practice). There are no
material  Proceedings pending against Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate
under  any  worker\'s compensation policy or long-term disability policy.

Organization, to organize any Company Employees. There are no Proceedings, 
labor  disputes or grievances pending, or, to the knowledge of Company,
threatened  or  reasonably anticipated relating to any labor, safety or
discrimination  matters  involving any Company Employee, including charges
of unfair labor practices  or  discrimination complaints, which, if
adversely determined, would, individually  or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither Company  nor  any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair labor practices within  the  meaning
of the National Labor Relations Act. Neither Company nor any Company  ERISA
Affiliate is presently, or has been in the past, a party to, or bound  by, 
any collective bargaining agreement, union contract or similar agreement 
with  respect to Company Employees and no collective bargaining agreement
is  being  negotiated with respect to Company Employees. Neither Company nor

Section  5.3 _Acquisition  Proposals_. 

 

 

(a) _No  Solicitation_.  Subject  to the provisions of this Section 5.3,
Company agrees that neither it nor  any of  its Subsidiaries nor any of the
officers, directors, employees, agents  and  representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant)  (collectively, "
**Representatives** ")  of it  or its Subsidiaries shall, directly or
indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate,  or knowingly take any action to
facilitate the making, submission or  announcement of, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) engage in any discussions  or negotiations (other than to
state that they are not permitted to have  discussions) regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) terminate, amend,  or  waive any rights under
any "standstill" or other similar agreement between  Company or any of its

thereby or (B) allow the Rights to expire prior to their expiration  date
(except as otherwise contemplated in connection with the Merger),  except
in  the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to the extent expressly permitted by 
this  Agreement. Company and each of its Subsidiaries and each of its and
their  respective Representatives will each immediately cease any and all
existing  activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties
conducted  heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.  Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any
violation  of  the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.3(a) by any
Subsidiary of  Company  or any Representative of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed  to  be a breach of this Section 5.3(a) by
Company." **Acceptable  Confidentiality Agreement** " means  a

the  third party as the terms contained in the Confidentiality  Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

35  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) _Notification  of Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals_.  As  promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within two days) after  receipt of
any Acquisition Proposal, Company shall provide Parent with  written  notice
of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal,  request
or inquiry; the identity of the Person or Persons making any such 
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry; and a copy of all written
materials  provided in connection with such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry.  Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis of
the  status  and details of any such Acquisition Proposal or request, and
shall promptly  (and  in any event within two days) provide to Parent a copy
of all written materials  subsequently provided to or by Company in
connection with such Acquisition  Proposal or request.

 

 

(c) _Superior  Offers_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in Section 5.3(a), in  the event that after the date hereof and prior to
obtaining the Requisite  Shareholder Approval, (1) Company receives an
unsolicited, _bona  fide_ written  Acquisition Proposal from a third party
that did not result from a breach  of  this Section 5.3 and (2) its Board of
Directors or a committee thereof  determines in good faith (following
consultation with its Representatives)  that  such Acquisition Proposal is,
or is reasonably likely to constitute, a  Superior  Offer, then Company, its
Board of Directors or a committee thereof may  directly  or indirectly
through advisors, agents, other intermediaries or representatives,  take the
following actions:

 

 

(i) furnish  non-public information to the third party making such
Acquisition Proposal  ( _provided_   that (A)  Company enters into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the third  party  prior to
furnishing any non-public information, and (B) substantially  concurrently
with furnishing such information to such third party, Company  furnishes
copies of such information to Parent, to the extent not previously  provided
to Parent); and

 

 

(ii) engage  in  discussions and negotiations (including exchanging draft
agreements) with  the  third party (and its Representatives) with respect to
the Acquisition  Proposal.

 

 

(d) _Changes  of Recommendation_.  Except  as expressly permitted in this
Section 5.3(d), the Board of Directors of  Company  (or any committee
thereof) shall not: (A) withdraw, or modify or change  in any  manner
adverse to Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation; (B) approve,  adopt
or recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or (C) approve or recommend,  or 
allow Company or any Subsidiary to enter into, any letter of intent,
acquisition  agreement or other similar agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal  (any of the foregoing a " **Change  of
Recommendation** ").  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 5.2 or this  Section 5.3, in response to an unsolicited, _bona 
fide_   written  Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof and prior to
obtaining the Requisite  Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of
Company, or any committee  thereof, may effect a Change of Recommendation and
terminate this Agreement  to  enter into a definitive agreement effectuating
the Superior Offer described  below, if, and only if, all of the following
conditions set forth in clauses  (i)  through (v) are satisfied:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) the  Board  of Directors of Company, or any committee thereof, shall
have determined  in good  faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors  of  Company, its Board of Directors or any
committee thereof) that such Acquisition  Proposal constitutes a Superior
Offer (after giving effect to all of the  adjustments to the terms of this
Agreement which may be offered by Parent  including pursuant to clause (iii)
below);

 

 

(ii) Company  (A) shall deliver to Parent written notice (a " **Change  of
Recommendation Notice** ")  of its  intention to take such action, at least
three business days (the " **Notice  Period** ")  in  advance, specifying
in such notice the material terms and conditions of  such  Superior Offer
(including the identity of the party making the Superior  Offer);  and (B)
in the event of any material revisions to the Superior Offer after  the start
of the Notice Period, shall promptly deliver a new Change of  Recommendation
Notice to Parent and comply with the requirements of this  clause  (ii) with
respect to such new notice;

provide Parent  with an opportunity to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions  of this  Agreement during such three business day period, and
negotiate with respect  thereto during such three business day period;

 

 

(iv) Company's  Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, shall have
determined, after  consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisors of Company,  its  Board of Directors or any committee thereof, in
good faith, that the failure  of  the Board of Directors to effect a Change
of Recommendation or to terminate  this  Agreement would reasonably be
expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary  obligations to the
shareholders of Company under applicable Law;  and

 

 

(v) Company  shall not have breached any of the provisions set forth in
Section 5.2  or this  Section 5.3.

 

 

(e) _Compliance  with Tender Offer Rules_.  Nothing  contained in this

contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A and Rules 14d-9 and  14e-2(a),
each as promulgated under the Exchange Act. Nothing contained  in this 
Section 5.3(e) shall be interpreted to affect or otherwise qualify, limit

Exchange Act) that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would 
result in  such Person or "group" beneficially owning more than 25% of any
class or series  of capital stock of Company outstanding as of the
consummation of such  acquisition or tender or exchange offer; (ii) a merger,
consolidation,  business  combination or other transaction involving Company

regulatory and other aspects  of  the offer and (Y) the business, legal and
financial condition of the Person  making the offer, more favorable to

Subsidiaries.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Nothing  in this Section 5.4 shall require Company to disclose any
information that,  in  the reasonable judgment of Company, would violate any
of its contractual  obligations to any third party with respect to
confidentiality, _provided_   that  Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent  of  such third party to such
disclosure. Information obtained by Parent or  Merger  Sub pursuant to
Section 5.4, Section 5.6 and Section 5.7 shall be subject  to the 
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, and the Confidentiality
Agreement  will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms (except  as  provided in Section 8.5).

Laws, Parent and Company, or their respective counsel, shall consult with 
the  other on the strategy for dealing with the Federal Trade Commission,

this Agreement, use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that  the

Section  5.7 _Notification_ _  of  Certain Matters_. 

 

 

(a) _By  Company_.  Company  shall give written notice to Parent and Merger
Sub, promptly upon obtaining  knowledge thereof, of the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event that  is  likely (i) to result in a condition to the

any covenant, condition or agreement to  be  complied with or satisfied by

Section  5.8 _Equity  Awards and Employee Benefits_.

 

 

(a) Upon  the  terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the  Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, each Company
Option shall be either  exercised by the option holder or canceled and

in cash from the Surviving  Corporation equal to the positive product
obtained by multiplying (x) the  aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were issuable upon  exercise of such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time  and (y)  the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per share exercise  price of such Company Option (the
" **Option  Consideration** ").  Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay to holders  of  outstanding and unexercised (as of the
time immediately prior to the Effective  Time) Company Options the Option

Company immediately prior to the Effective  Time.

 

 

(i) With  respect to any officer or employee of Company who is covered by a

maintained Company\'s  standard severance policy as in effect as of the date
hereof for a period  of at  least 12 months from the Effective Time.

 

 

(ii) Parent  shall honor or cause to be honored all severance agreements and

(c) Subject  to Section 5.8(b) above, Continuing Employees shall be eligible
to receive  benefits consistent with Parent's applicable human resources
policies. Each  Continuing Employee shall receive credit for prior service

Parent shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) apply  prior 
period(s) of health insurance coverage towards satisfaction of Parent's  pre-
existing condition limitations upon submission of Certificate(s) of 
Creditable Coverage, as permitted under the Health Insurance Portability 
and  Accountability Act (" **HIPAA** "),  (ii)  provide credit to each such
employee for any co-payments and deductibles  under  Parent's Preferred
Access medical plan where paid by the employee prior to the  change in
coverage for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs,  and (iii) 
apply immediate prior period participation in Company's short-term
disability  and long-term disability plans toward satisfaction of pre-
existing conditions  limitations under Parent's short-term disability and
long-term disability plans. 

 

 

(d) Effective  as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, (i) each
of Company  and  any Company ERISA Affiliate shall terminate Company
Employee Plans that  includes  a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (a "

and approved by Parent (such  approval not to be unreasonably withheld) and
(ii) Company shall provide  Parent  with evidence that such Terminating
Plan(s) have been terminated before  the  Closing Date, and shall take such
other actions in furtherance of terminating  such Terminating Plan(s) as

Compensation Plan (the  " **Deferred  Compensation Plan** ")  pursuant to
resolutions of the Company Board of Directors. Company shall  provide 
Parent with evidence that the Deferred Compensation Plan has been terminated 
before the Effective Time, and shall take such other actions in furtherance 
of  terminating the Deferred Compensation Plan as Parent may reasonably 
require.

 

 

(f) This  Section 5.8 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each  of the  parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.8,
express or  implied,  is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies of any  nature  whatsoever under or by reason of this Section

will create any third party beneficiary rights  in  any current or former
employee, director or consultant of the Company or  its  Subsidiaries in
respect of continued employment (or resumed employment)  or any  other
matter. Nothing  in this Section 5.8 is intended to amend any Company
Employee Plan, or  interfere  with Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's
right from and after the Effective  Time to amend or terminate any Company
Employee Plan or the employment  or  provision of services by any director,
employee, independent contractor  or  consultant.

 

 

Section  5.9 _Indemnification_ _;  Insurance_.

all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, 
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in
connection  with any Proceeding (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time),  whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of  or  pertaining to any action or omission in their capacity
as an officer, director,  fiduciary or agent of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, occurring on  or before  the Effective Time, to the same
extent as provided in the Company Charter  Documents as of the date hereof.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) For  a  period of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation  shall  maintain in effect Company's current directors' and
officers' liability  insurance (" **D andO  Insurance**")  in  respect of
acts or omissions occurring on or before the Effective Time,  on terms  and
conditions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than those  of the 
DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement (which Company 
represents and warrants are set forth in Section 5.9(c) of the Company 
Disclosure Letter); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in  satisfying its
obligations under this Section 5.9(c), the Surviving Corporation  shall not
be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of 400% of the  amount  paid
by Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year; _provided_ , 
_however_ ,  that,  if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained or can be
obtained only by paying  aggregate premiums in excess of 400% of such amount,
the Surviving Corporation  shall only be required to maintain as much
coverage as can be obtained  by paying  aggregate premiums equal to 400% of
such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing  and in lieu of all obligations of
the Surviving Corporation under the first  sentence of this Section 5.9(c),
Parent or, at Parent's written direction,  Company, may purchase a "tail"
policy of directors and officers liability  insurance covering a period of
six years after the Effective Time, which  policy  (i) shall be on terms and
conditions no less favorable to the Indemnified  Parties than those of the
DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this  Agreement and be written by a
carrier with the same or better rating as  the  carrier of the DandO Insurance
as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) shall be  prepaid and non-cancelable,
and (iii) shall have aggregate premiums not  in  excess of 400% of the
aggregate annual amounts paid by Company for coverage  for  its last full
fiscal year; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that,  if equivalent coverage
cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying  aggregate premiums in
excess of 400% of such amount, Parent or Company  shall  obtain (and the
Surviving Corporation shall only be required to maintain)  as  much coverage
as can be obtained by paying aggregate premiums equal to  400% of  such
amount.

 

 

(d) This  Section 5.9 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable  by  the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and  shall  be binding on Parent and the Surviving
Corporation and their respective  successors and assigns, and shall be in
addition to, and not in substitution  for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such  Person  may have by contract
or otherwise. On and after the Effective Time, the  obligations of Parent
under Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or modified  in  such a manner as
to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party  under  Section 5.9
without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. In  the event 
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i)
consolidates  with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or  surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii)  transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any  Person,  then, and in each case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successor  and  assign of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, honor  the  obligations set forth with
respect to Parent or the Surviving Corporation,  as  the case may be, in
this Section 5.9.

 

 

Section  5.10 _Section 16  Matters_.  Prior  to the Effective Time,
Company shall take all such steps as may be required  (to  the extent
permitted under applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of  Company

Stock) or acquisitions of derivative securities with respect to Parent 
Common  Stock resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article I and
Section  5.8  of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting  requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Company  to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Agreement.

 

 

Section  5.12 _Conveyance  Taxes_.  Parent,  Merger Sub and Company shall
cooperate in the preparation, execution and  filing  of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding  any  real
property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock
