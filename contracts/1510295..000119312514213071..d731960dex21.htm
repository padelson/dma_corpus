PURCHASE AND SALE

 



20 Section 2.1 _Purchase and Sale_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, or cause to be sold, assigned,
transferred, conveyed and delivered to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and
acquire, all of the Acquired Company Interest (the "Sale;" _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the term "Sale" include any of the
transactions contemplated by _Section 5.6(a)_ or _Section 5.6(b)_).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at Sellers
option, rather than causing Hess Wilco Holdings, Inc. to contribute all of the
Equity Interests in Hess Wilco Holdings, LLC (and hence the WilcoHess 56%
Equity Interests) to the Acquired Company prior to the Closing, Seller may
cause Hess Wilco Holdings, Inc. to, at the Closing, separately assign,
transfer, convey and deliver all of the Equity Interests in Hess Wilco
Holdings, LLC (and hence the WilcoHess 56% Equity Interests) to Buyer, or at
Buyers option, to one of its Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, in the
event that Seller separately assigns, transfers, conveys and delivers all the
Equity Interests in Hess Wilco Holdings, LLC, such separate
assignment, transfer, conveyance and delivery shall be deemed to be part of
the "Sale" for all purposes of this Agreement. In addition, if requested by
Buyer in writing as soon as practicable after the date hereof but in any event
no later than 30 days following the date hereof, Seller will cause the
conveyance at the Closing of any Acquired Asset relating specifically to
Sellers branded retailer or dealer business to be made separately to Buyer or
an Affiliates of Buyer as Buyer may direct, and any such separate conveyance
shall be deemed part of the "Sale" for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.2 _Consideration_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer shall (on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates), in consideration for the purchase of the Acquired Company
Interest and, if elected by Seller, the separate assignment, transfer,
conveyance and delivery of all of the Equity Interests in Hess Wilco Holdings,
LLC pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and, if requested by Buyer, the separate
conveyance of certain Acquired Assets pursuant to _Section 2.1_, pay to
Seller the Initial Purchase Price determined in accordance with  _Section
2.4(a)_. The Initial Purchase Price is subject to further adjustment following
the Closing in accordance with _Section 2.4_.

 

Section 2.3 _Closing_.

 

(a) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall be held at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, located at
601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, at 10:00 a.m., New York City time,
no later than the fifth Business Day following the date on which the
conditions to the Closing set forth in  _Section 6.1_, _Section 6.2_ and
_Section 6.3_ (other than conditions which by their nature can be satisfied
only at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof) are
satisfied or, if permissible, waived (the "Closing Date"), unless another
date is agreed to in writing by Buyer and Seller; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Buyer shall not be obligated to close the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement prior to 120 days from signing. Except to the extent expressly
set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, and notwithstanding the actual
occurrence of the Closing at any particular time on the Closing Date, the
Closing shall be deemed to have occurred and be effective as of 12:01 a.m.
(New York City time) on the Closing Date (the "Effective Time").

this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered, to Buyer, the following: __

such Ancillary Agreements, and the transactions contemplated herein and

Agreements, and the transactions contemplated herein and therein, and that
such resolutions and/or consents have not been modified or rescinded as of
the Closing Date; and

(v) all other documents required to be delivered by Buyer on or prior to
the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Determination of Initial Purchase Price_.

 

(i) No later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer a certificate setting forth Sellers good faith
estimate of the Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time, prepared in
conformity with the requirements of this Agreement (the "Estimated Net Working
Capital").

 

(ii) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount (such amount, the
"Initial Purchase Price") in cash equal to the Base Price, (A) plus, if the
Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Reference Net Working Capital by
more than the Adjustment Threshold, then an amount equal to the full amount of
such excess, (B) minus, if the Reference Net Working Capital exceeds the
Estimated Net Working Capital by more than the Adjustment Threshold, then an
amount equal to the full amount of such excess, (C) minus, if applicable, the
Casualty Loss Adjustment Amount, (D) plus, if applicable, the Leveraged Lease
Adjustment Amount, and (E) minus, if applicable, the ROFR Adjustment Amount.

(b)  _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_. Within 90 days following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a detailed calculation (the
"Preliminary Adjustment Statement") of Net Working Capital as of the Effective
Time, prepared in conformity with the requirements of this Agreement and in a
format consistent with _Exhibit C_ (the "Closing Net Working Capital").

 

(c) Seller shall have 45 Business Days (the "Review Period") following receipt
of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement to review the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement and to notify Buyer in writing if it disputes any of the items set
forth on the Preliminary Adjustment Statement (the "Disagreement Notice"). In
connection with Sellers review of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement,
Seller and its Representatives shall have reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice, to all relevant work papers,
schedules, and other supporting documents prepared by Buyer or its
Representatives and used in connection with its calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital and to finance personnel and accountants of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries and any other information which Seller  

 



23  reasonably requests, and Buyer shall, and shall cause its Representatives
to, cooperate reasonably with Seller and its Representatives in connection
therewith.

 

(d) In the event that Seller shall deliver a Disagreement Notice to Buyer,
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as
promptly as practicable and, upon such resolution, if any, any adjustments to
the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and/or the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital shall be made in writing in accordance with the agreement
of Buyer and Seller. If Seller does not deliver a Disagreement Notice to
Buyer before the expiration of the Review Period, effective as of 12:01 a.m.,
New York City Time, on the day immediately following the last day of the
Review Period, the Closing Net Working Capital as shown in the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement shall become final, conclusive and binding on the parties
hereto and shall constitute the "Final Net Working Capital" for purposes of
_Section 2.4(h)_ and _Section 2.4(j)_.

(e) If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any such dispute within 20
Business Days or such longer period as Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree
in writing after Sellers delivery of the Disagreement Notice (the "Resolution
Period"), such dispute shall be promptly submitted to a mutually acceptable
nationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants that
has not provided material services to either Seller or Buyer or their
respective Affiliates in the preceding three years, or if no such firm is
available and willing to serve, then a mutually acceptable expert in public
accounting, in each case, upon which Buyer and Seller shall have mutually
agreed (the "Independent Accounting Firm"). If the parties are unable to agree
on the Independent Accounting Firm within 15 days following the expiration of
the Resolution Period, either party may request the President of the American
Arbitration Association to appoint a senior partner in a nationally recognized
accounting firm to serve as the Independent Accounting Firm.

(f) If any remaining items in dispute (the "Unresolved Items") are submitted
to the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution, each of Buyer and Seller
shall submit to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the
other party on the same day), within 10 Business Days after the date of the
engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum (which may
include supporting exhibits) setting forth their respective positions on the
Unresolved Items. Each of Buyer and Seller may (but shall not be required to)
submit to the Independent Accounting Firm (with a copy delivered to the other
party on the same day), within 20 Business Days after the date of the
engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm, a memorandum responding to the
initial memorandum submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm by the other
party. Unless requested by the Independent Accounting Firm in writing, no
party hereto may present any additional information or arguments to the
Independent Accounting Firm, either orally or in writing. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall be given reasonable access to all relevant records of
the Business to calculate the Closing Net Working Capital.

(g) The Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator to calculate, based solely on the written submissions of Buyer, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, and not by independent
investigation, the Closing Net Working Capital and shall be instructed that
its calculation (i) must be made in accordance with the requirements of this
Agreement, and (ii) with respect to each item in dispute, must be within the
range of 

 



24  values established for such amount as determined by reference to the value
assigned to such amount by Seller in the Disagreement Notice and by Buyer in
the Preliminary Adjustment Statement. The Independent Accounting Firm shall
submit such verification and calculation to Seller and Buyer as soon as
practicable, but in any event within 30 days after the Unresolved Items are
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. Except for any dispute to the
extent relating to any interpretation of Law or terms of this Agreement, the
determination by the Independent Accounting Firm of the Closing Net Working
Capital, as set forth in a written notice delivered to Buyer and Seller by
the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with this Agreement shall be
binding and conclusive on Buyer and Seller.

(h) The Closing Net Working Capital as determined after all disputes have
been resolved in accordance with this _Section 2.4_ is referred to herein as
the "Final Net Working Capital."

 

(i) Buyer and Seller agree that the procedures set forth in this _Section
2.4_ for resolving disputes with respect to the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement and the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital shall be the sole
and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes; _provided_ that this
provision shall not prohibit any party from instituting litigation to enforce
any decision pursuant to the terms hereof by the Independent Accounting Firm
in any court of competent jurisdiction. The substance of the Independent
Accounting Firms determination shall not be subject to review or appeal,
absent a showing of fraud. It is the intent of the parties to have any
determination of Unresolved Items by the Independent Accounting Firm proceed
in an expeditious manner; _provided_ , _however_ , that any deadline or time
period contained herein may be extended or modified by agreement of the
parties and the parties agree that the failure of the Independent Accounting
Firm to strictly conform to any deadline or time period contained herein shall
not be a basis for seeking to overturn any determination rendered by the
Independent Accounting Firm. Any expenses relating to the engagement of the
Independent Accounting Firm in respect of its services pursuant to this
_Section 2.4_ shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer. 

(j) The final purchase price (the "Final Purchase Price") shall be an amount
in cash equal to the Base Price, (i) plus, if the Final Net Working Capital
exceeds the Reference Net Working Capital by more than the Adjustment
Threshold, then an amount equal to the full amount of such excess or (ii)
minus, if the Reference Net Working Capital exceeds the Final Net Working
Capital by more than the Adjustment Threshold, then an amount equal to the
full amount of such excess. The difference (either positive or negative)
between the Initial Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price is referred
to as the "Final Closing Adjustment", and the Final Closing Adjustment shall
be determined by subtracting the Initial Purchase Price from the Final
Purchase Price.

 

(k) Buyer (if the Final Closing Adjustment is a positive number) or Seller (if
the Final Closing Adjustment is a negative number), as the case may be,
shall, within five Business Days after the determination of the Final Net
Working Capital pursuant to this _Section 2.4_, make payment to the other by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated by the other an amount equal to the absolute value of the
Final Closing Adjustment as determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4_.

 



25 Section 2.5 _Casualty Loss_.

 

(a) If, before Closing, any Retail Sites are materially damaged or destroyed
(the portion of any Retail Sites so damaged or destroyed, the "Damaged Retail
Site") whether by fire, theft, vandalism, flood, wind, hurricane, explosion or
other causality (a "Casualty Event"), Seller shall notify Buyer promptly in
writing (a "Casualty Event Notice") of the Casualty Event. The Casualty Event
Notice shall include (i) a reasonable description of the facts and
circumstances surrounding the Casualty Event, (ii) Sellers preliminary
assessment of the effect of the Casualty Event on the relevant Retail Site,
and (iii) the date upon which each Damaged Retail Site sustained a Casualty
Event.

 

(b) If the aggregate Casualty Loss Amount resulting from all Casualty Events
is $15,000,000 (the "Casualty Loss Threshold") or less: (i) none of the
parties rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be affected in any
way; (ii) there will not be a breach of any of Sellers representations or
warranties as a result of such Casualty Event; and (iii) there shall be no
adjustment to the Base Price pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ as a result of
such Casualty Event.

 

(c) If the aggregate Casualty Loss Amount resulting from all Casualty Events
is greater than the Casualty Loss Threshold, then:

 

(i) with respect to any Damaged Retail Site (excluding those Damaged Retail
Sites for which the aggregate Casualty Loss Amount is equal to or less than
the Casualty Loss Threshold) the repairs and restoration of which can
reasonably be expected to be completed on or before the Outside Date, Seller
may elect, by written notice to Buyer, to (x) repair or restore such Damaged
Retail Site or (y) reduce the Base Price by the amount by which the Casualty
Loss Amount in respect of such Damaged Retail Site exceeds the Casualty Loss
Threshold; and

 

(ii) with respect to any Damaged Retail Site (excluding those Damaged Retail
Sites for which the aggregate Casualty Loss Amount is equal to or less than
the Casualty Loss Threshold) the repairs and restoration of which cannot
reasonably be expected to be completed on or before the Outside Date, Buyer
may elect, by written notice to Seller, to (x) have Seller repair or restore
such Damaged Retail Site or (y) reduce the Base Price by the amount by which
the Casualty Loss Amount in respect of such Damaged Retail Site exceeds the
Casualty Loss Threshold; and

 

(iii) the Casualty Loss Amount for each Damaged Retail Site shall be counted
in chronological order from the date of the first Casualty Event when
determining the Casualty Loss Threshold; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a
single Casualty Event results in multiple Damaged Retail Sites with an
aggregate Casualty Loss Amount in excess of the Casualty Loss Threshold, the
parties shall mutually agree upon which Casualty Loss Amounts for the Damaged
Retail Sites are counted towards the Casualty Loss Threshold.

 



26 Any written notice of election contemplated by this _Section 2.5(c)_ by
Seller or Buyer, as applicable, must be made and delivered no later than five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(d) If, with respect to any Damaged Retail Site addressed in _Section
2.5(c)_, either (x) Seller elects to repair or restore or Buyer elects to have
Seller repair or restore such Damaged Retail Site or (y) Seller or Buyer
elects in writing to reduce the Base Price by the Casualty Loss Amount
pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_, such Damaged Retail Site and the Casualty Event
relating thereto shall have no effect for purposes of determining whether
Buyers conditions to Closing set forth in  _Section 6.2_ have been
fulfilled. For purposes of this _Section 2.5_, the Casualty Loss Amount in
respect of any Damaged Retail Site shall be determined upon the mutual
agreement of Seller and Buyer in good faith. In the event Seller and Buyer
cannot agree on the Casualty Loss Amount in respect of any Damaged Retail
Site, the Casualty Loss Amount shall be determined by an independent
contractor mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer.

 

(e) If Seller elects to repair or restore any Damaged Retail Site pursuant to
_Section 2.5(c)(i)_ or if Buyer elects to have Seller repair or restore any
Damaged Retail Sites pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)(ii)_ above, then (i) Seller
at its sole cost and expense shall promptly commence and use reasonable best
efforts to execute the repair and/or restoration of such Damaged Retail Site
with similar grade quality and condition or as is otherwise required in
accordance with applicable Laws, and (ii) in the event any such repair or
restoration is not completed by the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Acquired Entities to, provide Seller and its employees or
contractors with reasonable access to the Damaged Retail Sites for purposes of
completing such repair or restoration.

 

Section 2.6 _Buy-Out of Leveraged Leases_.

 

(a) _Section 2.6(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth, with
respect to each tranche of Leveraged Lease Properties, the date and price of
the early buy-out option applicable to each such tranche (collectively, the
"Leveraged Lease Buy-Out Amounts"). Prior to the Closing, Seller shall acquire
those Leveraged Lease Properties included in tranches with early buy-out
options dates occurring prior to the Closing (such properties, the "Early Buy-
Out Properties"), and the Initial Purchase Price shall be increased by an
amount equal to the aggregate amount of the early buy-out option prices for
all such tranches (such aggregate amount, the "Leveraged Lease Adjustment
Amount"). No later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
will confirm to Buyer in writing that it has acquired ownership of the Early
Buy-Out Properties, and _Section 1.1(LL)_, _Section 2.6(a)_ and _Section
3.10(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed automatically
amended to remove all Leveraged Leases covering the Early Buy-Out Properties
from such sections, and _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed automatically amended to add all of such Early Buy-Out
Properties; _provided_ , _however_ , with respect to any Owned Real Property
that is an Early Buy-Out Property, the representations and warranties in
_Section 3.10(a)_ and _Section 3.10(c)_ shall be made solely as of the
Closing Date and not as of the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) At the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall enter into a Lease and Buy-Out
Agreement in respect of all of the Leveraged Lease Properties other than the
Early Buy-Out

 



27  Properties, on terms consistent with those set forth on _Exhibit F_ hereto
(the "Lease and Buy-Out Agreement"). _Section 2.6(b)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule sets forth the annual lease payment amounts with respect
to each tranche of Leveraged Lease Properties. Such amounts, excluding amounts
for periods occurring prior to the Closing (and pro-rated to the date of
Closing in respect of any partial year) and excluding amounts for tranches of
Leveraged Lease Properties that have become Early Buy-Out Properties as of the
Closing, shall be included in the Lease and Buy-Out Agreement as the lease
payment obligations of Buyer in respect of the Leveraged Lease Properties
(excluding those that have become the Early Buy-out Properties). The Lease and
Buy-Out Agreement also shall include, as post-Closing obligations of Buyer,
the Leveraged Lease Buy-Out Amounts in respect of all Leveraged
Lease Properties other than those that have become Early Buy-Out Properties
as of the Closing Date (which excluded buy-out amounts will be included in the
Leveraged Lease Adjustment Amount). Upon the request of Buyer, after the date
of this Agreement Seller shall make copies of the Appraisals available to
Buyer. To the extent that the lease amounts or buy-out amounts for the
Leveraged Lease Properties contained in the Seller Disclosure Schedules do not
correspond to the amounts contained in the Appraisals, Seller shall revise
the amounts in the Seller Disclosure Schedules so that they are consistent
with the amounts in the Appraisals.

 

(c) Seller expects (but is not obligated) to acquire ownership of all of the
Leveraged Lease Properties in addition to the Early Buy-Out Properties prior
to the Closing. Seller will advise Buyer from time to time of the status of
such efforts and will notify Buyer of what Leveraged Lease Properties it
acquires pursuant to this _Section 2.6(c)_. Any Leveraged Lease Properties
that Seller acquires (other than the Early Buy-Out Properties) shall remain
subject to the Lease and Buy-Out Agreement and no adjustments shall be made to
the Initial Purchase Price or to the amount or timing of the lease payment
or buy-out amounts to be included in the Lease and Buy-Out Agreement with
respect to such additional acquired Leveraged Lease Properties, and Buyer
shall not acquire ownership of such additional acquired Leveraged Leased
Properties at the Closing, but shall do so only after the Closing in
accordance with the terms of the Lease and Buy-Out Agreement. In addition,
_Section 1.1(LL)_ and _Section 3.10(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed automatically amended to remove all Leveraged Leases covering
such additional acquired Leveraged Lease Properties from such sections, and
_Section 3.10(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
automatically amended to add all of such additional acquired Leveraged Lease
Properties; _provided_ , _however_ , with respect to any such additional
acquired Leveraged Lease Properties within the scope of this _Section
2.6(c)_, the representations and warranties in  _Section 3.10(a)_ and
_Section 3.10(c)_ shall be made solely as of the Closing Date and not as of
the date of this Agreement. If not all of the Leveraged Lease Properties are
acquired by Seller prior to the Closing, any Leveraged Lease Property that
remains subject to a Leveraged Lease shall be treated in the Lease and Buy-Out
Agreement as being subleased by Buyer (rather than being leased).

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

 

Except as set forth on the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller represents and
warrants to Buyer as of the date of this Agreement as follows (it being
understood that the specification of any dollar amount in any representation
or warranty contained in this _ARTICLE III_ is not intended to imply that
such amount, or higher or lower amounts, are or are not material 

 



28  for purposes of this Agreement, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting forth of any such amount in any dispute or controversy between or
among the parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
herein or included on the Seller Disclosure Schedule is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement):

 

Section 3.1 _Due Organization and Good Standing_. Seller is duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware
and each Acquired Entity is duly organized and validly existing and, where
applicable, in good standing (to the extent such concept is legally recognized
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization or formation) under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization or formation, except where
the failure to be so qualified or otherwise authorized or to be in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, adversely affect the Business in any material respect. Seller is,
and each Acquired Entity will be as of the Closing, qualified or otherwise
authorized to act as a foreign corporation and, where applicable, is or will
be, as the case may be, in good standing (to the extent such concept is
legally recognized under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization or
formation) under the Laws of every other jurisdiction in which the ownership,
leasing or operation of the Acquired Assets, or the conduct of the Business,
requires such qualification or authorization under applicable Law, except
where the failure to be so qualified or otherwise authorized or to be in good
standing would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, adversely affect the Business in any material respect. Seller
(solely with respect to the Business) has, and the Acquired Entities will have
as of the Closing (but without giving effect to the Sale), the requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate the
Acquired Assets and to carry on the conduct of the Business as now conducted.

 

Section 3.2 _Authorization of Transaction_. Seller has requisite corporate
power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and
performance by Seller of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly and validly authorized by necessary corporate action on
the part of Seller and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Seller
are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by Seller
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Seller and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by Buyer, constitutes, and each Ancillary Agreement (to the
extent Seller is a party thereto), when executed and delivered by Seller
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the other
parties thereto) shall constitute, a valid and binding obligation of Seller,
enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and general principles of
equity (whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity) and the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought
(collectively, the "Bankruptcy and Equity Principles").

Section 3.3 _Capital Structure; Subsidiaries_.

 



29 (a) _Section 3.3(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
following information for each Acquired Entity: (i) its name and jurisdiction
of organization or formation; (ii) the number of authorized shares or other

combined statements of income of Sellers retail gasoline operations
(including WilcoHess) for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014 (the
"Pro Forma Statements"). The Financial Statements present fairly in all
material respects the financial condition and results of operations of
Sellers retail gasoline operations and WilcoHess, respectively, for the
respective periods then ended and are in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied during the respective periods then ended (except, in the case of
unaudited Financial Statements, for normal year-end adjustments and the
absence of notes), except as described on  _Section 3.7_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or as set forth in the Financial Statements (including the
notes thereto). The Financial Statements are correct and complete in all
material respects and are consistent in all material respects with the books
and records of the Business. The Pro Forma Statements are derived from the
unaudited GAAP financial statements of Sellers retail gasoline operations and
WilcoHess, were prepared as though WilcoHess were wholly owned by Seller as
of the first day of the three-month periods covered thereby, reflect such
adjustments as Sellers management deemed appropriate and are consistent with
the books and records of the Business. Except as set forth on  _Section 3.7_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Acquired Entities will have no
Indebtedness as of the Closing.

otherwise, and whether due or to become due, but excluding any liabilities
related or attributable to Taxes) that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected or reserved against on a balance sheet of the Business other than:
(a) as reflected or reserved against in the Financial Statements (or the notes
thereto); (b) as set forth on _Section 3.8_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule; (c) the liabilities or obligations arising under any Assigned
Contract (to the extent not reflected in the Financial Statements and other

Course of Business that, individually or in the aggregate, are not material to
the Business.

Section 3.9  _Legal Proceedings_. Except for intellectual property matters
and environmental matters, which shall be governed exclusively by _Section
3.17_ and _Section 3.18_, respectively, and except as set forth on  _Section
3.9_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no Actions pending, or, to
the Knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing, which would reasonably be
expected to (a) individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect
the Business in any material respect or (b) challenge the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or seek to enjoin
or prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Except as set forth on  _Section 3.9_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,

injunction or order of any Governmental Entity which would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect the Business
or any Assumed Liability in any material respect.

such Real Property Lease by the other party thereto and the Bankruptcy
and Equity Principles; and (B) to the Knowledge of Seller, neither Seller nor
any of its Subsidiaries (to the extent a party thereto) is in breach or
default in any material respect under such Real Property Lease, and, to the
Knowledge of Seller, no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with
the delivery of notice, the passage of time or both, would constitute such a

that, 

 



33  individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Business in any material respect.

Lease Buy-Out Amounts equal the fair market values for the Leveraged Lease
Properties that are contained in the appraisals, and the lease payment amounts
set forth in _Section 2.6(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are
consistent with the fair market rental rates contained in the appraisals. 

Section 3.11 _Taxes_. Except as set forth on _Section 3.11_ of the Seller

its behalf, all material Tax Returns required to have been filed by it, and

determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service (or is entitled to rely
upon a favorable opinion letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service), and,
to the Knowledge of Seller, nothing has occurred since the date of such
determination letter that is reasonably expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of such plan or result in the revocation of such favorable
determination letter. To the Knowledge of Seller, there have been no non-
exempt prohibited transactions or breaches of fiduciary duty with respect to
the WilcoHess Plans that would reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on

"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or Section 414(f)

respect to which rights, services or other benefits are made available to
Buyer, the Acquired Entities or their respective Affiliates under the
Transition Services Agreement or the Trademark License Agreements, constitute
all of the Intellectual Property that is currently used by Seller and its
Affiliates in, and is necessary for, the conduct of the Business as currently
conducted, except for such Intellectual Property which is not material to the
operation of the Business or which can be readily obtained by Buyer, including
as publicly available "commercial" software packages.

 

(c) Except as set forth on _Section 3.17(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, to the Knowledge of Seller: (i) the conduct of the Business as
currently conducted by Seller is not infringing, misappropriating or violating
any Persons Intellectual Property rights in any material respect, and there
is no material Action pending before any Governmental Entity or threatened in
writing against Seller (in each case, with respect to the Business) or any
Acquired Entities alleging such infringement; and (ii) no Person is
infringing, misappropriating or violating any Business Intellectual Property
owned by Seller in any material respect, and no material claims are pending
before any Governmental Entity or are threatened in writing against any Person
by Seller (in each case, solely with respect to the Business) or any Acquired
Entity alleging such infringement.

(d) Other than as set forth in _Section 3.6(a)_ and this _Section 3.17_, no
other representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made in respect of
intellectual property matters.

Permits, except where the failure to obtain or possess, maintain in full force
and effect, file for timely renewal or amendment, or operate in compliance
with such Environmental Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Business in any material
respect;

(iii) all underground storage tanks ( the "UST") located on the Business Real
Property have been registered and are currently registered with the

Section 5.2 _Employment Matters_.

 

(a) _Employment_. The employment of each WilcoHess Employee shall continue
uninterrupted immediately following the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall take all actions necessary to transfer the employment of
each Business Employee to an Acquired Entity, and the employment of each
Business Employee shall continue uninterrupted immediately following
the Closing Date, on the terms and conditions of employment in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date. If, despite its reasonable best
efforts, Seller identifies, after the Closing Date (but no later than three
(3) months after the Closing Date), a Business Employee who was inadvertently
not transferred to an Acquired Entity prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
promptly notify Buyer of such fact, and the employment of such Business
Employee shall be transferred from Seller (or its Affiliates) to an Acquired
Entity as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. All Business Employees
(including those referred in the immediately preceding sentence) and all
WilcoHess Employees are collectively referred to herein as "Transferred
Employees." Except as otherwise described in _Sections 5.2(b)_ , _(c)_ or
_(d)_ or in subsection (b) of the definition of "Retained Liabilities"
herein, the Acquired Entities shall, effective as of the date of a
Transferred Employees employment by an Acquired Entity, assume or retain all
liabilities and obligations related to the employment and the continuation or
discontinuation of employment of each Transferred Employee, and the terms and
conditions of employment of all Transferred Employees, regardless of whether
such liability or obligation occurs prior to, on or after the Closing. To the
extent separate payroll systems and databases are not established for the
Acquired Entities prior to the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with
each other and transfer, or cause to be transferred, as necessary, all
Transferred Employees from Sellers pre-Closing payroll and databases to the
payroll and databases of Buyer and its Affiliates on the Closing Date.

(b) _Collective Bargaining Agreements_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall take all actions necessary to transfer the Business CBAs to an Acquired
Entity, and, as of the effective date of such transfer, the applicable
Acquired Entity shall assume or otherwise be or remain bound by, and shall
retain or assume all liabilities or obligations under, the Business

 



46  CBAs, regardless of whether such liability or obligation arises or relates
to events occurring prior to, on or after the Closing Date; _provided_ that
Seller shall retain any liability or obligation for any alleged failure to
satisfy any "decision" and "effects" bargaining obligations under the Business
CBAs arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) _Compensation and Benefits Continuation Generally_.

 

(i) _General_. The WilcoHess Plans shall continue uninterrupted immediately
following the Closing Date, and Buyer shall honor, assume, fulfill and
discharge the liabilities and obligations of WilcoHess under all WilcoHess
Plans in accordance with the terms of such WilcoHess Plans. Except as
otherwise provided for under the terms of any Seller Plan or as
otherwise specified in this Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement,
the Transferred Employees shall cease, effective as of the Closing Date, any
active participation in (including eligibility to contribute to) and any
benefit accrual under each Seller Plan. Seller and such Seller Plans shall
retain any liability or obligation under Seller Plans with respect to benefits
accrued or benefit claims incurred by Transferred Employees prior to the
Closing Date. Until at least one year after the Closing Date (or such longer
period required by applicable Law or a Business CBA), Buyer and its Affiliates
shall not reduce any Transferred Employees base salary or base wage rate or
incentive compensation opportunity, each as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing Date, other than any reduction on the basis of performance issues
in Buyers ordinary course of dealings with individual employees, and shall
provide employee and fringe benefits to Transferred Employees that are
reasonably comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such persons
immediately prior to the Closing Date under the applicable Seller Plans listed
on _Section 3.16(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (excluding the Hess
Corporation Employees Pension Plan and the Hess Corporation Employees
Savings Plan,) or the WilcoHess Plans, or as otherwise required by applicable
Law or a Business CBA; provided, however, that, unless otherwise required by a
Business CBA, nothing herein shall require Buyer or its Affiliates to provide
defined benefit pension plan benefits or post-retirement medical benefits to
the Transferred Employees; and, provided further, that Buyer shall provide
defined contribution benefits which are no less favorable than those provided
as of the Closing Date to similarly situated employees of the Buyer under the
Buyer 401(k); and provided further, that defined benefit pension plan
benefits, defined contribution benefits and post-retirement medical benefits
shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether employee and fringe
benefits provided by Buyer to Transferred Employees are reasonably comparable
in the aggregate.

 

(ii) _Service Credit_. Buyer shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliates
to, recognize all service of the Transferred Employees with the Business, the
Acquired Entities, Seller and all of its current or former Affiliates that are
recognized under any Seller Plan or WilcoHess Plan applicable to service-
related or measured entitlements under applicable Law (collectively, the
"Service Credits"). All Service Credits shall be taken into account for
purposes of determining, as applicable, the eligibility for participation,
vesting and level of benefits (excluding credit for benefit accrual purposes
under a defined benefit pension plan and credit for post-retirement medical
plans under Buyers Plans) of any Transferred Employee under all employee

 



47  benefit plans offered by Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer to the Transferred
Employees, including vacation plans or arrangements, 401(k) or other
retirement plans and any severance, welfare plans, or service-related or
measured entitlements under applicable Law.

(iii) _Pre-Existing Conditions_. Buyer shall: (A) waive any limitation on
medical coverage of Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents due to
pre-existing conditions under all applicable medical plans of Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer to the extent such Transferred Employees or eligible
dependents are currently covered under a medical plan of Seller or its
Affiliates; and (B) credit Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents
with all payments credited against out-of-pocket maximums and deductible
payments and co-payments paid by such person, in each case, under the medical
plan of Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date during the year in
which the Closing occurs for the purpose of determining the extent to which
any such person has satisfied his or her deductible and whether he or she has
reached the out-of-pocket maximum under any medical plan of Buyer or an
Affiliate of Buyer for such year.

 

(d) _COBRA_. Subject to the terms of the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer
and its Affiliates shall assume, and the Acquired Entities shall have, all
obligations to provide notice and continuation health care coverage in
accordance with Section 4980B of the Code and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of
ERISA ("COBRA") to all Transferred Employees and their qualified
beneficiaries who incur a qualifying event under COBRA at any time on or after
the Closing. Seller and its Affiliates shall retain all obligations to provide
continuation health care coverage in accordance with COBRA to all
Business Employees and their qualified beneficiaries who incur a qualifying
event under COBRA with respect to any Seller Plan that is a group health plan
as a result of the Closing, or who were entitled to COBRA under such Seller
Plan as a result of a qualifying event under COBRA that occurred prior to the
Closing.

(e) _Pension and Multiemployer Plans_. Buyer shall assume the rights and
obligations of Seller pursuant to the terms of each Business CBA with respect
to pension benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Seller or
any of its Affiliates have any obligation or liability for pension
benefits under any Business CBA, nor shall the terms of any such Business CBA
increase any benefit under any Seller Pension Plan to any person. To the
extent required under a Business CBA, Buyer or an Acquired Entity shall
continue participation in and shall assume or retain all obligations and
liabilities with respect to the multiemployer plans (within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA) described in such Business CBA, regardless of whether
such obligations or liabilities arise or relate to events occurring prior to,
on, or after the Closing. The parties intend that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement constitute a "change in corporate structure"
within the meaning of Section 4218(1)(A) of ERISA with respect to the
Business such that no withdrawal from such multiemployer plan shall occur as a
result of such transactions. Each party will cooperate and take reasonable and
appropriate steps to ensure that the applicable multiemployer plan has
sufficient information to make such determination.

(f) _Defined Contribution Plans_. Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to, maintain or establish a defined contribution plan and trust
for the benefit of

 



48  Transferred Employees (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan"). Buyer shall be responsible
for taking all necessary, reasonable, and appropriate action to establish,
maintain, and administer the Buyer 401(k) Plan so that it is qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and that the related trust thereunder is exempt
under Section 501(a) of the Code. Each Transferred Employee who participates
in the Sellers 401(k) plan (the "Business 401(k) Plan Beneficiaries") shall,
as of the Closing Date, be treated as a terminated participant under the
Sellers 401(k) plan. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date and in
accordance with the terms of the Sellers 401(k) plan, each Business 401(k)
Plan Beneficiary shall be given the option to receive a distribution of his or
her account balance under the Sellers 401(k) plan from such plan and, in
accordance with law and the terms of the Buyer 401(k) Plan, elect to roll
over such amount excluding any outstanding loans into the Buyer 401(k) Plan.

(g)  _Cooperation_. Within five days of the execution of this Agreement,
Seller will provide Buyer with a list of all Business Employees and WilcoHess
Employees, including for each such employee his or her current job title,
FLSA classification, base salary and hourly wage rate, and work location, and
such other current information as Buyer may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the transfer of the Business Employees to Buyers systems and
employee benefit plans, which list shall be updated by Seller, from time to
time, prior to Closing. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, cooperate with Seller to provide such current information
regarding the Transferred Employees on an ongoing basis as may be necessary
to facilitate determinations of eligibility for, and payments of benefits to,
the Transferred Employees under any applicable Seller Plan that continues to
be maintained by Seller or its Affiliates. Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, permit Transferred Employees to provide such assistance to
Seller as may be required in respect of claims against Seller or its
Affiliates, whether asserted or threatened, to the extent that, in Sellers
opinion, (i) any Transferred Employee has knowledge of relevant facts or
issues, or (ii) an Transferred Employees assistance is reasonably necessary
in respect of any such claim. In addition, upon Sellers reasonable request,
Buyer shall and shall cause its Affiliates to, make the Transferred Employees
available to Seller and its Affiliates in connection with the services and
other transactions contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement, in
accordance with the terms of such Transition Services Agreement, subject to
applicable Law, Seller shall provide Buyer with such information regarding the
Transferred Employees as Buyer may reasonably request (and in the timeframe
reasonably required by Buyer) prior to, and following, the Closing in order
for Buyer to comply with its obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.2_.

(h) _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this _Section 5.2_ shall create
any third party beneficiary right in any Person (other than the parties to
this Agreement), including any Transferred Employee, any participant in any
Seller Plan or WilcoHess Plan, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or
any right to continued employment with Buyer, Seller, the Acquired Entities or
any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 5.2_ shall
constitute an amendment to any Seller Plan, WilcoHess Plan or any other plan
or arrangement covering any Transferred Employees.

Section 5.3 _Access to Information_.

(a) Subject to _Section 5.4_, Seller shall cause its Representatives to
afford Representatives of Buyer reasonable access during normal business
hours to the officers,

 



49  directors, employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities of
the Business and the Acquired Assets (including all Business Real Property)
and the books and records relating thereto, and shall furnish Buyer with such
financial, operating and other data and information with respect to the
Business and the Acquired Assets as Buyer, through its Representatives, may
reasonably request; _provided_ that such access shall only be upon the
reasonable advance request of Buyer, shall not unreasonably disrupt personnel,
operations and properties of the Business, and shall be at Buyers sole risk
and expense. In exercising its rights hereunder, Buyer shall conduct itself
so as not to unreasonably interfere in the conduct of the Business prior to
the Closing. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that any contact or communication
by Buyer and its Representatives with officers, employees or agents of the
Business hereunder shall be arranged and supervised by Representatives of
Seller, unless Seller otherwise expressly consents in writing with respect to
any specific contact. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Entities) shall be required to disclose to Buyer or any of its
Representatives any: (i) information: (A) relating to any sale or divestiture
process conducted by Seller or its Affiliates for the Business or Sellers or
its Affiliates (or their Representatives) evaluation of the Business in
connection therewith, including projections, financial or other information
relating thereto; (B) if doing so could violate any Contract (provided that
Seller shall use reasonable efforts to obtain consents or waivers from third
parties under any such Contract in order to disclose such information to Buyer
(it being understood that in no event shall Seller or its Affiliates
be obligated to pay any consent fee or other consideration in connection with
their efforts to obtain such consents or waivers)) or Law to which Seller or
any of its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) is a party or is
subject or which it believes in good faith could result in a loss of the
ability to successfully assert a claim of privilege (including attorney-client
and work product privileges); or (C) if Seller or any of its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in a litigation and such information is reasonably pertinent
thereto; or (ii) Hess Group Tax Return or any other information relating to
Taxes or Tax Returns (other than information relating solely to the Business
and the Acquired Entities). Prior to the Closing, Buyer shall not (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries, Representatives and agents not to) use any information
obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.3(a)_ for any purpose unrelated to the
transactions described in this Agreement. In addition, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not have the right to perform or
conduct, or cause to be performed or conducted, any environmental sampling or
testing at, in, on or underneath any Business Real Property prior to the
Closing.

(b) Except as provided otherwise in  _Section 5.17_, the parties shall
retain the books, records, documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence,
writings, evidence of tile and other papers relating to the Business, the
Acquired Entities and the Acquired Assets in their possession or the
possession of their Affiliates until seven years following the Closing Date or
such longer period as may be required by Law or applicable court order until
the expiration of the relevant representation or warranty under
this Agreement. After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Buyer
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Seller and its Representatives
access, during normal business hours, to employees of the Business (including
to prepare and appear as witnesses) and such information (including the right
to make copies), cooperation and assistance relating to the Business and the
Acquired Entities as is necessary for any reasonable business purpose,
including insurance matters, financial reporting and accounting matters, the
preparation and filing of any Tax Return, the defense of any Tax claim or
assessment, in connection with any disclosure obligation or the defense of any
Action (including

  



50  any Action that constitutes a Retained Liability). Seller shall reimburse
Buyer for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting
Seller pursuant to this  _Section 5.3(b)_.

Section 5.4 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Buyer and its Representatives shall treat all nonpublic information
obtained in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby as confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated
by reference and shall continue in full force and effect, except that
the confidentiality and standstill obligations in the Confidentiality
Agreement with respect to information relating to the Business will terminate
at the Closing. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect as provided in _Section 7.2_ hereof in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Entities) to, continue to keep confidential and not
use for any purpose all nonpublic information regarding Seller or its
Affiliates (except to the extent relating to the Acquired Entities the
Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Business) of which such
Persons may be aware, _provided_ that Buyer and its Representatives may
disclose such information if required by judicial or administrative process or
by any other requirements of applicable Law, regulation or regulatory process.

 

(c) From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, keep confidential and not use for any purpose
all confidential and proprietary information to the extent relating to Buyer,
the Acquired Entities, the Acquired Assets, the Business and the Assumed
Liabilities of which such Person may be aware; _provided_ that Seller and its
Representatives may disclose such information if required by judicial or
administrative process or by any other requirements of applicable Law,
regulation or legal or regulatory process. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict any use
or disclosure by Seller or its Representatives of any nonpublic information of
the Acquired Entities, the Acquired Assets, the Business or the Assumed
Liabilities to the extent such use or disclosure is necessary for Seller and
such Representatives to handle post-Closing matters as required or permitted
by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, including in connection with any
adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price, the provision of services and
the performance of other obligations pursuant to any of the Ancillary
Agreements, any indemnification claim made by any Buyer Indemnified Party, any
post-Closing Tax filings, any filings with or audit by any Governmental
Entity, the preparation of financial statements or in furtherance of any
other reasonable business purposes.

(d) If any party is required by Law, regulation or legal or regulatory
process to disclose any nonpublic information contemplated by _Sections
5.4(b)_ and _5.4(c)_ , such party being required to make such disclosure (the
"Disclosing Party") shall (i) if and as may be requested by the other party
and at such other partys sole cost and expense, take all reasonable steps to
preserve the confidentiality of such information, including requesting that
such information not be disclosed to non-parties or the public; (ii) to the
extent reasonably permissible under applicable Law, give the other party
prompt written notice of such request or requirement

 



51  so that such other party may seek, at its sole cost and expense, an
appropriate protective order or other remedy; and (iii) cooperate with the
other party, at such other partys sole cost and expense, to obtain such
protective order. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is
not obtained, such Disclosing Party will furnish only that portion of such
information which, on the advice of such Disclosing Partys counsel, is
legally required to be disclosed and, upon the other partys request and at
the other partys sole cost and expense, use commercially reasonable efforts
to seek confidential treatment (to the extent available) of such information.

Section 5.5 _Regulatory Filings and Authorizations_.

 

(a) Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
cooperate with each other to determine whether any filings are required to be
made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, clearances (including any
national security clearances), waivers or approvals are required to be
obtained from, any Governmental Entities under any applicable Law in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Sale. Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and Subsidiaries to,
promptly file or cause to be filed, , all necessary Governmental Filings
required in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Sale, including: (i) filing within 15 Business Days of
the date of this Agreement the Pre-Merger Notification and Report Form under
the HSR Act; (ii) filing, as soon as practicable, all other filings required
under applicable Law or by Governmental Entities in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Sale;
and (iii) submissions of additional information reasonably requested by any
Governmental Entity. Except as provided otherwise in _Section 5.6_, the costs
of all Governmental Filings shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller. 

(b) Seller and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and promptly furnish the other with copies of material communications between
Seller (including its Representatives) or Buyer (including its
Representatives), as the case may be, and any Governmental Entity with respect
to the filings described in _Section 5.5(a)_. Seller and Buyer shall keep
each other timely apprised of any material inquiries or material requests for
additional information from any Governmental Entity pursuant to applicable Law
in connection with the filings described in _Section 5.5(a)_, and shall
comply promptly with any such reasonable inquiry or request. Seller and Buyer
shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental Entity
relating to the filings described in _Section 5.5(a)_. Each of Seller and
Buyer agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion,
either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Governmental Filings described in _Section 5.5(a)_ unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate. If prior notice of such meetings is not reasonably practicable,
each of Seller and Buyer will promptly inform the other of the substance of
such meeting or discussion.

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including this 
_Section 5.5_, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other and use their
respective

 



52  reasonable best efforts to ensure that all necessary and appropriate
consents, approvals, waivers, actions, non-actions, or other authorizations
from Governmental Entities, including any antitrust clearance under the HSR
Act, are obtained as promptly as practicable, and that any conditions set
forth in or established by any such consents, clearances, approvals, waivers,
actions, or non-actions or other authorizations from Governmental Entities
are wholly satisfied according to their terms. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, without limiting the generality of the
other undertakings pursuant to this _Section 5.5_, and in furtherance of the
foregoing, Buyer shall agree to take or cause to be taken the following
actions: (i) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry
or enactment of any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or
other order, decree, decision, determination, judgment or Law that would
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Sale; (ii) the prompt use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in the event
that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision, order,
judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or enacted, or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted, in any
proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the
Sale in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Sale, any and all steps (including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond
or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (i) of this _Section
5.5(c)_) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate, avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so
as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) such steps (if any) as may be
required to ensure that no state divorcement Law (and no Action brought in
respect thereof) prevents or delays the Closing.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, nothing in this _Section 5.5_
shall require (and reasonable best efforts shall in no event require) any of
Buyer, Seller or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to agree to or
take any action that, individually or in the aggregate, has or would be
reasonably likely to have (i) in the case of Seller or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, a Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) in the case of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, a material adverse effect on the
assets, liabilities, business, results of operations or financial condition
of Buyer and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, taken as a whole, and after
giving effect to Buyers acquisition of the Business, _provided_ , that in
determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred or would be
reasonably likely to occur under this clause (ii), Buyer and its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates shall be deemed to be of a size, in terms of assets,
liabilities, business and results of operations, equal to the size of the
Business, and any actions that Buyer or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates take or
are required to take to comply with applicable divorcement Laws shall not be
considered. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement,
(A) Seller shall have no obligation whatsoever to retain, sell, otherwise
dispose of, hold separate or license or otherwise grant any rights in or to,
any portion of the Business or any of its other businesses, assets or
operations in order to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 5.5_,
except to the extent (x) related solely to the Business (but not involving the
retention by Seller or any Retained Subsidiary of any portion of the Business)
and (y) conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing; and (B) Buyer and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall have no obligation whatsoever to sell,
divest or otherwise dispose of, hold separate, license or otherwise grant any
rights to any of their assets, businesses, product lines, or properties other
than company owned (whether by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates) retail fuel and convenience store

 



53  locations, including the Retail Sites (and related tangible or intangible
assets necessary to effectuate the sale of such locations as they are
currently operated in the ordinary course, and including, if necessary, the
entering into any transition services or supply agreements), or contracts or
commitments (including for the supply of petroleum products) with retail
branded fuel locations.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.5_ does not apply to Sellers
obligations with respect to the potential transfer of Seller Business
Permits, which is governed exclusively by _Section 5.6_.

Section 5.6 _Separation Activities_.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, subject to _Section 2.1_ (with respect to the
separate conveyance of the Equity Interests of Hess Wilco Holdings, LLC (and
hence the WilcoHess 56% Equity Interests) and the separate conveyance of
certain Acquired Assets) and _Section 5.6(c)_, Seller shall: (i) sell,
assign, transfer, convey and deliver to the Acquired Company, and the
Acquired Company shall accept the assignment, transfer, conveyance and
delivery of, all Equity Interests in the Acquired Entities (other than the
Acquired Company); (ii) sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to an
Acquired Entity, and the Acquired Entities shall accept the assignment,
transfer, conveyance and delivery of, and (as applicable) assume, all of the
Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, in each case to the extent that
any such Equity Interest, Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability is not already
owned and held by the Acquired Company or another Acquired Entity, as
applicable, and otherwise in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Contribution/Assignment and Assumption Agreements ((i) and (ii) collectively,
the "Separation Activities"); and (iii) otherwise provide the Acquired
Entities the right to use or the economic benefits of, as contemplated by
_Section 5.6(c)_ and  _Section 5.6(d)_, any Acquired Assets that are not
transferred to an Acquired Entity pursuant to the preceding clause.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 5.6(a)_ shall not be deemed to
apply to any Business Permits, and Sellers obligations with respect to
Business Permits shall be governed by _Section 5.6(b)_. Seller shall keep
Buyer reasonably informed of the details and operational procedures that will
be undertaken by Seller in the Separation Activities, including communicating
with Buyer any and all limitations, including rights of first refusal
procedures, credit assurance requests, consents or other restrictions on
transfer encountered by Seller as part of the Separation Activities, and, to
the extent permissible under applicable Laws, consult with Buyer prior to
engaging in any Separation Activities pursuant to any such limitations or
restrictions; _provided_ that, except for the matters set forth on  _Section
5.6(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller shall not, without the prior
written consent of Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) provide or permit any Subsidiary, including the
Acquired Entities, to provide to any counterparty to any Assigned Contract or
provide in connection with any Business Permit any bond, guaranty, letter of
credit or other form of credit assurance (collectively, "Credit Assurance")
with a guaranteed obligation in excess of $1,000,000 that any such
counterparty may request as a condition to such counterpartys consent to (or
waiver of consent for) the performance of any Separation Activity for an
Assigned Contract; _provided further_ , that if Seller is prevented from
conducting a Separation Activity with respect to an Assigned Contract as a
consequence of Buyers failure to provide its consent to the provision of
Credit Assurance to such counterparty, such affected Assigned Contract will
be treated under _Section 5.6(c)_ as an Acquired Asset for which consent was
not obtained prior to

 



54  Closing and Seller shall be deemed to have complied with its obligation
under this _Section 5.6(a)_ with respect to such Assigned Contract for
purposes of this Agreement, including Section 6.2(b). Seller will provide
Buyer with copies of material definitive documentation for the Separation
Activities from time to time as a material portion of such Separation
Activities are completed.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts
(including, in Sellers sole discretion, by using reasonable best efforts to
transfer any Seller Business Permit to an Acquired Entity, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and the terms of such Seller Business Permit), at
Sellers sole cost and expense, to cause the Acquired Entities to obtain
and maintain all Business Permits that are not held by the Acquired Entities
as of the date of this Agreement. To the extent any Business Permits are not
held by the Acquired Entities as of the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate with each other in good faith and use their respective reasonable
best efforts to implement appropriate arrangements (to the extent permitted
under applicable Law and applicable Business Permits) so as to allow the
continued operation of the Business by the Acquired Entities notwithstanding
the absence of such Business Permits. For the avoidance of doubt, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, from and after the Closing obtaining
and maintaining any Permit necessary or appropriate to operate the Business
shall be Buyers responsibility at its sole cost and expense. In connection
with Sellers efforts under this _Section 5.6(b)_, Buyer shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, guarantees, letters of credit, surety bonds or
similar credit assurances as may be requested by any Governmental Entity. The
foregoing obligations are in addition to the Governmental Filings contemplated
by _Section 5.5_ and shall in no way limit or affect the
respective obligations of the parties under _Section 5.5_.

(c) To the extent that the sale, conveyance, transfer, assignment or
delivery to, or the assumption by, any Acquired Entity of any Acquired Asset
(including any Assigned Contract) or Assumed Liability is prohibited by any
applicable Law or would require any authorizations, approvals, consents or
waivers and such authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not
have been obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, then, unless the parties
hereto shall otherwise agree, the transfer or assignment of such Acquired
Asset or the assumption of such Assumed Liability, as the case may be, shall
be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer, assignment
or assumption shall be null and void until such time as all legal impediments
are removed or such authorization, approval, consent or waiver has been
obtained or made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Asset or liability
shall continue to constitute an Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability, as
applicable, for all other purposes of this Agreement.

 

(d) If after the Closing Date any Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability is owned
or held by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, as a consequence of _Section
5.6_, then, insofar as reasonably possible and to the extent permitted by Law
and any applicable Contract: (i) Seller or its Subsidiary owning or holding
such Asset shall thereafter hold such Asset for the use and benefit of Buyer
(at the expense of Buyer); (ii) Buyer shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries (including the Acquired Entities) to, pay, perform and discharge
such liability, on a timely basis and in accordance with the terms thereof, on
behalf of Seller or its Subsidiary holding such liability; and (iii) Seller
or its applicable Subsidiary owning or holding such Asset or liability shall
treat such Asset or liability in the Ordinary Course of Business in accordance
with past practice and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested
by Buyer (at

 



55  Buyers sole expense) in order to place Buyer in a substantially similar
position as if such Asset or liability had been transferred, assigned, assumed
or retained in connection with the Closing to or by the party entitled
thereto and so that all the benefits and burdens relating to such Asset or
liability, including use, risk of loss, potential for gain, and dominion,
control and command over such Asset or liability, and all costs and expenses
related thereto, shall inure from and after the Closing Date to Buyer.

(e) Following the Closing, the parties shall cooperate using their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain promptly any authorizations, approvals,
consents or waivers required for the assignment and transfer of any Acquired
Assets or Assumed Liabilities to an Acquired Entity that were not transferred
prior to Closing. If and when any such authorization, approval, consent or
waiver for the assignment and transfer of any such Assets or liabilities is
obtained or Buyer notifies Seller that Buyer has determined that such
authorization, approval, consent or waiver is no longer necessary, Seller
shall promptly convey, transfer, assign and deliver, or cause to be conveyed,
transferred, assigned and delivered, such Assets or Assumed Liabilities to
Buyer or an Acquired Entity for no further consideration.

Section 5.7 _Publicity_. Seller and Buyer agree to communicate with each other
and cooperate with each other prior to any public disclosure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall coordinate the timing of
any public disclosure. Seller and Buyer agree that no public release, filings,
notifications, announcement or other communications (including any proxy
statement or other communication with shareholders and Governmental Filings)
concerning the terms, conditions or substance of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued, released, filed,
disseminated or published by any party or its Affiliates without the prior
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except that each of Seller and Buyer may issue (x) a
press release upon the execution of this Agreement and (y) such other release
or announcement that, upon the advice of outside counsel, is likely required
by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange upon which the
securities of Seller or Buyer, as applicable, or any of their respective
Affiliates, are listed. Each party shall, to the extent practicable, allow the
other party reasonable time to review and comment on all public releases,
filings, notifications, announcement or other communications (including proxy
statement and other communications with shareholders and Governmental Filings)
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby in advance of their issuance,
release, filing, dissemination or publication. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this _Section 5.7_ shall preclude any party from disclosing this
Agreement or the substance or any relevant details of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on a confidential basis to any of
its Representatives, _provided_ that such Representatives have been informed
of such partys confidentiality obligations hereunder and under the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 5.8 _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, and without limiting or expanding the
obligations of the parties under any other provision of this Agreement,
including those set forth in _Section 5.5_, each of the parties hereto agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
action, to do or cause to be done and to assist and cooperate with the other
party hereto in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws and regulations

 



56  to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including: (i) the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the
parties hereto including preparing for the provision of and receipt of the
Transition Services; (ii) the obtaining of all applicable Permits,
authorizations, approvals, consents and waivers of any Governmental Entity or
third party, including any authorization, approval consent or waiver necessary
to sell, assign, transfer and convey any Assigned Contract to the Acquired
Entities and for the Sale; (iii) the defending of any Actions, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the performance of
the obligations hereunder; (iv) the good faith negotiation of the final forms
of the Transition Services Agreement and the Lease and Buy-Out Agreement
(consistent with _Exhibit E_ and _Exhibit F_ hereto and _Section 2.6_ hereof
and with such changes as Seller and Buyer may otherwise agree in good faith)
and, if requested by Buyer, an off-site fuel supply agreement pursuant to
which Seller will supply fuel to the Business after the Closing, in each case
including the required schedules and exhibits thereto; and (v) the execution
and delivery of such instruments, and the taking of such other actions as the
other party hereto may reasonably require in order to carry out the intent of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Seller and Sellers
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities) or, prior to Closing, the
Acquired Entities, shall be obligated to make any payments (unless required
in connection with the transfer of Permits contemplated by _Section 5.6(b)_)
or otherwise pay any consideration to any third party to obtain any applicable
consent, waiver or approval.

 

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all actions
reasonably necessary so as to allow Seller to be ready and able to provide
the transition services contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement at
Closing.

(c) Subject to _Section 5.6_, within ten years after the Closing Date, if
any party discovers that any Acquired Assets were not transferred to the
Acquired Entities or Buyer as part of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then any such Assets shall be deemed to have
been held in trust by Seller and the Retained Subsidiaries, and Seller shall
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (if applicable) to promptly
transfer, assign and convey such assets to an Acquired Entity or Buyer as
directed by Buyer without any additional consideration therefor.

(d) If any party discovers, within ten years after the Closing Date, that any
of the Acquired Entities owns any Assets that constituted or should have
constituted Excluded Assets as of the Closing Date, or that any Assets that
have otherwise been transferred by Seller or any of its Affiliates to Buyer or
any of its Affiliates were or should have constituted Excluded Assets as of
the Closing Date, then any such Assets shall be deemed to have been held in
trust by the Acquired Entities, Buyer or their Affiliates for Seller and the
Retained Subsidiaries, and Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Entities
and its other Affiliates to, promptly transfer, assign and convey such assets
to Seller (or any of its Affiliates as designated by Seller) without any
consideration therefor.

 

Section 5.9 _Contacts_. During the period commencing on the date hereof and
ending on the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Seller
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
Buyer shall not, and shall cause its officers, directors, employees and other
Representatives not to, contact any suppliers, vendors or dealers
to, franchisees of, or others having material business relationships with,
the Business in

 



57  connection with or pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. In the event Seller provides such
consent, a management employee of Seller shall at all times accompany Buyers
Representative(s) to any meeting with such suppliers or customers and shall
participate with Buyers Representative in any such discussions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 5.9_ shall not limit or
otherwise restrict Buyer or its Affiliates from contacting or having business
dealings with any such Person with whom Buyer or such Affiliate has or may
have business dealings, so long as such contact or business dealings relate
to Buyers or its Affiliates operation of their business and not to Sellers
or its Affiliates business dealing with such Person with respect to the
Business or the Acquired Assets or with respect to any aspect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

Section 5.10 _Disclosure Supplement_. Seller shall have the right from time
to time prior to the Closing to supplement or amend the Seller Disclosure
Schedule with respect to any matter hereafter arising that, if existing or
known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described on the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Except for the amendments
contemplated by _Section 2.6_, such supplemental or amended disclosure: (i)
shall not be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether or not
the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ have been satisfied or for the
purpose of the delivery of the certificate required to be delivered to Buyer
pursuant to _Section 6.2(c)_; (ii) shall be taken into account for the
purpose of determining whether Buyer is entitled to indemnification for any
breach or inaccuracy of any of the representations or warranties set forth in
_ARTICLE III_ to the extent such supplemental or amended disclosure pertains
to events or matters occurring or arising after the date hereof; and (iii)
shall not be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether Buyer
is entitled to indemnification for any breach or inaccuracy of any of the
covenants or the representations or warranties set forth in _ARTICLE III_ to
the extent such supplemental or amended disclosure pertains to events or
matters occurring or arising prior to the date hereof. __

 

Section 5.11 _Termination of Inter-Company Agreements and Balances_.

 

(a) Except for (i) this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) those
Contracts, if any, set forth on  _Section 5.11(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, Seller shall terminate, on or prior to the Closing, all Contracts,
written or oral, between Seller (solely with respect to the Business), any
Retained Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Entities), on the one hand, and any Acquired Entity, on the other
hand (the "Terminating Contracts").

 

(b) Except as set forth on _Section 5.11(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule and other than any payables, receivables or other inter-company
accounts under any Ancillary Agreement, Seller shall, as of the Closing,
eliminate (by way of capital contribution, cash settlement or as otherwise
determined by Seller in its sole discretion) all inter-company accounts
existing prior to the Closing, whether payables or receivables, between
Seller, any Retained Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates (other
than the Acquired Entities), on the one hand, and the Acquired Entities, on
the other hand.

 

Section 5.12 _Termination of Certain Support Services_. Buyer acknowledges
that the Business currently receives from Seller and its Affiliates certain
administrative and

 



58  corporate services and benefits of a type generally provided to other
businesses and Subsidiaries of Seller (the "Support Services"). Seller and
Buyer acknowledge that all Support Services shall cease at Closing, and all
agreements and arrangements (whether or not in writing) in respect thereof
shall terminate as of the Closing Date, with no further obligation of any
party thereto, except to the extent set forth and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Transition Services Agreement.

Section 5.13 _Insurance Matters_. Buyer acknowledges that, except for the
WilcoHess Policies, the policies and insurance coverage maintained in favor of
the Business, the Acquired Entities and the Acquired Assets are part of the
corporate insurance program maintained by Seller and its Affiliates (such
policies, the "Corporate Policies"), and such coverage will not be available
or transferred to Buyer or any Acquired Entity. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, Buyer agrees and agrees to cause the Acquired
Entities not to bring any claim for recovery under any of the Corporate
Policies, whether or not such Person may be so entitled in accordance with the
terms of such Corporate Policies. It is understood that Seller shall be free
at its discretion at any time from and after the Closing to cancel or not
renew any of the Corporate Policies.

Section 5.14 _Certain Intellectual Property Matters_.

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in the Trademark License Agreements,
following the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Entities and
each of Buyers other Affiliates to: (i) cease to make any use (in any form or
manner) of (Y) any names or Trademarks that include the terms "Hess" or
"Hess Corporation," or any other Trademark owned by Seller or any of its
Affiliates, including any of those Trademarks set forth on _Section 5.14(a)_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and/or (Z) any name or Trademark that is
derived from, a variant of or otherwise related to, or that contains or
comprises any the foregoing names or Trademarks (in part or whole, including
any formatives thereof), and including any contractions, combinations,
abbreviations, derivations, translations or transliterations of any such
names and/or Trademarks, and any names or Trademarks confusingly similar to,
or likely to be confusingly similar to, or dilutive of, any of the foregoing,
in any jurisdiction in the world (and regardless of whether alone or in
combination with any other words, phrases or designs) (collectively, all such
names and Trademarks, the "Excluded Marks"), including as part of any company
name or Internet domain name; and (ii) cease to, and not at any time
thereafter, hold itself or themselves out as having any affiliation or
association with Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for any and all costs and expenses incurred in
assigning, transferring, recording and perfecting any and all right, title
and interest of Buyer in the Intellectual Property and IT Assets included in
the Acquired Assets, including the filing and recordation of assignment and
other instruments in order to evidence the transfer of any Intellectual
Property or IT Assets included in the Acquired Assets.

Section 5.15 _Compliance with WARN Act and Similar Statutes_. Provided
that on or before the Closing Seller has supplied Buyer with a true and
complete list of employee layoffs, by date and location, implemented by the
Business in the 90-day period preceding the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold Seller harmless from any and all Losses arising under the
WARN Act for such layoffs to the extent such Losses result from the actions or

 



59  omissions of Buyer or any Acquired Entity (or their respective Affiliates)
occurring on or after the Closing. Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold
Buyer harmless from any and all Losses arising under the WARN Act to the
extent such Losses result from the actions or omissions of Seller or any
Acquired Entity (or respective Affiliates) occurring prior to the Closing (and
without regard to any actions or omissions of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including, from and after the Closing, the Acquired Entities) from and after
the Closing). Buyer and Seller agree that, before and after the Closing, they
will provide one another with advance notice of, and reasonable
cooperation with respect to, the consideration, planning and implementation
of any employee layoffs affecting the Business that could implicate the WARN
Act.

 

Section 5.16 _Mail and Other Communications_. After the Closing Date, each of
Seller, Buyer and their respective Subsidiaries may receive mail, packages,
facsimiles, email and other communications properly belonging to the other (or
the others Subsidiaries). Accordingly, at all times after the Closing Date,
each of Seller and Buyer and their respective Subsidiaries authorizes Seller
and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Buyer and its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, as the case may be, to receive and open (acting solely as agent
for the other party) all mail, packages, facsimiles, email and other
communications received by it and not unambiguously intended for such other
party (or its Subsidiaries) or any of such other partys (or its
Subsidiaries) officers or directors, and to retain the same to the extent
that they relate to the business of the receiving party or, to the extent
that they do not relate to the business of the receiving party, the receiving
party shall promptly deliver such mail, packages, facsimiles, email or other
communications (or, in case the same relate to both businesses, copies
thereof) to the other party. The provisions of this _Section 5.16_ are not
intended to, and shall not be deemed to, constitute an authorization by any of
Seller, Buyer or their respective Subsidiaries to (i) permit the other to
accept service of process on its behalf and neither party is or shall be
deemed to be the agent of the other for service of process purposes or (ii)
waive any rights or privileges in respect of any such mail, package,
facsimile, email or other communication or the information contained therein.

Section 5.17 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Liability for Taxes_.

 

(i) Seller shall be liable for, shall pay (or caused to be paid) and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer from and against all Taxes imposed on the
Acquired Entities or on Seller with respect to the Business for (A) any
taxable period ending prior to the Closing Date and, (B) with respect to any
taxable period beginning before and ending on or after the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period"), the portion of such Straddle Period ending at the close of
the day before the Closing Date, in the manner described in _Section
5.17(a)(iii)_.

 

(ii) Buyer shall be liable for, shall pay (or cause to be paid) and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against
all Taxes imposed on the Acquired Entities or on Buyer or any Acquired Entity
in respect of the Business (A) for any taxable period beginning on or after
the Closing Date and, (B) with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of
such Straddle Period beginning on and including the Closing Date.

 



60 (iii) For purposes of this _Section 5.17_, to the greatest extent permitted
by Law or administrative practice, the parties shall cause the taxable year of
each of the Acquired Entities for purposes of any Tax to close on the day
before the Closing Date. Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability
for Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, except as
provided in the following sentence, the amount of any such Taxes that is
allocable to the portion of such period ending on the day before the Closing
Date shall be deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable
year ended on the day before the Closing Date (for clarification purposes, an
interim closing of the books). In the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis (including real and personal property Taxes) for a Straddle Period,
Seller shall be liable for the product of the amount of such Taxes for the
Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis,
the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding Tax period) and
a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days up to, but not
including, the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire period, and Buyer shall be liable for the remaining amount
of such Taxes. In the case of any franchise Tax or other Tax providing the
right to do business, such Tax shall be allocated to the period during which
the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such Tax is
measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for another period
is obtained by the payment of such Tax. For purposes of any Tax that is
payable for a Straddle Period (including real and personal property Taxes),
the Buyer shall be responsible for the timely payment of such Taxes and Buyer
shall notify Seller of the proration of such Taxes as set forth herein. Seller
shall pay to Buyer its share of such Taxes at least two (2) days prior to the
due date for such Taxes (or, if later, within five (5) days following receipt
of the notice of billing).

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of
Seller and Buyer shall be liable for, shall pay (or cause to be paid) and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the other from and against one-half (1/2) of
any Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be
prepared and timely filed) when due all Tax Returns required to be filed in
respect of Transfer Taxes and shall remit (or cause to be remitted) to the
applicable taxing authorities the Transfer Taxes shown to be due in respect of
such Tax Returns, and shall provide Seller proof of such payment. Seller
shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in the preparation and filing of any
such Tax Returns.

 

(v) The obligations of Seller to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, on the one
hand, and the obligations of Buyer to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnified Parties, on the other hand, pursuant to this _Section 5.17(a)_
shall terminate sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that if there is no applicable
statute of limitations, such obligations shall terminate on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

(vi) Whenever Seller shall be required to pay to Buyer or Buyer shall be
required to pay to any Seller Indemnified Party an amount pursuant to this
_Section 5.17(a)_, such payments shall be made on the later of ten (10)
Business Days after such payments are requested or two Business Days before
the requesting party is required to pay the related Tax liability.

 



61 (b) _Tax Returns_.

 

(i) Seller shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be
filed) (A) all Tax Returns of or that include Seller or any Subsidiary of
Seller that is not an Acquired Entity (a "Hess Group Tax Return") and (B) all
other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the
Acquired Entities, the Business or the Acquired Assets for taxable periods
ending before the Closing Date, and shall remit or cause to be remitted to the
applicable taxing authorities any Taxes shown to be due in respect of such Tax
Returns.

 

(ii) Buyer shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all
other Tax Returns that are required to be filed after the Closing Date by or
with respect to the Acquired Entities, the Business or the Acquired Assets
(including Tax Returns, other than Hess Group Tax Returns, for any Straddle
Period), and Buyer shall remit or cause to be remitted to the applicable
taxing authorities any Taxes shown to be due in respect of such Tax Returns.

(iii) With respect to Tax Returns to be filed by Buyer pursuant to _Section
5.17(b)(ii)_ that relate to a Straddle Period, such Tax Returns shall be filed
in a manner consistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in
prior periods in filing such Tax Returns. For Income Tax Returns, Buyer shall
submit such Income Tax Returns to Seller in draft not later than ninety (90)
days prior to the due date for filing such Income Tax Returns (giving effect
to valid extensions) (or, if such due date is within ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing
Date) for review and approval by Seller. If Seller objects to any item(s)
contained in any such draft Income Tax Return, then Seller shall notify Buyer
of such disputed item(s) and the basis for its objection within 30 days of the
day of receipt of such Income Tax Return, and Buyer and Seller shall act in
good faith to resolve any such dispute for the 30-day period thereafter.
If within 30 days of Sellers delivery of a notice of objection the parties
have not reached an agreement regarding such Income Tax Return, then the
dispute shall be presented to the Independent Accounting Firm, whose
determination (except to the extent relating to any interpretation of Law or
terms of this Agreement) shall be final and binding on both parties and may be
entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. For other Tax Returns
relating to a Straddle Period, Buyer shall submit to Seller such Tax Returns
in draft not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such
Tax Returns (giving effect to valid extensions) (or, if such due date is
within 45 days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date) for review and approval by Seller. If Seller
objects to any item(s) contained in any such draft Tax Return, then Seller
shall notify Buyer of such disputed item(s) and the basis for its objection
within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of such Tax Return. If within five
(5) days of Sellers delivery of a notice of objection the parties have not
reached an agreement regarding such Tax Return, then Buyer may file such Tax
Return incorporating Sellers reasonable objections. Further, for those items
that the parties have not reached an agreement regarding such Tax Return and
which were not incorporated into the Tax Return that was filed, the dispute
shall be presented to the Independent Accounting Firm, whose determination
(except to the extent relating to any interpretation of Law or terms of this
Agreement) shall be final and binding on both

 



62  parties and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.
Buyer shall then prepare and file an amended Tax Return reflecting the
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm, to the extent it was not
incorporated into the initial Tax Return as filed by Buyer.

(iv) Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, refile or otherwise
modify, or grant an extension of any statute of limitations with respect to,
any Tax Return relating (A) in whole or in part to the Acquired Entities, the
Business or the Acquired Assets with respect to any taxable period ending
before the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Seller, which
consent may be withheld in Sellers sole and absolute discretion, or (B) to
the Acquired Entities, the Business or the Acquired Assets with respect to
any Straddle Period, without the prior consent of Seller, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates at any time shall take any action with respect to
any Hess Group Tax Return.

(c) _Refunds and Credits_.

 

(i) Any Tax refund, credit or similar benefit, including interest thereon,
received by or credited to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, from
and after the Closing Date, any Acquired Company) with respect to any Taxes
paid prior to the Closing Date (for the avoidance of doubt, including Taxes
paid prior to the Closing Date in respect of sales or transactions occurring
after the Closing Date) or to any taxable period ending before the Closing
Date, and with respect to any Straddle Period, to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the day before the Closing Date, shall be paid by Buyer to
Seller within five (5) days after the receipt of such Tax refund or the
claiming of such credit or similar benefit.

(ii) For purposes of this _Section 5.17_, where it is necessary to apportion
a refund, credit or similar benefit, between Seller and Buyer for a Straddle
Period, such refund, credit or similar benefit shall be apportioned between
Seller and Buyer as provided in _Section 5.17(a)(iii)_.

(iii) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate in obtaining
as soon as permitted by applicable Law any refund, credit or similar benefit,
to any taxable period ending before the Closing Date, and with respect to any
Straddle Period, to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the day
before the Closing Date, that Seller reasonably believes should be available,
including through filing amended Tax Returns with the applicable taxing
authorities.

 

(iv) Buyer shall not elect to carry back or over any net operating loss or
other Tax item to (A) any Hess Group Tax Return for any period or (B) any
other Tax Return for a period ending before the Closing Date. If any such
carryback or carryover is required by Law and cannot be waived, then any Tax
refund or other Tax benefit resulting therefrom shall be for the account of
Seller.

(d) _Contests_.

 



63 (i) Each of Buyer and Seller shall notify the other in writing within
ten (10) days upon receipt of written notice of any pending or threatened
audit, notice of deficiency, examination, assessment or any other
administrative or judicial proceeding ("Audit") which may affect any Tax
liability for which the other party may be liable pursuant to this _Section
5.17_; _provided_ that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in giving
such notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification
obligation hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
delay.

(ii) Seller shall have the sole and absolute right to: (i) conduct any Audit
or other claim that relates to (A) any Hess Group Tax Return or (B) any other
Tax Return or Tax for a taxable period ending before the Closing Date; (ii)
employ counsel of its choice in connection therewith; and (iii) settle any
such Audit or other claim on such terms as it may determine. Seller and Buyer
jointly shall control any Audit for Taxes in respect of the Acquired Entities
or the Acquired Assets (other than a Hess Group Tax Return) with respect to a
Straddle Period, including entering into a joint defense agreement with
counsel agreeable to both Seller and Buyer. Buyer shall have the sole and
absolute right to: (i) conduct any Audit or other claim that relates to any
Tax Return or Tax for a taxable period beginning on or after the Closing
Date; (ii) employ counsel of its choice in connection therewith; and (iii)
settle any such Audit or other claim on such terms as it may determine.

 

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
with respect to or involving any Acquired Entity shall be terminated as of
the Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, none of the Acquired Entities
shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 

(f) _Tax Matters Cooperation_. Each of Buyer and Seller shall and shall cause
its respective Affiliates to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns of
the Acquired Entities and in respect of the Business or the Acquired Assets
and in connection with any Audit with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision
of records and information reasonably relevant to any such Audit and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
Seller and Buyer shall: retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to each of the Acquired Entities or the Acquired Assets
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions thereof), and shall abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority. In
connection with the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges that Seller may be required
to prepare Tax Returns relating to WilcoHess, its Subsidiaries and its
business after the Closing and Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to
timely provide any records and information required by Seller for, and
otherwise cooperate with Seller in, the timely preparation and filing of such
Tax Returns.

 

(g) _Treatment for United States Income Tax Purposes_. Subject to _Section
5.17(i)_, each of Buyer and Seller shall treat the purchase and sale of the
Acquired

 



64  Company Interest as a purchase and sale of the assets of the Acquired
Company for United States federal Income Tax purposes and, to the greatest
extent permitted by Law, for state and local Income Tax purposes, and will
take no position inconsistent with such treatment on any Income Tax Return or
in any proceeding before the Internal Revenue Service or any state and local
taxing authority.

 

(h) _Characterization of Indemnification Payment_. For all Tax purposes, the
parties agree to treat indemnity payments made pursuant to this _Section
5.17_ or _ARTICLE VIII_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(i)  _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees to file
(or cause to be filed) a joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
(and any similar provision of state, local or non-United States law) to
treat the acquisition of Hess Retail Services, Inc., Merit Oil of Delaware,
Inc. and Merit Oil of Connecticut, Inc. as a purchase and sale of assets for
United States federal Income Tax purposes and, to the greatest extent
permitted by Law, for state, local and non-United States Income Tax purposes.
Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with respect to any such election and any Tax
forms or Tax Returns required to be filed in connection therewith (including
any amendments or revisions of any such Tax forms or Tax Returns).

(j) _Exclusivity_. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 5.17_, all
issues relating to Tax matters shall be governed solely by the provisions of
this _Section 5.17_, except that the provisions of _Section 8.1(a)_ (in
respect of the survival of the representations and warranties set forth in 
_Section 3.11_) and _Section 8.5(c)_ through _Section 8.5(i)_ (inclusive)
shall apply as if such sections were set forth herein.

 

Section 5.18 _Officers , Directors and Managers Indemnification_. From and
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Acquired
Entities not to, except (and then only) to the extent otherwise required by
then applicable Law, modify the provisions in the Acquired Entities (or any
successors) Organizational Documents in existence on the date hereof so as
to reduce, limit or otherwise adversely affect the rights with respect to (i)
the elimination of liability of past and present directors, officers, members
or managers, (ii) indemnification of past and present officers, managers,
directors and employees of the Acquired Entities (in all of their capacities),
as such provisions apply to any officers, managers, directors and employees of
the Acquired Entities prior to the Closing (the "Covered Parties") and (iii)
advancement of expenses to any Covered Parties contained in the Organizational
Documents of the Acquired Entities. The obligations of Buyer under this
_Section 5.18_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Covered Party without the consent of such affected
Covered Party (it being expressly agreed that the Covered Parties shall be
third party beneficiaries of this  _Section 5.18_). In the event any claim
or claims are asserted or made pursuant to the indemnification rights set
forth in this _Section 5.18_, all rights to indemnification in respect of any
such claim or claims shall continue until the disposition of any and all such
claims. Any determination required to be made with respect to whether a
Covered Partys conduct complies with the applicable standard of conduct which
governs the availability of such indemnification shall be made by independent
legal counsel selected by the Covered Party and reasonably acceptable to
Buyer.

 



65 Section 5.19 _Notification of Certain Events_. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees
to promptly notify the other of any fact, event or circumstance that becomes
known to it from and after the execution and delivery of this Agreement that
could reasonably be expected, either individually or when taken together with
any or all other existing facts, events and circumstances known to it, to
result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_ to
be satisfied; _provided_ , that the failure to deliver any notice pursuant to
this  _Section 5.19_ shall not be considered in determining whether the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.3(b)_ have been satisfied.

 

Section 5.20 _Litigation Cooperation_.

 

(a) Following the Closing Date, except as the parties may otherwise agree
pursuant to _Section 8.4_, (i) Buyer shall have exclusive authority and
control over the investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of all then
pending Actions relating to or arising in connection with the Business, other
than a Seller Controlled Action, any Acquired Assets or any
Assumed Liabilities (each, a "Buyer Controlled Action"), including Actions
with respect to the matters set forth on _Section 3.9_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, and may settle or compromise, or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to any such Buyer Controlled Action without the
consent of Seller (as long as such settlement, compromise or judgment (A) does
not impose any liability or obligation on Seller or any of its Affiliates, (B)
involve an admission of wrongdoing by Seller or any of its Affiliates or (C)
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on the
reputation of, or implicate the goodwill of, Seller or any of its Affiliates,
in which case the prior written consent of Seller will be required (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)), and (ii)
Seller shall have exclusive authority and control over the investigation,
prosecution, defense and appeal of all then pending Actions relating to or

obligation on Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (B) involve an admission of
wrongdoing by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or (C) would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse impact on the reputation of, or implicate
the goodwill of, Buyer or any of its Affiliates, in which case the prior

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)). As soon as practicable
following the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Entities to,
use reasonable best efforts to have Seller and any Seller Indemnified Parties
removed as parties to any Buyer Controlled Action in which they are named
parties as soon as is reasonably practicable, and Seller shall, and shall
cause the Retained Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to have any
Acquired Entity removed as a party to any Seller Controlled Action in which
they are named parties as soon as is reasonably practicable.

 

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall use, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to make
available to each other, upon written request, their respective officers,
directors, employees and agents for fact finding, consultation and interviews
and as witnesses to the extent that any such Person may reasonably be required
in connection with any Actions in which the requesting party may from time to
time be involved relating to the Buyer Controlled Actions or Seller Controlled
Actions or the conduct of the Business or the Excluded Businesses. Each of
Seller and Buyer agrees to

 



66  retain, and provide the other party with reasonable access to (including the
right to make copies) to, all books and records in their respective possession
relating to any Buyer Controlled Action or any Seller Controlled Action until
such Action is fully and finally resolved. Notwithstanding anything else to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, the provisions of this _Section
5.20_ shall not apply to Actions brought between Seller and its Affiliates,
on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Entities), on the other hand.

(c) Seller and Buyer agree to be bound, as of the Closing, by the covenants
and agreements set forth on _Section 5.20(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule.

respective reasonable best efforts to, terminate or cause to be terminated,
or cause Buyer or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for
Seller and any Retained Subsidiary (collectively, the "Seller Guarantors") in
respect of all obligations of Seller Guarantors under, or replace or cause to
be replaced, effective as of the Closing Date, any Seller Guaranties (solely
for purpose of this _Section 5.21_, any reference to "Seller Guaranties"
shall also include the guarantees provided by Seller and the letters of
credit issued under Sellers credit facilities referred to in _Section 3.22_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule). Neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller
shall be required to make any payment or incur any out of pocket cost to
obtain the foregoing terminations, substitutions or replacements of any Seller
Guaranties, and Buyer and its Affiliates shall bear all such costs.

 

(b) In the event the actions provided for in _Section 5.21(a)_ above are not
completed by the Closing Date, (i) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller Guarantors from and against all continuing obligations and liabilities
under any such Seller Guaranties (including any such Seller Guaranties in
respect of any Acquired Assets that are assigned, transferred or conveyed
after the Closing pursuant to _Section 5.6_), and (ii) from and after the
Closing, Seller and Buyer shall continue to cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to terminate, or cause Buyer or one of its Affiliates
to be substituted in all respects for Seller Guarantors in respect of all
obligations of Seller Guarantors under, or replace or cause to be replaced,
any such Seller Guaranties, and Buyer shall not and shall not permit the
Business, the Acquired Entities or its Affiliates to (A) renew or extend the
term of or (B) amend any contract to increase the obligations under, or
transfer to another third party, any Contract or other obligation for which
any Seller Guarantor is or would reasonably be expected to be liable under
such Seller Guaranty. To the extent that any Seller Guarantor continues to
have any performance obligations under any such Seller Guaranty (including any
such Guaranty in respect of any Acquired Assets that are assigned,
transferred or conveyed after the Closing pursuant to _Section 5.6_) on or
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to (x)
perform, or cause its Affiliates to perform, such obligations on behalf of
such Seller Guarantor or (y) otherwise take such action as reasonably
requested by Seller so as to put such Seller Guarantor in the same position as
if Buyer or one of its Affiliates, and not such Seller Guarantor, had
performed or were performing such obligations.

69  Buyer, and the breach is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside
Date or is not cured by the earlier of (i) 90 days following Buyers written
notice to Seller of such breach and (ii) the Outside Date; _provided_ that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(d)_ shall not
be available to Buyer if it is then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained herein;

(e) by Seller upon written notice to Buyer, if there shall have been a
material breach of any of the representations, warranties, agreements or
covenants set forth in this Agreement on the part of Buyer which has rendered

Agreement by a party hereto pursuant to  _Section 7.1_ hereof, written
notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other

_Section 9.8_, _Section 9.9_, _Section 9.11_, and _Section 9.19_ shall
survive the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if

party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement or (ii) Buyers failure to pay any portion of the
Initial Purchase Price upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_, Seller or Buyer, as

ARTICLE VIII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 8.1 _Survival_.

 

(a) (i) Except for the Fundamental Representations, the representations and
warranties of Seller and Buyer in ARTICLE III and ARTICLE IV of this
Agreement shall each survive the Closing for a period of 12 months beginning
on the Closing Date and (ii) the Fundamental Representations shall each
survive the Closing for a period of 36 months beginning on the Closing Date; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the representations and warranties made by
Seller in _Section 3.11_ shall not survive Closing. For purposes of each
partys indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE VIII,
such representations and warranties shall only be effective with respect to
any breach or claim when notice of such breach or claim shall have been given
in writing to the party against whom indemnification is sought within such
applicable survival period. Any claim for indemnification for which notice
has been given within the applicable

 



70  survival period may be resolved to conclusion notwithstanding the subsequent
expiration of such survival period.

 

(b) All covenants and agreements contained herein which by their terms are to
be performed in whole or in part, or which prohibit actions, subsequent to
the Closing Date, shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms.
All covenants and agreements contained herein that are to be performed prior
to or as of Closing shall not survive the Closing, and claims for
indemnification in respect of any breach thereof shall terminate if not made
on or before the twelve month anniversary of the Closing Date.

Section 8.2 _Obligations of Seller_. If the Closing occurs, subject to the
terms of this _ARTICLE VIII_ and _Section 8.1_, Seller agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates and their officers and
directors (collectively, "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from and against,
without duplication, direct and indirect damages, liabilities, claims,
reasonable costs and expenses, penalties, judgments and settlements
(collectively, "Losses") incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party resulting
from or arising out of: (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty made by Seller in ARTICLE III (other than _Section 3.11_); (ii)
any breach of, or default in the performance of, any covenant or agreement of
Seller in this Agreement; and (iii) any Retained Liabilities (other than any
Retained Liabilities that are Tax Liabilities, which shall be governed
exclusively by  _Section 5.17_); _provided_ that, so long as Seller complies
with its obligations under _Section 5.6_, no breach of this Agreement shall
be deemed to have occurred relating to the title to, or the transfer or
delivery of, any Acquired Asset or Assumed Liability prior to the 30 month
anniversary of the Closing Date.

Section 8.3 _Obligations of Buyer_. If the Closing occurs, subject to the
terms of this _ARTICLE VIII_ and _Section 8.1_, Buyer agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
officers and directors (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from
and against direct or indirect Losses incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party
resulting from or arising out of: (i) any breach or any inaccuracy of a
representation or warrant made by Buyer in _ARTICLE IV_ ; (ii) any breach of,
or default in the performance of, any covenant or agreement of Buyer in this
Agreement; (iii) any Assumed Liabilities (other than any Assumed Liabilities
that are Tax Liabilities, which shall be governed exclusively by _Section
5.17_); (iv) the conduct of the Business following the Closing; and (v) any
use by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of the Excluded Marks that is in breach
of this Agreement.

Section 8.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) If any of the Persons to be indemnified under this _ARTICLE VIII_ (an
"Indemnified Party") has suffered or incurred any Loss, the Indemnified Party
shall so notify the party from whom indemnification is sought (such party from
whom indemnification is sought, the "Indemnifying Party") promptly in writing
describing the event giving rise to such Loss, the basis upon which
indemnification is being sought, the amount or estimated amount of the Loss
(if known or reasonably capable of estimation), and the method of computation
of such Loss, all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference to
the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Loss shall have
occurred.

 



71 (b) In the event that any claim is brought by a third party for which an
Indemnifying Party may be liable to an Indemnified Party hereunder or any
Action is commenced by a third party involving such claim (a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of such Third Party Claim (the "Claim Notice"); _provided_ that no
delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in giving any such Claim Notice
shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation
hereunder unless the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay. Any such
Claim Notice shall describe the event giving rise to such Third Party Claim,
the basis upon which indemnification is being sought, the amount or estimated
amount of Loss arising or expected to arise from such claim (if known or
reasonably capable of estimation), and the method of computation of such Loss
or expected Loss, all with reasonable particularity and containing a reference
to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such Loss shall have
occurred or is expected to occur. The Indemnifying Party shall have 60 days
from its receipt of the Claim Notice (the "Notice Period") to notify the
Indemnified Party whether or not the Indemnifying Party desires, by counsel
of its own choosing, to defend against such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend against such Third Party Claim (which
undertaking shall not constitute an admission or agreement that the
Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party
hereunder): (i) the Indemnifying Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to defend and protect the interests of the Indemnified Party with respect to
such Third Party Claim; and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to any settlement
which (x) does not contain an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party
from the subject matter of the settlement or (y) imposes an injunction or
other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in any event, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
control, pay or settle any Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying
Party shall have undertaken to defend so long as the Indemnified Party shall
also waive any right to indemnification therefor by the Indemnifying Party. If
the Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend against such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
and its counsel in the investigation, defense and settlement thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel reasonably acceptable
to Indemnifying Party at the expense of Indemnifying Party if in the
reasonable opinion of both counsel to the Indemnified Party and counsel to the
Indemnifying Party (or, if they disagree, of an independent counsel
acceptable to each of them) a conflict or potential conflict exists between
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make such separate
representation necessary; _provided further_ that the Indemnifying Party
shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus any
appropriate local counsel) for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any
single Third Party Claim or a series of related Third Party Claims.

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not undertake within the Notice Period to
assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall nevertheless have the right to participate in any such defense at its
sole cost and expense, but, in such case, the Indemnified Party shall control
the investigation and defense of such Third Party Claim. Under
no circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have any liability in connection
with any settlement, compromise, discharge or any proceeding that is entered
into without its prior written consent. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party agree to make available to each other, their respective
counsel and other Representatives, all information and documents (at no cost
to the Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket

 



72  expenses of the Indemnified Party)) that (i) are available to such party and
(ii) reasonably related to any indemnification claim brought under this
_ARTICLE VIII_. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and their
respective employees also agree to render to each other such assistance and
cooperation as may reasonably be required to ensure the proper and adequate
defense of such claim or demand.

 

Section 8.5 _Limitations on Liability._

 

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing:

 

(i) solely with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty made by Seller in _ARTICLE III_  (other than the Fundamental
Representations), (x) Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify Buyer
Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.2(i)_ unless and until the amount
of all Losses incurred by Buyer exceeds 5% of the Base Price in the
aggregate, in which event the Buyer Indemnified Parties may recover Losses
incurred in excess of such amount from the first dollar above such amount, and
(y) Sellers maximum liability for Losses under  _Section 8.2(i)_ shall be
15% of the Base Price;

(ii) solely with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty made by Seller in _Section 3.6(a)_, Seller shall not be obligated to
indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 8.2(i)_ unless and
until the amount of all Losses incurred by Buyer in respect of such breaches
exceeds $5,000,000 in the aggregate, in which event the Buyer Indemnified
Parties may recover Losses incurred from the first dollar of such Losses; and

 

(iii) in no event shall Sellers aggregate liability for Losses under _Section
8.2(i)_ in respect of breaches or inaccuracies of Fundamental Representations
exceed the Final Purchase Price.

(b) Solely for the purposes of determining whether any breach or inaccuracy
of a representation or warranty by a party has occurred or the amount of
Losses resulting from or arising out of any breach or inaccuracy of any
representations or warranties of either party in connection with the assertion
of an indemnification claim under this _Article VIII_ , such determination
shall be made without regard to any qualifier as to "material," "materiality"
or "Material Adverse Effect" as expressly contained in such representations
and warranties (other than the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 3.12_).

(c) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party, the amount of any
indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of any other Loss
for which an indemnification claim has been made under any other
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement and shall be computed net
of: (i) payments recovered by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policy
with respect to such Losses (net of any increase in premium resulting from the
coverage for such Loss); (ii) any prior or subsequent recovery actually
received by the Indemnified Party from any Person with respect to such Losses
(including pursuant to any indemnification agreement or arrangement with any
third party); and (iii) any Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Losses.

 



73 (d) In respect of any Loss for which indemnification may be sought pursuant to
_ARTICLE VIII_ , the Indemnified Party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates
to) (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses upon
becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to, or does,
give rise thereto, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue all
legal rights and remedies available (including insurance recoveries and third
party indemnification) in order to minimize the Losses to which it may be
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to
make any payment to an Indemnified Party in respect of such Loss to the extent
such Indemnified Party has failed to comply with its obligations under this
_Section 8.5(d)_.

(e) To the extent that Seller makes any payment pursuant to this
_ARTICLE VIII_ in respect of Losses for which Buyer or any of its Affiliates
have a right to recover against a third party (including an insurance
company), Seller shall be subrogated to the right of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates to seek and obtain recovery from such third party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if Seller shall be prohibited from such subrogation, Buyer or
its Affiliates, as applicable, shall seek recovery from such third party on
Sellers behalf and pay any such recovery to Seller.

(f) The parties agree that except for (A) the indemnities provided for in
_Section 5.15_,  _Section 5.17_ and _Section 5.21_ (B) any remedy for
Losses that Indemnified Parties may have to the extent arising out of fraud,
(C) any claims seeking an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief, from and after the Closing and (D) any remedy for Losses that are
provided pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement the remedies provided in this
_ARTICLE VIII_ shall be deemed the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties,
from and after the Closing Date, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and each Indemnified Party expressly waives
and relinquishes, on behalf of itself, its successors and any assigns, any and
all rights, claims or remedies such Person may have other than under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ against any Indemnifying Party or any Affiliate thereof (and
any of their respective Representatives), any statutory, equitable, or common
law rights or remedies relating to any environmental matters. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in no event shall any party, its
successors or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek rescission of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(g) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify, defend and save Buyer or any
of its Affiliates from Losses for environmental contamination matters where
the environmental contamination giving rise to such Losses is discovered as a
result of Buyer or any of its Affiliates conducting or arranging to conduct
sampling and analysis of soil, sediment, surface water or groundwater
monitoring wells, or the removal of UST, in each case at any Business Real
Property after the Closing Date, and outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

 

(h) The amount of any Losses to which an Indemnified Party is entitled to be
indemnified with respect to any claim shall be calculated net of any
adjustment to the Initial Purchase Price made pursuant to _Section 2.4_
hereof and for any accruals, reserves or provisions therefor reflected in the
Final Closing Adjustment or the Financial Statements, without limiting the
foregoing, an Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to indemnify any
Indemnified Party with respect to any breach or inaccuracy in any of the
representations,

 



74  warranties, covenants or agreements of an Indemnifying Party under this
Agreement to the extent the Initial Purchase Price has been adjusted in
respect of the subject matter thereof.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _ARTICLE VIII_ , "Losses"
shall not include liability for (i) punitive damages of any kind or nature,
regardless of the form of action through which damages are sought or (ii)
consequential damages or lost profits (including, loss of profit or revenue,
any multiple of reduced cash flow or any adjustments based on price to
earnings or similar ratios), interference with operations, or loss of
customers, tenants, lenders, investors or buyers or diminution in the value of
property, unless, in each case of subsections (i) and (ii) above,
actually awarded by a Governmental Entity in a Third Party Claim.

ARTICLE IX

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 9.1 _No Reliance_.

 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that it has conducted to its satisfaction an
independent investigation of the business, operations, technology, assets,
prospects, financial condition, liabilities, results of operations and
projected operations of the Business and the nature and condition of its
properties, assets and businesses and, in making the determination to proceed
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, has relied solely on the results of its own independent
investigation and the representations and warranties set forth in _ARTICLE
III_ or any Ancillary Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that Seller and the
Acquired Entities have provided Buyer with access to the personnel,
properties, premises and books and records of the Business. In entering into
this Agreement, Buyer has relied solely upon its own investigation
and analysis, and Buyer acknowledges that none of Seller, the Acquired
Entities or their respective Affiliates nor any other Person has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information (including any projections, estimates or
other forward-looking information) regarding Seller, the Acquired Entities or

limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as expressly and
specifically covered by a representation and warranty set forth in _ARTICLE
III_ or any Ancillary Agreement, none of Seller, the Acquired Entities or

warranty to Buyer regarding the accuracy or completeness of, or otherwise
with respect to, (i) any projections, forecasts, plans, estimates or budgets
for the Business or (ii) any material, documents or information relating to
the Seller or the Acquired Entities made available to Buyer or its
Representatives in any "data room", offering memorandum, information
memorandum or otherwise. Buyer agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
that Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives shall not
have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to Buyer or its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Representatives on any basis (including in contract
or tort, under federal or state securities laws or otherwise) based upon any
information provided or made available, or statements made (or any omissions
therefrom), to Buyer or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives, including in respect of the specific representations and
warranties of the Seller set forth in _ARTICLE III_ of this Agreement

 



75  or any Ancillary Agreement, except as and only to the extent expressly set
forth herein or therein with respect to such representations and warranties
and subject to the limitations and restrictions contained herein or therein.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller makes no
representation or warranty with respect to, and nothing contained in this
Agreement (including ARTICLE III hereof), in the Ancillary Agreements or in
any other agreement, document or instrument to be delivered in connection
herewith or therewith is intended or shall be construed to be a representation
or warranty (express or implied) of the Seller, for any purpose of this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any other agreement, document
or instrument to be delivered in connection herewith or therewith, in respect
of: (i) the adequacy or sufficiency of any reserves of the Business or of the
Acquired Entities; (ii) whether or not the reserves specified in clause (i)
above were determined in accordance with any actuarial, statutory or other
standard, or concerning the effect of the adequacy or sufficiency of reserves
on any "line item" or asset, liability or equity amount, or the effect of any
"line item" or asset, liability or equity amount on the adequacy or
sufficiency of reserves; and (iii) any financial reports, statements and data
delivered or made available to Buyer between the date hereof and the Closing
Date.

 

Section 9.2 _Choice of Law_. This Agreement, and all claims, disputes,
controversies or causes of action (whether in contract, tort, equity or
otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement
(including any schedule or exhibit hereto) or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any claim, dispute, controversy or
cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement
to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws, and not the Laws governing conflicts of
Laws (other than Sections 5-1401 and 5-1402 of the New York General
Obligations Law), of the State of New York.

 

Section 9.3 _Dispute Resolution_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
2.4_, _Section 5.17_ and  _Section 9.12_, from and after the Closing, any
claim, dispute, controversy or causes of action arising out of, relating to or
in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (including any
schedule or exhibit hereto and thereto), or the breach, termination or
validity hereof or thereof, or the negotiation, execution or performance
hereof or thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, in each
case whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether in contract,
tort, equity or otherwise (a "Dispute") shall be resolved as set forth in this
_Section 9.3_:

 

(a) The parties shall first attempt to settle such Dispute in the first
instance by mutual discussions between representatives of senior management
of each party. Within five Business Days of the receipt by a party or parties
of a notice from another party or parties of the existence of a Dispute (the
"Dispute Notice"), the receiving party or parties shall submit a written
response to the other party or parties (the "Response"). Both the Dispute
Notice and the Response shall include: (i) a statement of each disputing
partys position with regard to the Dispute and a summary of arguments
supporting that position; and (ii) the name and title of the senior executive
who will represent that party in attempting to resolve the Dispute pursuant to
this _Section 9.3(a)_. Within five Business Days of receipt of the Response,
the

 



76  designated executives shall meet or communicate by telephone and attempt to
resolve the Dispute. Subject to any disclosure requirements of applicable Law,
all negotiations pursuant to this clause shall be confidential and shall be
treated as compromise and settlement negotiations, and no oral or documentary
representations made by the parties during such negotiations shall be
admissible for any purpose in any subsequent proceedings. If any Dispute is
not resolved within 20 days of receipt of the Dispute Notice (or within such
longer period as to which the parties have agreed in writing), then either
party may pursue the remedy provided for in _Section 9.3(b)_.

 

(b) Any Dispute not timely resolved in accordance with _Section 9.3(a)_ may
be submitted by any party to the federal or state courts located in New York,
New York (the "New York Courts"). By executing and delivering this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto irrevocably: (i) accepts generally and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Courts
for any Action arising from any Dispute, including for any Action for a
preliminary injunction to maintain the status quo or prevent irreparable harm
during the negotiations pursuant to _Section 9.3(a)_; (ii) waives any
objections which such party may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any such Action contemplated by this _Section 9.3(b)_ and hereby further
irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim that any such Action has
been brought in an inconvenient forum; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt
to deny or defeat the personal jurisdiction of the New York Courts by motion
or other request for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that it will not
bring any Action contemplated by this _Section 9.3(b)_ in any court other
than the New York Courts; (v) agrees that service of all process, including
the summons and complaint, in any Action may be made by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, to such party at their respective
addresses provided in accordance with _Section 9.4_ or in any other manner
permitted by Law; and (vi) agrees that service as provided in the preceding
clause (v) is sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over such party in
the Action, and otherwise constitutes effective and binding service in every
respect. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any Action
in a New York Court as provided above may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law, and each party
further agrees to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Courts for
the enforcement or execution of any such judgment.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 9.3_, for the
avoidance of doubt the parties agree that this _Section 9.3_ shall not
impact or interfere with the provisions of _Section 8.4_ hereof (it being
understood that any Dispute with respect to an Indemnified Partys entitlement
to indemnification under  _ARTICLE VIII_ shall be subject to the provisions
of this _Section 9.3_) or the ability of a party to obtain specific
performance as contemplated by _Section 9.12_.

 

Section 9.4 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications
under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been
duly given when delivered personally, when sent by facsimile or via electronic
mail (with a notice contemporaneously given by another method specified in
this _Section 9.4_), when sent by overnight courier service or when mailed
by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, with postage

granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligations, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

 

Section 9.11 _Third-party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and, except for
_Section 5.18_, nothing herein express or implied shall give or be construed
to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and such permitted
assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder. This Agreement may only be
enforced against the named parties hereto. All claims or causes of action
(whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of
this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement), may be made only against the entities that are expressly
identified as parties hereto, and no officer, director, owner, employee or
Affiliate of any party hereto (including any Person negotiating or executing
this Agreement on behalf of a party hereto) shall have any liability or
obligation with respect to this Agreement or with respect to any claim or
cause of action (whether in contract or tort) that may arise out of or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement (including a representation or warranty made in or in connection
with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement).

Section 9.12 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree and acknowledge that the failure to perform under this
Agreement will cause an actual, immediate and irreparable harm and injury and
that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached prior to the
Closing. Accordingly, it is agreed that, except where this Agreement is
properly terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE VII_ , (i) each of the parties
hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other party prior to the
Closing and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and any other agreement or instrument executed in connection herewith, and
(ii) damages shall be awarded only in a case where a court of competent
jurisdiction shall have determined that, notwithstanding the parties
intention for specific performance to be the applicable remedy prior to
termination or the Closing, such specific performance is not available or
otherwise will not be granted as a remedy.

(b) The parties further agree that (A) by seeking the remedies provided
for in this _Section 9.12_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right
to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this
Agreement, including monetary damages in the event that this Agreement has
been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this
_Section 9.12_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (B)
nothing contained in this _Section 9.12_ shall require any party to institute
any proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any proceeding
for) specific performance under this _Section 9.12_ before exercising any
termination right under _Section 7.1_ (and pursuing damages after
such termination), nor shall the commencement of any Action pursuant to this
_Section 9.12_ or anything contained in this _Section 9.12_ restrict or
limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms 

 



80  of _Section 7.1_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may
be available then or thereafter.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably (i) accepts generally and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Courts
for any Action brought for any remedy contemplated by this _Section 9.12_;
(ii) waives any objections which such party may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such Action and hereby further irrevocably waives and
agrees not to plead or claim that any such Action has been brought in an
inconvenient forum; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
the personal jurisdiction of the New York Courts by motion or other request
for leave from any such court; (iv) agrees that it will not bring any Action
for any remedy contemplated by this _Section 9.12_ in any court other than
the New York Courts; (v) agrees that service of all process, including
the summons and complaint, in any Action may be made by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, to such party at their respective
addresses provided in accordance with _Section 9.4_ or in any other manner
permitted by Law; and (vi) agrees that service as provided in the preceding
clause (v) is sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over such party in
the Action, and otherwise constitutes effective and binding service in every
respect. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
Action in a New York Court may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law, and each party further
agrees to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Courts for the
enforcement or execution of any such judgment.

(d) To the extent either party hereto brings any Action to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and any other agreement or instrument executed in connection
herewith in accordance with this _Section 9.12_, the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such Action
is pending, plus 20 Business Days, or (ii) such other time period established
by the court presiding over such Action.

 

Section 9.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. THE PARTIES HEREBY UNCONDITIONALLY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING IN
ANY COURT RELATING TO ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF,
RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING ANY SCHEDULE OR EXHIBIT HERETO AND THERETO) OR THE
BREACH, TERMINATION OR VALIDITY OF SUCH AGREEMENTS OR THE NEGOTIATION,
EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE OF SUCH AGREEMENTS.

Section 9.14  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision hereof. Upon such determination, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to give effect to
the original intent of the parties hereto to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law.

Section 9.15 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may
be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed, shall
be deemed to be an

 



81  original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same
instrument binding upon all of the parties hereto notwithstanding the fact
that all parties are not signatory to the original or the same counterpart.
For purposes of this Agreement, facsimile signatures shall be deemed
originals, and the parties agree to exchange original signatures as promptly
as possible.

 

Section 9.16 _No Right of Setoff_. No party hereto nor any Affiliate thereof
may deduct from, set off, holdback or otherwise reduce in any manner
whatsoever any amount owed to it hereunder or pursuant to any Ancillary
Agreement against any amounts owed hereunder or pursuant to any Ancillary
Agreement by such Persons to the other party hereto or any of such
other partys Affiliates.

Section 9.17 _Bulk Transfer Laws_. Buyer acknowledges that Seller will not
comply with the provisions of the bulk transfer Laws of any jurisdiction in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 9.18 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Non-Assertion of
Attorney Client Privilege_. Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to
cause the Acquired Entities to waive and to not assert, any conflict of
interest arising out of or relating to any representation, after the Closing,
of Seller, any Seller, any Acquired Entity or any Affiliate of Seller or any
Seller, or any of their respective officers, employees, directors or managers
in any matter involving this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including
any litigation, arbitration, mediation or other proceeding), by any legal
counsel that has represented any such party prior the Closing. Buyer waives
and will not assert, and agrees to cause the Acquired Entities and each of
their other Affiliates to waive and to not assert, any attorney-client
privilege with respect to any communication that relates to negotiation of the
Agreement, or any Ancillary Agreement, disputes arising from the Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, Retained Liabilities or Excluded Assets, the content
or preparation of the Disclosure Schedules or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby if that communication occurred on
or prior to the Closing between any legal counsel and Seller, any Seller, the
Acquired Entities or any Affiliate of Seller or any Seller, or any of their
respective officers, employees, directors and managers, it being the intention
of the parties that all such rights to such attorney-client privilege and
to control such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by Seller, its
Affiliates, and their respective officers, employees, directors or managers.

 

Section 9.19 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. This Agreement and the rights
hereunder are not assignable unless such assignment is consented to in
writing by both Buyer and Seller and, subject to the preceding clause, this
Agreement and all the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.
