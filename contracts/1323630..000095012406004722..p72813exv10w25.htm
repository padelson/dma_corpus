The Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Returns for the Company related to Income Tax for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date. The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Returns (other than Returns related to Income Tax) for the Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date.

The Purchaser shall permit the Seller Representative at least twenty (20) Business Days during which to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence prior to filing. For purposes of this Section, in the case of any Straddle Period, as defined below, the portion of any Tax which relates to the portion of such Taxable period ending on the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Portion_ ") shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Taxable period, any (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though the relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date. 

  

 (c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Purchaser, the Company and the Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Returns pursuant to this Section 5.14 and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient 

   ##### 

  

    

basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. The Parties agree (i) to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Purchaser or the Sellers,
any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by
all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing authority, and
(ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party
so requests, the Company or the Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the
other Party to take possession of such books and records. 

  

 (d) The Sellers, severally, in proportion to their holdings of Polk Stock on the Closing Date, and not jointly, agree to indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates, including, after the Closing, the Company and each Subsidiary (each herein sometimes referred to as an "Indemnified Taxpayer") harmless from and against and shall reimburse each Indemnified Taxpayer for, any and all Taxes or other expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and reasonable attorneys and accountants fees and expenses in connection with any action, suit or proceeding) actually incurred, suffered or accrued at any time by any Indemnified Taxpayer (all herein referred to as " _Tax Losses_ ") arising out of or attributable to, without duplication: 

  

 (i) any liability for the Taxes of Company and/or any Subsidiary for any period ending on or before the Closing Date and the Pre-Closing Portion of any Tax period commencing before the Closing Date and not ending on the Closing Date (the " _Straddle Period_ "), reduced by (A) in the case of any Tax other than a federal Income Tax, any liability accrual or reserve for that type of Tax as of the Closing Date (excluding any amount to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the Financial Statements and (B) any liability for a Tax imposed as a result of a violation by Purchaser or the Company of the covenant set forth in Section 5.14(h) below; 

   

 (ii) all liabilities of the Company and/or any Subsidiary as a result of the applicability of Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-6 or otherwise for Taxes of any other corporation affiliated with the Company on or prior to the Closing Date; and 

   

 (iii) all Tax liabilities of the Company and/or any Subsidiary as a result of the distribution by the Company of the stock and interests in Polk Mexico and Polk Investments for any period ending on the Closing Date or the Pre-Closing Period of any Straddle Period. 

   

 Subject to the resolution of any Tax contest pursuant to _Section 5.14(e)_, upon notice from Purchaser to the Seller Representative that an Indemnified Taxpayer is entitled to an indemnification payment for a Tax Loss pursuant to this _Section 5.14(d)_, Sellers shall thereupon pay to the Indemnified Taxpayer the amount of the Tax Loss, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if it is determined upon resolution of the Tax contest by a Government Entity that Purchaser was not entitled to indemnification hereunder, Purchaser shall repay to Sellers all amounts Sellers paid to Purchaser for indemnification hereunder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) If a claim shall be made by any taxing authority that, if successful, would result in the indemnification of an Indemnified Taxpayer, the Indemnified Taxpayer shall, within 15 Business Days, notify the Seller Representative in writing of such fact; _provided_ , _however_ , that any failure to give such notice will not waive any rights of the Indemnified Taxpayer except to the extent the rights of the indemnifying party are actually materially prejudiced. 

  

 (i) Sellers shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Taxpayer against such claim with counsel of their choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Taxpayer so long as (A) Sellers notify the Indemnified Taxpayer in writing within 15 Business Days after the Indemnified Taxpayer has given notice of such claim that Sellers will indemnify the Indemnified Taxpayer as required hereunder, (B) Sellers provide the Indemnified Taxpayer with evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Taxpayer that Sellers will have the financial resources to defend against the claim and fulfill their indemnification obligations hereunder, (C) if requested by the Indemnified Taxpayer, Sellers provide to the Indemnified Taxpayer an opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Taxpayer, of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Taxpayer, that there exists a reasonable basis for the Company to prevail in that contest, (D) if the Indemnified Taxpayer is requested to pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund, Sellers shall have advanced to the Indemnified Taxpayer, on an interest free basis, the full amount the Indemnified Taxpayer is required to pay, and (E) Sellers conduct the defense of the claim actively and diligently. 

   

 (ii) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (i) above, Sellers shall be entitled to prosecute such contest to a determination in a court of initial jurisdiction, and if Sellers shall reasonably request, to a determination in an appellate court provided that, if requested by the Indemnified Taxpayer, Sellers shall provide to the Indemnified Taxpayer an opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Taxpayer, of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Taxpayer, that there exists a reasonable basis for the Company to prevail on that appeal. 

   

 (iii) Sellers shall not be entitled to settle or to contest any claim relating to Taxes if the settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the claim would be likely, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnified Taxpayer, to cause the liability for any Tax of the Indemnified Taxpayer or of any Affiliate of the Indemnified Taxpayer for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date to increase (including, without limitation, by making any election or taking any action having the effect of making any election, by deferring the inclusion of any amount in income or by accelerating the deduction of any amount or the claiming of any credit) or to take a position that, if applied to any taxable period ending after the Closing Date, would be adverse to the interest of the Indemnified Taxpayer or any Affiliate of the Indemnified Taxpayer. 

   

 (iv) If, after actual receipt by the Indemnified Taxpayer of an amount advanced by Sellers pursuant to paragraph (i)(D) above, the extent of the liability of the Indemnified Taxpayer with respect to the indemnified matter shall be established by the judgment or decree of a court that has become final or a binding settlement with an administrative agency having jurisdiction thereof that has become final, the Indemnified Taxpayer shall promptly pay to Sellers any refund received by or credited to the Indemnified Taxpayer with respect to the indemnified matter (together with any interest paid or credited   ##### 

  

  

  

thereon by the taxing authority and any recovery of legal fees from such
taxing authority). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Taxpayer
shall not be required to make any payment hereunder before such time as
Sellers shall have made all payments or indemnities then due with respect to
the Indemnified Taxpayer pursuant to this _Section 5.14_. 

   

 (v) If any of the conditions in _Section 5.14(e)(i)_ above are or become unsatisfied, (A) the Indemnified Taxpayer may defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to, the claim in any manner it may deem appropriate (and the Indemnified Taxpayer need not thereafter consult with, or obtain any consent from, any Seller in connection therewith), (B) Sellers will reimburse the Indemnified Taxpayer promptly and periodically for the costs of defending against the claim (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys, accountants and experts fees and disbursements) and (C) Sellers will remain responsible for any Tax Losses the Indemnified Taxpayer may suffer to the fullest extent provided in this _Section 5.14_. 

   

 (f) The indemnification obligations of Sellers under this _Section 5._14 shall survive the Closing until the end of the applicable statutes of limitations. With respect to any indemnification obligation for any Tax for which a taxing authority asserts a claim within 90 days before the end of the foregoing survival period, an Indemnified Taxpayer shall be treated as having provided timely notice to the Seller Representative by providing written notice to the Seller Representative on or before the 45th day after the Indemnified Taxpayers receipt of a written assertion of the claim by the taxing authority. 

  

 (g) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid one-half by Purchaser and one-half by the Sellers when due, and Purchaser shall cause the Company, at its own expense, to file all necessary Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees. If required by applicable law, Sellers will join in the execution of any such Returns and other documentation. 

  

 (h) Neither Purchaser, the Company nor any of their respective Affiliates shall make any election under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (i) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Parties agree that any indemnification payments (and/or payments or adjustments) made with respect to this Agreement shall be treated for all Tax purposes as adjustments to the Purchase Price. Any indemnification obligations of the Sellers pursuant to this _Section 5.14_ for Taxes other than federal Income Taxes shall be satisfied first out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund to the extent thereof. 

  

 (j) Any federal Income Tax refunds that are received by Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary and any amounts credited against federal Income Tax to which Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary become entitled, which relate to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date or to the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period, shall, to the extent they exceed the amounts of anticipated federal Income Tax refunds included as receivables on 

   ##### 

  

    

the Financial Statements, be for the account of the Sellers, and Purchaser
shall pay over to the Seller Representative any such excess within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt thereof.

 (i) Without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, the Covenanters, and each of them, shall not for a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date (A) directly or indirectly, except as otherwise permitted hereunder, acquire or own in any manner any interest in any Person, firm, partnership, corporation, association or other entity which engages or which Covenanter has reasonable cause to believe will engage in any facet of the Business or which competes or which Covenanter has reasonable cause to believe will compete in any way with the Business, anywhere in the world (the " _Territory_ "), (B) be employed by or serve as an employee, agent, officer, director of, or as a consultant to, any Person, firm, partnership, corporation, association or other entity which engages or which Covenanter has reasonable cause to believe will engage in any facet of the Business or which competes or which Covenanter has reasonable cause to believe will compete in any way with the Business within the Territory, provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prevent a Covenanter from performing services for a competitive business if such competitive business is also engaged in other lines of business and (I) if the services of a Covenanter are restricted to employment in such other lines of business and (II) the net revenues of the competitive business represent less than 10% of the Companys net revenues, or (C) utilize his special knowledge of the Business and/or his relationships with customers, suppliers and others to compete with the Business of the Company as constituted on the Closing Date; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.15_ shall be deemed to prevent (1) a Covenanter from acquiring through market purchases and owning, solely as an investment, less than five percent in the aggregate of the equity securities of any class of any issuer whose shares are registered under §12(b) or 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are listed or admitted for trading on any United States national securities exchange or are quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System, or any similar system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices in common use, so long as such Covenanter is not a member of any "control group" (within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission) of any such issuer, (2) the purchase of an interest in a competing business, public or private, if the interest is acquired passively and indirectly by an entity in which Covenanter has less than a 3% interest (for example, in a private equity or mutual fund investment) as long as Covenanter has no involvement in the management of such investment and plays a passive role with respect to such investment, (3) the continued ownership of an interest in a competing business that was acquired prior to that firm engaging in or giving Covenanter reasonable cause to believe that they would engage in competition with the Purchaser. Each Covenanter acknowledges and agrees that the covenants provided for in this  _Section 5.15(a)_ are reasonable and necessary in terms of time, area and line of business to protect the Companys Intellectual Property. Each Covenanter further 

    ##### 

  

    

acknowledges and agrees that such covenants are reasonable and necessary in
terms of time, area and line of business to protect the Companys legitimate
business interests, which include its interests in protecting the Companys
(i) valuable confidential business information, (ii) substantial
relationships with customers throughout the world, and (iii) customer
goodwill associated with the ongoing business of the Company. Each Covenanter
expressly authorizes the enforcement of the covenants provided for in this
_Section 5.15(a)_ by (A) the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, (B) the
Purchasers permitted assigns, and (C) any successors to the Companys or the
Purchasers business. To the extent that the covenants provided for in this
_Section 5.15(a)_ may later be deemed by a court to be too broad to be
enforced with respect to its duration or with respect to any particular
activity or geographic area, the court making such determination shall have
the power to reduce the duration or scope of the provision, and to add
or delete specific words or phrases to or from the provision. The provision
as modified shall then be enforced. 

   

 (ii) Without the prior consent of the Purchaser, such Covenanter shall not for a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, for himself or for any other Person, firm, corporation, partnership, association or other entity, (A) attempt to employ or enter into any contractual arrangement with any employee or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, unless such employee or former employee has not been employed by the Company or any Subsidiary for a period in excess of nine months, _provided_ , _however_ , that general, non-targeted public advertisements and solicitations shall not be prohibited by this clause, and/or (B) call on or solicit any of the actual or targeted prospective customers or clients of the Company or any Subsidiary for purposes of soliciting such customers or clients to purchase products which compete with those of the Company or Purchaser, nor shall such Covenanter make known the names and addresses of such customers or any information relating in any manner to the Companys or any Subsidiarys trade or business relationships with such customers. 

   

 (iii) Such Covenanter shall not at any time within a period of five (5) years from the later of the Closing Date or five (5) years from the termination of his affiliation with the Company as an employee or consultant divulge, communicate, use to the detriment of the Company or for the benefit of any other Person or Persons, or misuse in any way, any confidential information pertaining to the Company or any Subsidiary. Any confidential information or data now known or hereafter acquired by such Covenanter with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary shall be deemed a valuable, special and unique asset of the Company that is received by such Covenanter in confidence. For the purposes of the foregoing, confidential information shall not include information that generally becomes available to the public, other than as a result of disclosure by a Covenanter in violation of this Section 5.15. 

   

 (b) _Injunction_. It is recognized and hereby acknowledged by the parties hereto that a breach or violation by a Covenanter of any or all of the covenants and agreements contained in this  _Section 5.15_ may cause irreparable harm and damage to the Purchaser in a monetary amount which may be virtually impossible to ascertain. As a result, each Covenanter recognizes and hereby acknowledges that the Purchaser shall be entitled to an injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining and restraining any breach or violation of any or all of the covenants and agreements contained in this _Section 5.15_ by such Covenanter and/or his agents, either directly or indirectly, and that such right to injunction shall be cumulative and 

   ##### 

  

    

in addition to whatever other rights or remedies the Purchaser may possess
hereunder, at law or in equity. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.15_
shall be construed to prevent Purchaser from seeking and recovering from a
Covenanter damages sustained by Purchaser as a result of any breach or
violation by such Covenanter of any of the covenants or agreements
contained herein. 

  

 (c) _Disclosure Required by Law_. If Covenanter receives a request to disclose all or any part of the confidential information under the terms of a subpoena or order issued by a Government Entity, Covenanter agrees timely to notify Purchaser of the existence, terms, and circumstances surrounding such request, to consult with Purchaser on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request; and, if disclosure of such confidential information is required to prevent Covenanter from being held in contempt or subject to other penalty, to furnish only such portion of the confidential information as, in the written opinion of Covenanters counsel, Covenanter is legally compelled to disclose, and to exercise Covenanters reasonable efforts to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the disclosed confidential information. Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Covenanter for all reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in complying with the terms of this subsection. 

  

Section 5.16 _Public Announcements_  

   

 None of the Company and the Sellers, on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall make, or permit any agent or Affiliate to make any public statements, including, without limitation, any press releases, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the other, except as may be required by law. The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers and the Company, on the other hand, shall jointly agree on the timing, content and substance of all public announcements concerning the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

Section 5.17 _Litigation Support_  

   

 In the event and for so long as any Party actively is contesting or defending against any third party action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in connection with (a) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement, or (b) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving the Sellers, the Company or the Purchaser, the Parties agree to (i) cooperate with the contesting or defending Party and its counsel, (ii) make available its employees to provide testimony, to be deposed, to act as witnesses and to assist counsel, and (iii) provide access to its books and records as shall be necessary in connection with the defense or contest, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under _Article VI_ below). 

   ##### 

  

  

Section 5.18 _Transaction Expenses_  

   

 Each of the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Sellers and the Company, on the other hand, shall bear their own costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall pay and discharge all of its costs and expenses prior to Closing. 

  

 Section 5.19 _Post-Closing Company Executive Compensation and Short- and Long-Term Incentive Compensation Arrangements_  

  

 From and after the Closing, certain Polk management employees as determined by James M. Herd and approved by Purchasers President (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) shall be entitled to participate in the executive compensation and short- and long-term incentive arrangements described in the attached _Exhibit G_. 

  

Section 5.20 _Replacement LCs_  

   

 At or prior to Closing, Purchaser shall provide substitute LCs or alternative security reasonably acceptable to the Sellers for LCs outstanding on the Closing Date.

Under the terms of the GE Mortgages, no amendments to or assignments of the Leases are valid or binding unless first approved by GE, and GE may grant or withhold its consent to lease amendments or assignments in its sole discretion. The term "commercially reasonable efforts" as used in this context shall not be construed to include (a) voluntary prepayment in whole or in part, (b) the pledging of additional collateral, or (iii) the addition of personal guarantees or other credit enhancements with respect to the GE Mortgages. 

  

Section 5.22 _Employment Agreements with Polk and Klopfer_

 (a) the breach by the Sellers (or the Company with respect to the period prior to the Closing Date) of any of the covenants made by the Sellers (or the Company with respect to the period prior to the Closing Date) in this Agreement; 

  

 (b) the breach of any of the representations and warranties made by the Sellers or the Company in this Agreement (it being agreed that, for purposes of this _Section 6.2(b)_, all qualifications and exceptions contained in the representations and warranties set forth in  _Articles III_ and _IV_ relating to materiality, Material Adverse Change, Material Adverse Effect, or words of similar import shall be disregarded), _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Sellers are given an Indemnification Claim Notice during the applicable survival period specified in _Section 6.1_ above; 

  

 (c) the Delphi claim (hereafter defined); and

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification with respect to a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement if and to the extent that Troy D. Templeton, James E. Minarik, Jon E. Elias or Kevin P. Duffy had actual knowledge prior to the date hereof of the events or conditions constituting or resulting in 

   ##### 

  

    

such breach of representation or warranty and could reasonably have

Section 6.3 _Indemnification Obligations of the Purchaser_  

   

 Subject to the provisions of _Section 6.4_ below, the Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their respective Affiliates, stockholders, officers, managers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the " _Sellers Indemnitees_ ") in respect of any Loss which any Sellers Indemnitee suffers, sustains or becomes subject to as a result of or by virtue of, without duplication:

Section 6.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_  

   

 (a) No party shall be entitled to assert any claim for indemnification pursuant to  _Sections 6.2(b)_ or _6.3(b)_ above unless and until the amount of the Losses sustained by such party with respect to any individual matter exceeds $20,000. In addition, no party shall be obligated to indemnify another party with respect to any Losses pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ as to which a party is otherwise entitled to assert any claim for indemnification unless and until the aggregate amount of the Losses attributable to the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Sellers Indemnitees, as the case may be, exceeds $1,360,000.00 (the " _Basket Amount_ "); and then only to the excess of, but not including, the Basket Amount. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum aggregate obligation of the Sellers pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)_ shall not exceed $6,800,000.00; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither the limitations provided by the first two sentences of this  _Section 6.4(a)_ nor such maximum obligation shall apply to Losses caused by breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 2.1_ (Organization; Corporate Power and Authorization), _3.1_ (Authorization), _3.3_ (Capital Stock), _4.1_  (Organization; Qualification and Corporate Power), _4.3_ (Capitalization; Subsidiaries) and  _4.10_ (Tax Matters) above, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the limitations provided by the first and second sentences of this _Section 6.4(a)_ shall not apply to any Loss suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees resulting from a possible preference claim (the " _Delphi Claim_ ") by Delco Electronics Corporation or its Affiliates or trustee representing any of them against the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with payments made under the Settlement and Release Agreement dated July 1, 2005 between the Company and Delphi Electronics Corporation or from the Lease Loss. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) In calculating the amount of Losses suffered or incurred by a party for which indemnification is sought hereunder there shall be deducted the amount of any insurance paid to such party or otherwise actually inuring to the benefit of such party as a result of any such Loss, it being agreed that each Party shall use reasonable commercial efforts to mitigate such Loss and to use reasonable commercial efforts to pursue insurance claims in connection therewith. 

  

 (c) The foregoing indemnification provisions shall be the sole and exclusive remedy and procedure for all claims for breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation. 

  

Section 6.5 _Indemnification Procedures_  

   

 (a) _Notice of Claim_. Any Person making a claim for indemnification pursuant to  _Sections 6.2_ or _6.3_ above (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") must give the Party from whom indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice of such claim, containing a description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss is known at such time) (an " _Indemnification Claim Notice_ "), promptly after the Indemnified Party receives any written notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim against or involving the Indemnified Party by a Government Entity or other third Person or otherwise discovers the liability, obligation or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification (it being understood that any claim for indemnity pursuant to _Sections 6.2(b)_ or _6.3(b)_ above must be made by notice given within the applicable survival period specified in _Section 6.1_ above). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its or his obligations to provide indemnification hereunder except to the extent such failure shall have harmed the Indemnifying Party. 

  

 (b) _Control of Defense; Conditions_. The obligations of an Indemnifying Party under this _Article VI_ with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party that are subject to the indemnification provided in _Sections 6.2_ or _6.3_ above shall be governed by and contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions: 

  

 (i) At its option an Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume control of the defense of any claim and may appoint as lead counsel of such defense any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Indemnification Claim Notice to Indemnifying Party, notify the Indemnified Party of its intention as to the conduct and control of the defense of such claim. Until the Indemnified Party has received notice of the Indemnifying Partys election whether to defend any claim, the Indemnified Party may take reasonable steps to defend (but may not settle) such claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall decline to assume the defense of any such claim, or the Indemnifying Party shall fail to notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after delivery of the Indemnification Claim Notice of the Indemnifying Partys election to defend such claim, the Indemnified Party shall defend against such claim. Regardless of which Party shall assume the defense of the claim, the Parties agree to cooperate fully with one another in connection therewith and to keep each other reasonably informed of the status of the claim and any related proceeding and shall take no 

    ##### 

  

    

action or make any admissions or statements not required by applicable law
which would adversely effect the defense of any such claim. 

   

 (ii) Notwithstanding _Section 6.5(b)(i)_ above, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such employment shall be at the Indemnified Partys own expense unless (A) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, or (B) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (following delivery of the Indemnification Claim Notice), in which case the fees and expenses of the Indemnified Partys counsel shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (iii) The Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any third party claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld, conditioned or delayed unreasonably), and the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any third party claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be withheld, conditioned or delayed unreasonably). 

   

 (c) _Manner of Payment_. 

  

 (i) Any indemnification obligations of the Sellers pursuant to _Section 6.2_ above shall be satisfied first out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to the extent thereof. 

   

 (ii) Any indemnification obligations of the Purchaser pursuant to _Section 6.3_ above shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the Seller Representative on behalf of the applicable Seller Indemnitees within fifteen (15) days after the determination thereof. 

   

 (d) _Escrow Agreement and Holdback Amount_  

  

 At Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver an amount equal to $6,800,000.00 (the " _Indemnity Escrow Fund_ ") to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), as security for any amounts owed to the Purchaser pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in  _Section 6.2_ above. The Indemnity Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent for 12 months pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Article VI and the Indemnity Escrow Agreement attached as _Exhibit A_ hereto. 

  

 (e) _Instructions to Escrow Agent_. In the event of a determination that a payment is due to any Purchaser Indemnitee, the Purchaser and the Seller Representative shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to distribute a portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund equal to such payment.

BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ACTION. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE PROPER IN SUCH COURT, AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT SUCH COURT IS AN IMPROPER OR INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH ACTION. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THE MAILING BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, OF ANY PROCESS REQUIRED BY SUCH COURT SHALL CONSTITUTE VALID AND LAWFUL SERVICE OF PROCESS AGAINST THEM, WITHOUT NECESSITY FOR SERVICE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PROVIDED BY STATUTE OR RULE OF COURT. 

  

Section 9.18. _Seller Representative_  

   

 (a) The Sellers irrevocably make, constitute and appoint the Seller Representative as their agent and authorize and empower him to fulfill the role of Seller Representative hereunder. In the event of the resignation of a Seller Representative, the resigning Seller Representative shall appoint a successor who shall agree in writing to accept such appointment, and the resigning Seller Representatives resignation shall not be effective until such a successor shall exist. The Sellers holding a majority of the Polk Stock on the date hereof (a " _Majority Interest_ ") may remove and replace the Seller Representative at any time, _provided_ , _however_ , that such replacement Seller Representative shall be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser. If a Seller Representative should die or become incapacitated or be removed by the Sellers pursuant to this  _Section 9.18_, his successor shall be appointed within twenty-one (21) days after his death or incapacity by the Sellers holding a Majority Interest, and such successor shall be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser. If the Sellers fail to appoint a successor within such 21-day period, then Purchaser shall have the right to appoint the successor from among the Sellers. The choice of a successor Seller Representative appointed in any manner permitted above shall be final and binding upon all of the Sellers and the Purchaser. The decisions and actions of any successor Seller Representative shall be, for all purposes, those of a Seller Representative as if originally named herein. 

  

 (b) By the execution of this Agreement, each Seller hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Seller Representative as such persons true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent, for such person and in such persons name, (i) to receive all notices and communications directed to such Seller under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents, (ii) to execute and deliver any and all documents required to be executed and delivered by such Seller pursuant to this Agreement in order to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) to receive and provide receipt for all consideration required to be delivered to such Seller under this Agreement, (iv) to perform any and all actions required to be taken by such Seller in connection with any claim for indemnity pursuant to the provisions of _Article VI_ 

   ##### 

  

 

above and (v) to execute and deliver all instruments and documents of every
kind incident to the foregoing to all intents and purposes and with the same
effect as such Seller could do personally, and each Seller hereby ratifies
and confirms as his, her or its own act, all that the Seller Representative
shall do or cause to be done pursuant to the provisions hereof. 
_Notwithstanding the foregoing, except with respect to administrative and
other ministerial tasks, the Seller Representative is required and entitled
to act only at the written direction of Sellers holding a Majority
Interest_. 

   

 (c) It is acknowledged by the Sellers appointing the Seller Representative that the designation of the Seller Representative as attorney-in-fact is coupled with an interest and is binding upon such Sellers notwithstanding the death, incapacity or dissolution of any such Seller. If any such event shall occur prior to the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Seller Representative is, nevertheless, to the extent that he is legally able to do so, authorized and directed to complete all transactions and act pursuant to this authority as if such event had not occurred. Purchaser is entitled to deal solely with the Seller Representative in connection with this Agreement and is entitled to rely upon the provisions hereof and the authority granted to the Seller Representative to act on behalf of the Sellers. 

  

 (d) The Seller Representatives acceptance of his duties under this Agreement is subject to the following terms and conditions, which the Parties hereto agree shall govern and control with respect to his rights, duties, liabilities and immunities as Seller Representative (but not in his capacity as a Seller or as an officer, director, or employee of the Company): 

   

 (i) The Seller Representative, in his capacity as Seller Representative, makes no representation and has no responsibility as to the validity of this Agreement or of any other instrument referred to herein, or as to the correctness of any statement contained herein, and he shall not be required to inquire as to the performance of any obligation under this Agreement. 

   

 (ii) The Seller Representative shall be protected in acting upon written notice, request, waiver, consent, receipt or other paper or document, not only as to its due execution and the validity and effectiveness of its provisions, but also as to the truth of any information therein contained, which he in good faith believes to be genuine and what it purports to be. 

   

 (iii) The Seller Representative, in his capacity as Seller Representative, shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or for any act done or step taken or omitted by him in good faith, or for any mistake of fact or law, or for anything which he may do or refrain from doing in connection therewith, except his own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

   

 (iv) The Seller Representative, in his capacity as Seller Representative, may consult with competent and responsible legal counsel selected by him, and he shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by him in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (v) The Sellers shall bear, in proportion to their holdings of Polk Stock on the date hereof, all expenses, if any (including transfer taxes and other governmental charges) incurred by the Seller Representative in connection with his duties hereunder and shall indemnify and hold him harmless against any and all Losses incurred in connection with the performance of this Agreement, except as a result of his own gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

  

 (e) The Seller Representative, in his capacity as Seller Representative, shall have no duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein.
