collectively constitute, and as of the Closing Date will constitute, one
hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding share capital or other equity
interests in the Company, and the Sellers agree to sell and transfer such
Shares to the Purchaser, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than
Encumbrances arising under applicable corporation or securities Law, due to
the status of the Purchaser or from any actions taken by the Purchaser. Seller
S.a.r.l. further agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to procure and
cause the sale by Seller AS of the Shares contemplated to be sold hereunder by
Seller AS on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. In the
event both Sellers are obligated hereunder to consummate such purchase and
sale of the Shares and Seller AS does not timely consummate such purchase and
sale in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, Seller S.a.r.l, in its
capacity as shareholder of the Company, as Seller Representative or otherwise,
shall assist and cooperate with, and take all actions reasonably requested by,
the Purchaser to seek to cause Seller AS's compliance with its obligations
hereunder, including using its reasonable best efforts to take actions (or
cause action to be taken) or enforce rights (or cause rights to be enforced)
under the Investment Agreement and/or the ManagementCo Investment Agreement or
other applicable Contracts or Law (including commencing and prosecuting
litigation). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Purchaser be
required to consummate the purchase of Shares from any individual Seller
unless it is consummating the purchase of all Shares from all of the Sellers.
Each Seller hereby irrevocably waives any preemptive right, right of first
refusal or similar right in respect of the Shares, including any associated
notice related thereto, whether arising under Law, Contract or otherwise.



ARTICLE III 

PURCHASE PRICE

Section 3.1 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for the Shares shall
be equal to, without duplication: (a) $765,000,000, (b) plus the Net Working
Capital Overage (if any), (c) minus the Net Working Capital



Underage (if any), (d) minus Indebtedness as of the Benchmark Time, (e) minus
Transaction Expenses (if any), (f) plus Cash as of the Benchmark Time, (g)
plus the sum of the Option Exercise Price and the Option Tax Deduction Value
(the amount calculated pursuant to this sentence, the "Purchase Price").

Section 3.2 Closing Purchase Price.

(a) On the Pre-Closing Delivery Date, the Sellers shall prepare and the Seller
Representative shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement (the "Closing
Purchase Price Statement"), setting forth (i) the Estimated Net Working
Capital, (ii) the Estimated Indebtedness, (iii) the Estimated Cash and (iv)
the Estimated Transaction Expenses, together with reasonable supporting detail
and documentation. On the Currency Measurement Date the Sellers shall deliver
to the Purchaser the Sellers' good faith calculation of the Purchase Price as

through (g) of the definition of Purchase Price converted to dollars at the
NOK/USD Exchange Rate (with respect to clause (e), if not already specified in
USD)) and reconverting any exchanges estimated in Schedule A as of the
Currency Measurement Date as contemplated thereby (such calculation, the
"Closing Purchase Price"). The Closing Purchase Price Statement shall be
accompanied by a certificate of the Company's Chief Financial Officer stating
that the Closing Purchase Price Statement has been prepared in accordance with
this Agreement, including the Accounting Principles.

(b) The Purchaser and its Representatives shall have a reasonable opportunity
to review and to discuss with the Seller Representative and its
Representatives the Closing Purchase Price Statement and the Seller
Representative and its Representatives shall reasonably assist the Purchaser
and its Representatives in their review of the Closing Purchase Price
Statement.

(c) The Seller Representative shall consider in good faith any comments or
objections to any amounts set forth on the Closing Purchase Price Statement
notified to it by the Purchaser prior to the Closing and if, prior to the
Closing, the Seller Representative and the Purchaser agree to make any
modification to the Closing Purchase Price Statement, then the Closing
Purchase Price Statement as so modified shall be deemed to be the Closing
Purchase Price Statement for purposes of calculating the Closing Purchase
Price. If the Purchaser and the Seller Representative fail to agree upon the
amounts set forth in the Closing Purchase Price Statement at least two (2)
days prior to the Closing Date, then, subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(if permissible) of the conditions set forth in Article VIII at the Closing,
the Closing Date shall proceed on November 10, 2015 at the agreed upon time
(or at such time and on such date as otherwise contemplated by Section 4.1
hereof) and the Closing Purchase Price set forth in the Closing Purchase Price
Statement delivered by the Seller Representative shall be paid at the Closing.

Section 3.3 Post-Closing Adjustment.

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing and in no event later
than sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare
and deliver a statement (the "Post-Closing Statement"), setting forth the
Purchaser's good faith calculation of (i) Net Working Capital as of the
Benchmark Time (the "Preliminary Net Working Capital"), (ii) Indebtedness as
of the Benchmark Time (the "Preliminary Indebtedness"), (iii) Transaction
Expenses (the "Preliminary Transaction Expenses"), (iv) Cash as of the
Benchmark Time (the "Preliminary Cash"), and (v) the resulting calculation of
the Purchase Price (such calculation the "Preliminary Purchase Price Amount"),
together with reasonable supporting detail and documentation. The Post-Closing
Statement shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Chief Financial Officer
or other senior officer of the Purchaser stating that the Post-Closing
Statement has been prepared in accordance with this Agreement, including the
Accounting Principles.

(b) Upon receipt of the Post-Closing Statement, the Seller Representative
shall have forty-five (45) days (the "Review Period") to review such Post-
Closing Statement and related computations of the Preliminary



Net Working Capital, the Preliminary Indebtedness, the Preliminary Transaction
Expenses, the Preliminary Cash and the resulting Preliminary Purchase Price
Amount. In connection with the review of the Post-Closing Statement, the
Purchaser shall give, and shall cause the Target Companies and its and the
Target Companies' Affiliates to cooperate with and give, to the Seller
Representative and its Representatives, reasonable access to the relevant
books and records of the Target Companies and the personnel of, and work
papers used in the preparation of the Post-Closing Statement and prepared by
or for, the Purchaser or the Target Companies as the Seller Representative or
its Representatives may reasonably request. If the Seller Representative has
accepted such Post-Closing Statement in writing or has not given written
notice to the Purchaser setting forth any objection of the Seller
Representative (which objection may only be on the basis that the Post-Closing
Statement or any element thereof contains computational errors or was not
prepared in accordance with this Agreement, including the Accounting
Principles ("Permitted Objections")) to such Post-Closing Statement (a
"Statement of Objections") prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then
such Post-Closing Statement shall be final and binding upon the parties, and
shall be deemed the Final Closing Statement for purposes of Section 3.3(c).
Any Statement of Objections given by the Seller Representative shall specify
in reasonable detail each item that the Seller Representative disputes, the
amount in dispute and the reasons supporting the Seller Representative's
position. The Seller Representative shall be deemed to have agreed with all
items and amounts contained in the Post-Closing Statement not challenged in
the Statement of Objections. In the event that the Seller Representative
delivers a Statement of Objections during the Review Period, the Purchaser and
the Seller Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
objection within thirty (30) days following the receipt by the Purchaser of
the Statement of Objections (the "Consultation Period"). If the Seller
Representative and the Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement as to any
such Permitted Objections within such thirty (30) day period, then either
party may submit such matter to Ernst and Young LLP, or, if such accounting firm
is unable or unwilling to serve in such role, another "Big Four" independent
accounting firm or other accounting firm of national standing that is not the
independent auditor of either the Purchaser or any Seller that is reasonably
acceptable to the Purchaser and the Seller Representative (in either case,
such accountant, the "Settlement Accountant") (provided, that, if the
Purchaser and the Seller Representative cannot agree on an accountant within
forty (40) days of receipt by a party of a Statement of Objections, then the
American Arbitration Association shall appoint the Settlement Accountant), for
resolution of the remaining disputed matters. The Settlement Accountant shall
act as an expert and shall only consider those items that are identified on
the Statement of Objections as in dispute unless modified during the
Consultation Period. Within five (5) days of the appointment of the Settlement
Accountant, the Settlement Accountant shall set a schedule for written
submissions, which submissions shall be transmitted simultaneously to the
Settlement Accountant and all parties. Unless otherwise directed by the
Settlement Accountant, the Purchaser shall first make a written submission
addressing the challenged items on the Statement of Objections, the Seller
Representative shall be given an opportunity to respond to the Purchaser's
submission and, if the Seller Representative does so, the Purchaser shall be
given an opportunity to respond to the Seller Representative's response and to
the extent such response by the Purchaser contains new information, material
or arguments, the Seller Representative shall be given an opportunity to
respond solely to such new arguments. The Settlement Accountant will have the
right to request any information or ask any questions. The Settlement
Accountant's determination shall take into account the definitions of Net
Working Capital, Cash, Transaction Expenses and Indebtedness contained herein.
The Seller Representative and the Purchaser shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Settlement Accountant to resolve
all disagreements as soon as practicable and in any event within twenty (20)
days after the submission of any dispute to the Settlement Accountant. The
Settlement Accountant's determination shall be made solely in accordance with
the terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement including the Accounting
Principles and based solely on the submissions and supporting materials
provided by the Purchaser and the Seller Representative in accordance with the
terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an
independent review). The Settlement Accountant may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The
resolution of the dispute by the Settlement Accountant shall be final, binding
and non-appealable on the parties hereto. The costs and expenses of the
Settlement Accountant shall be borne by the Purchaser in the proportion



that the aggregate NOK amount of the items that are successfully disputed by
the Seller Representative (as finally determined by the Settlement Accountant)
bears to the aggregate NOK amount of the items submitted to the Settlement
Accountant and by the Seller Representative in the proportion that the
aggregate NOK amount of the disputed items that are unsuccessfully disputed by
the Seller Representative (as finally determined by the Settlement Accountant)
bears to the aggregate NOK amount of the items submitted to the Settlement
Accountant.

(c) The Post-Closing Statement (i) that has become final and binding pursuant
to the third sentence of Section 3.3(b) or the sixth sentence of Section
3.3(b) or (ii) as determined by the Settlement Accountant is referred to
herein as the "Final Closing Statement" and (A) the Net Working Capital set
forth on such Final Closing Statement shall be deemed the final Net Working
Capital, (B) the Indebtedness set forth on such Final Closing Statement shall
be deemed the final Indebtedness, (C) the Cash set forth on such Final Closing
Statement shall be deemed the final Cash, (D) the Transaction Expenses set
forth on such Final Closing Statement shall be deemed the final Transaction
Expenses and (E) the Purchase Price (with the NOK-denominated amounts
specified in clauses (b) through (g) of the definition of Purchase Price
converted to dollars at the NOK/USD Exchange Rate (with respect to clause (e),
if not already specified in USD)) set forth on such Final Closing Statement
shall be deemed the final Purchase Price (the "Final Purchase Price").

(d) In the event that the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Closing
Purchase Price (such excess, the "Final Overage"), the Purchaser shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, within five (5) Business Days of the
determination of the Final Overage and the Final Closing Statement, with the
Sellers, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the proportions
set forth in the Seller Allocation Schedule, an amount equal to such Final
Overage.

(e) In the event that the Closing Purchase Price is greater than the Final
Purchase Price (such excess, the "Final Underage"), the Sellers shall
severally, but not jointly deposit, or cause to be deposited, within five (5)
Business Days of the determination of the Final Underage and the Final Closing
Statement, with the Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
based on the proportions set forth in the Seller Allocation Schedule (without
regard to the deductions contemplated by the footnote included therein), an
amount equal to such Final Underage.

(f) The parties hereto agree that any adjustment as determined pursuant to
this Section 3.3 shall be treated as an adjustment to the consideration for
Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by Law.

Section 3.4 Interest. If any amount due for payment in accordance with this
Agreement is not paid on the due date for payment, the Person in default shall
pay the Default Interest on such amount from (but excluding) the due date to
(and including) the date of actual payment, calculated on a daily basis.

Section 3.5 Withholding. Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the
contrary, the Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amount otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts
as are required to be deducted and withheld under applicable Law. Any amounts
so deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. If the Purchaser determines that any withholding
described in this Section 3.5 may be required in respect of any payment to be
made to any Seller under this Agreement, the Purchaser shall notify the
Company and the applicable Seller of any such requirement as soon as
reasonably practical after such determination is made by the Purchaser and
shall cooperate in good faith with the Company and such Seller to reduce or
eliminate any such withholding. As of the date hereof, the Purchaser is not
aware of any requirement to withhold from payments of the Purchase Price under
currently applicable Tax Law.





ARTICLE IV 

CLOSING

Section 4.1 Closing.

(a) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver (if permissible) of the conditions

offices of Wikborg, Rein and Co. Advokatfirma DA, Kronprinsesse Marthas pl. 1,
Oslo, Norway at 9:00 a.m. Central European Time on November 10, 2015 or at
such other date and time as the Purchaser and the Seller Representative may
mutually agree in writing (such date and time, the "Closing Date"), provided,
that if the Closing does not occur at the date and time otherwise called for
by this Section 4.1 (the "Scheduled Date") by virtue of the failure of the
conditions set forth in Article VIII to be satisfied or waived, then the
Closing shall (subject to the satisfaction or waiver (if permissible) at the
Closing of such conditions) take place at 9:00 a.m. Central European Time on
the third Business Day following the first day after the Scheduled Date on
which such conditions are satisfied or waived (if permissible).

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that as of any date on or
prior to November 16, 2015 on which the Closing is scheduled to occur, all of
the conditions set forth in Article VIII are satisfied or waived (if
permissible) other than the condition set forth in Section 8.2(f) (which shall
not be waiveable for purposes of this Section 4.1(b)), the Seller
Representative shall thereupon have the right in its sole discretion (but not
the obligation) to elect, by written notice given to the Purchaser on or prior
to November 16, 2015, to proceed with a sale of the shares of Salar MidCo AS
by the Company to the Purchaser (a "MidCo Sale") in lieu of a sale of the
Shares by the Sellers for the same Purchase Price (subject to adjustment to
reflect any required changes to address the mechanics for the Option
Agreements (including any related amendment to the Option Exercise
Agreements)) and same terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (other
than (x) such changes as necessary in the definitions of Company (as
applicable), Target Company and Shares, Section 2.1, Section 4.2(a), Section
4.3(b), Section 5.4(b) and Section 7.2 to reflect the removal of the Company
as a Target Company and to effect the MidCo Sale, (y) the deletion of Section
4.2(b) and Section 7.11 and appropriate changes to account for the treatment
of the Option Agreements in connection with a MidCo Sale and (z) such other
changes to this Agreement and the Schedules hereto (and the annexes thereto)
as are reasonably necessary to reflect the change in entity being purchased
and the foregoing changes). In the event the Seller Representative timely
makes such an election to effect a MidCo Sale, the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative shall promptly (and in any event within seven (7) calendar
days) in good faith make the necessary amendments to this Agreement (including
providing for the Company to become an additional Seller) to provide for a
MidCo Sale as contemplated above, it being understood and agreed that, in any
such event, the provisions set forth in Section 7.4 of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, in no event shall the Purchaser be obligated to consummate a
MidCo Sale if the closing with respect thereto shall not have occurred on or
prior to November 23, 2015.

(c) In the event that pursuant to Section 4.1(b) the Seller Representative
shall have the right to elect to effect a MidCo Sale and either (i) the Seller
Representative does not make a timely election or (ii) the Seller
Representative makes a timely election and the closing on the MidCo Sale does
not occur on or prior to November 23, 2015, then the Purchaser shall thereupon
have the right (but not the obligation) to elect, by written notice given to
the Seller Representative not later than January 31, 2016, to consummate the
purchase of the Shares of Seller S.a.r.l. contemplated to be sold hereunder
without simultaneously consummating the purchase of the Shares of Seller AS
contemplated to be sold hereunder (an "Alternate Purchase and Sale"). In the
event the Purchaser elects to effect an



Alternate Purchase and Sale, (A) the Purchaser and the Seller Representative
shall promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) in good faith
amend this Agreement to provide for the Alternate Purchase and Sale and the
deferred purchase and sale of the Shares of Seller AS contemplated to be sold
hereunder (the "Deferred Purchase and Sale"), in each case on terms that
preserve the economic benefits and burdens of the parties hereunder to the
extent possible, and the Purchaser and Seller S.a.r.l shall forthwith
consummate the Alternate Purchase and Sale on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement as so amended, it being understood and
agreed that, in any such event, (1) the provisions set forth in Section 7.4 of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until such time as the
Deferred Purchase and Sale shall be consummated, (2) from and after the
consummation of the Alternate Purchase and Sale, this Agreement (as so
amended) shall not be terminable by any Seller or the Seller Representative
pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof (other than clause (f) of such Section 9.1) and
(3) any obligation on the part of the Purchaser to consummate the Deferred
Purchase and Sale shall terminate upon notice given at any time after January
31, 2016, by the Purchaser to the Seller Representative, in its sole
discretion, if the condition set forth in Section 8.2(f) shall not have been
satisfied by such date, (B) Seller S.a.r.l, shall assist and cooperate with,
and take all actions reasonably requested by, the Purchaser to seek to cause
the Deferred Purchase and Sale to be consummated as promptly as practicable,
including using their reasonable best efforts to take actions (or cause action
to be taken) or enforce rights (or cause rights to be enforced) under the
Investment Agreement and/or the ManagementCo Investment Agreement or other
applicable Contracts or Law (including through commencing and prosecuting
litigation) and (C) the closing of the Deferred Purchase and Sale shall occur
promptly following the time the condition set forth in Section 8.2(f) is
satisfied, subject to the satisfaction or waiver (if permissible) at the
Closing of the other conditions agreed between the parties pursuant to the
amendment contemplated by this Section 4.1(c).

(a) During the period commencing on the date hereof and terminating upon the
earlier to occur of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, the
Seller Representative will give the Purchaser prompt written notice of any
material development that would make the satisfaction of any of the conditions
set forth in Section 8.1 or 8.2 on the Closing Date reasonably unlikely or
impossible. No such notification shall be given any effect for purposes of
determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by the
Sellers pursuant to this Agreement or determining whether the conditions set

however, that the foregoing will not: (a) interfere with the day-to-day
operations of the Target Companies; and (b) require the Sellers or the Target
Companies to provide access or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would contravene any Law or contract, or would relate to
commercially sensitive information as reasonably determined by the Sellers in
good faith, or would result in the waiver of any legal privilege or work-
product protection. Until the Closing, any information disclosed will be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 7.8 Seller Representative.

(a) In order to efficiently administer certain matters contemplated hereby
following the date hereof, including the defense or settlement of any claims,

Seller Representative hereby accepts such appointment.

(b) In the event the Seller Representative becomes unable to perform its

and the documents delivered pursuant hereto.

(c) All decisions and actions by the Seller Representative shall be binding
upon all Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent,

(d) The Seller Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as the Seller Representative so long as such action did not

The Seller Representative shall be entitled to be indemnified and held
harmless by Sellers against any loss, liability or expense incurred without
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Seller
Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of his duties hereunder. The Sellers shall reimburse to the
Seller Representative the expenses of the Seller Representative pro rata in
accordance with the allocation set forth on the Seller Allocation Schedule.

(e) The Purchaser shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions
and decisions given or made by the Seller Representative and no party shall

assigns of each Seller, and any references in this Agreement to a Seller means
and include the successors to such Seller's rights hereunder.

consideration to any third party from whom consent or approval is requested

The Purchaser agrees to adopt a resolution to exempt the Resigned Directors
from any liability toward the Target Companies in their capacity as directors
of the Target Company, absent fraud or gross negligence on the part of the
Resigned Directors. The Purchaser and its Affiliates will not, in the absence
of fraud or gross negligence, raise any claim against any directors of any

discretion) (the "Distribution") and (ii) effectuate the transactions
contemplated by the Option Agreements and the Option Exercise Agreements, such

directors of Seller AS, and none of the Purchaser, the Target Companies or any
of their respective Affiliates shall have any liability or responsibility
therefor to any such holder or otherwise.

(c) On the date of, and promptly following, the execution of this Agreement,
Seller AS shall call and, as soon as permitted by applicable Law, convene a

legal opinions) the defeasance pursuant to Section 19.2 of the Bond Loan

otherwise prohibiting the Proposed Transaction;

Outside Date;

(e) by the Seller Representative if the Purchaser shall have breached any of
its representations and warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this

following notice of such

and (b) Article XI and the agreements of the Sellers and the Purchaser

that the Fundamental Representations and the Purchaser Fundamental
Representations shall survive until the fourth (4th) anniversary of the

ARTICLE XI 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 11.1 Announcements.

(a) The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement
shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by the Purchaser
and the Seller Representative. Following such initial press release and until
the Closing, the parties hereto will consult with each other before issuing
press releases or otherwise making any public statements or communicating with
the employees of the Target Companies with respect to this Agreement or the
Proposed Transaction and the parties hereto shall not issue any such press
release or public statement



without the prior approval of the other party (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, the foregoing shall not
prevent the Purchaser from extending offers of employment or engagement to
Company Personnel, or otherwise communicating with Company Personnel regarding
employment or services following the Closing.

(b) The restriction in Section 11.1(a) shall not apply (i) to communications
by a Seller to its direct or indirect investors, (ii) to internal
announcements made by any party to their respective employees and other
stockholders that are not inconsistent in any material respects with the prior
public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) to
the extent the public announcement is required (A) by Law or any Governmental
Authority or (it being understood and agreed that the Purchaser shall be
permitted to file a copy of this Agreement and a description thereof on Form
8-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in connection with
the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Proposed
Transaction) or (B) by a party to enforce the terms of this Agreement;

making the announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party in advance as to its form, content and timing.

Section 11.2 Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder may not be assigned unless (a) such assignment is consented to in
writing by both the Purchaser and the Sellers, or (b) the Purchaser assigns
its rights, in whole or in part, to a direct or indirect wholly owned
Affiliate of the Purchaser, but in the case of clause (b), no such assignment
will relieve the Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement. This
Agreement and all the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

Section 11.3 Specific Performance. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the
other parties may be irreparably damaged if this Agreement is not performed in
accordance with its terms and that any breach of this Agreement and the non-
consummation of the Proposed Transaction may not be adequately compensated in
all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other
right or remedy to which a party may be entitled, at Law or equity, that party
shall be entitled to specific performance and the issuance of immediate
injunctive and other equitable relief without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, and the parties further agree to
waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection
with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief.

Section 11.4 Costs and Expenses; Taxes.

(a) Subject to this Section 11.4 and except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand,
shall each be responsible for their own costs, charges and other expenses
incurred in connection with the Proposed Transaction.

(b) The Purchaser shall be responsible for the preparation and filing (and all
costs related thereto) of Tax Returns (including any documentation) with
respect to all transfer, documentation, sales, use, stamp, registration, and

or which may be payable in connection with this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby. The Purchaser shall be responsible for any and all such
Taxes.

(c) Any refunds of Taxes plus any interest received with respect thereto from
the applicable Tax Authorities for any period shall be for the benefit of the
Purchaser. In the event that a Tax Authority determines a deficiency in any
Tax, the Purchaser shall have authority to determine whether to dispute such
deficiency determination and to control the prosecution or settlement of such
dispute.

Section 11.6 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement set forth the entire agreement among the parties in respect of the
sale and purchase of the Shares and supersedes any prior agreement (whether
oral or written) relating to the Proposed Transaction. Except in the case of
fraud, no party shall have any claim or remedy in respect of any statement,
representation, warranty or undertaking, made by or on behalf of the other
party in relation to the Proposed Transaction which is not expressly set forth
in this Agreement.

Section 11.7 Waivers. No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right
or remedy provided by Law or under this Agreement shall impair such right or
remedy or operate or be construed as a waiver or variation of it or preclude
its exercise at any subsequent time and no single or partial exercise of any
such right or remedy shall preclude any further exercise of it or the exercise
of any other remedy.

Section 11.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
separate counterparts (including by means of facsimile or electronic mail in
"portable document format" form, or by any other electronic means intended to
preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document), each of
which is an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same instrument.

Section 11.9 Amendments. No amendment to this Agreement shall be valid unless
it is in writing and duly executed by the Purchaser and the Seller
Representative.

Section 11.10 Severability. Each of the provisions of this Agreement is
severable. If any such provision is held to be or becomes invalid or
unenforceable in any respect under the Law of any jurisdiction, it shall have
no effect in that respect and the parties shall use all reasonable efforts to
replace it in that respect with a valid and enforceable substitute provision
the effect of which is as close to its intended effect as possible.

Section 11.11 Third Party Beneficiaries. A person who is not a party to this
Agreement shall have no right to enforce any of its terms and this Agreement
is not intended to give any Person other than the parties hereto and their
permitted assigns any rights hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Seller Representative is an intended third party beneficiary with respect to
the provisions of Section 7.8.

Section 11.12 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR
DISPUTE ARISING UNDER OR RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES, THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION AND/OR THE
INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER OR RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE FOREGOING, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOMESTIC LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT
GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OR CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE
APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

Section 11.13 Dispute Resolution. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS SITTING IN NEW CASTLE
COUNTY, DELAWARE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY AND AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS
IN RESPECT OF THE SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED
IN ANY SUCH COURT. EACH PARTY AGREES TO COMMENCE ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
OTHER PROCEEDING IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS SITTING IN NEW CASTLE COUNTY,
DELAWARE,



AND HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS WITH REGARD TO ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY, TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS. EACH
PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT ANY DEFENSE OF IMPROPER
VENUE OR INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING SO
BROUGHT, ANY CLAIM THAT IT IS NOT PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF
THE ABOVE NAMED COURTS, ANY CLAIM THAT IT OR ITS PROPERTY IS EXEMPT OR IMMUNE
FROM JURISDICTION OF ANY SUCH COURT OR FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS COMMENCED IN
SUCH COURTS (WHETHER THROUGH SERVICE OF NOTICE, ATTACHMENT PRIOR TO JUDGMENT,
ATTACHMENT IN AID OF EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT, EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT OR
OTHERWISE), AND WAIVES ANY BOND, SURETY, OR OTHER SECURITY THAT MIGHT BE
REQUIRED OF ANY OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT THERETO. ANY PARTY MAY MAKE SERVICE
ON ANY OTHER PARTY BY SENDING OR DELIVERING A COPY OF THE PROCESS TO THE PARTY
TO BE SERVED AT THE ADDRESS AND IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR THE GIVING OF
NOTICES IN SECTION 11.5. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 11.13, HOWEVER, SHALL AFFECT
THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE LEGAL PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY
LAW OR AT EQUITY. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING SO BROUGHT SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED BY SUIT ON THE
JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW OR AT EQUITY.

EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO
ANY ACTION OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF ANY DISPUTE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SUCH
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. EACH OF THE PARTIES (i) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVERS AND (ii) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED HEREIN.

This Section 11.13 shall not apply to any dispute under Article III that is
required to be decided by the Settlement Accountant.

Section 11.14 Privilege; Counsel. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP
("Skadden") and Wikborg, Rein and Co. Advokatfirma DA ("Wikborg Rein") have been
engaged by the Sellers to represent them in connection with the Proposed
Transaction. The Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates)
hereby (a) agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between the Purchaser and/or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and a
Seller, on the other hand, any of Skadden or Wikborg Rein may represent such
Seller in such dispute even though the interests of such Seller may be
directly adverse to the Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates and even though any of Skadden or Wikborg Rein may have represented
the Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be
handling ongoing matters for the Purchaser or the Company and (b) waives any
conflict in connection therewith. The Purchaser (on its behalf and on behalf
of its Affiliates) further agrees that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, as to all communications among any of Skadden or
Wikborg Rein, the Target Companies and/or the Sellers (including any of their
respective directors, officers or employees) that relate in any way to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Proposed
Transaction and are subject to the attorney-client privilege, none of the
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall introduce
such communication as evidence in any proceeding in support of a claim against
a Seller relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the Purchaser, the
Company or any of their respective Affiliates and a third party other than a



party to this Agreement after the Closing, the Company may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications
by any of Skadden or Wikborg Rein to such third party; provided, however, that
the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
the Seller Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).
