   3.4 | _Capitalization; Title to Contributed Interest_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | WGP will on the Closing Date own, beneficially and of
record, all of the Contributed Interest free and clear of all Liens and will
convey good and marketable title to the Contributed Interest to WOL and WOFP
as contemplated by this Agreement and the CCA. The Contributed Interest is
not subject to any agreements or understandings with respect to the voting or
transfer of any of the Contributed Interest (except the contribution of the
Contributed Interest contemplated by this Agreement and restrictions under
applicable federal and state securities laws). The Contributed Equity Interest
has been duly authorized and is validly issued, fully paid (to the extent
required under the organizational documents of WECU PARENTCO) and
nonassessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by Applicable
Law of the Netherlands with respect to cooperatives). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | WECU PARENTCO will on the Closing Date own, of record and
beneficially, the outstanding equity interests of WECU free and clear of any

securities laws). All the outstanding equity interests of WECU have been duly
authorized and are validly issued, fully paid (to the extent required by the
organizational documents of WECU) and nonassessable (except as provided under
Applicable Law governing the Contributed Entities). WECU will on the Closing
Date be the only legal entity or other Person in which WECU PARENTCO owns,
directly or indirectly, an equity interest. WECU PARENTCO is a holding company
and has no assets, other than its equity interest in WECU, and has no
liabilities (except as set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 5.5_ ) or operations

refusal or any similar rights issued or granted by, or binding upon, any of
the Contributing Parties or the Contributed Entities to purchase or otherwise
acquire or to sell or otherwise dispose of the Contributed Interest or the
equity interests of WECU or WECU PARENTCO, except as contemplated by the
organizational documents of the Contributed Entities, this Agreement or the

and statements of income for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2012
and 2013 for WECU, after reflecting the adjustments set forth on _Disclosure
Schedule 3.5(a)_ (collectively referred to as the "Financial Statements"). The
Financial Statements present fairly in all material respects the financial
position of WECU as of the dates thereof and the results of operations of WECU
for the periods presented. Except as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule 3.5(a)_
, there are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a Contributed Entity Material Adverse Effect. The
Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied throughout the periods presented, except that the Financial Statements
reflect the transactions set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 3.5(a)_ and do not
include any notes. Except as required by GAAP, there were no changes in the
method of application of WECUs accounting policies or changes in the method
of applying WECUs use of estimates in the preparation of the Financial
Statements as compared with past practice. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | There are no liabilities or obligations of the Contributed
Entities of any nature (whether known or unknown and whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise) and there are no facts or circumstances
that would reasonably be expected to result in any such liabilities or
obligations, whether arising in the context of federal, state or local
judicial, regulatory, administrative or permitting agency proceedings, other
than (i) liabilities or obligations accrued in the Financial Statements, (ii)
current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since November
30, 2013, (iii) liabilities or obligations set forth on _Disclosure Schedule
3.5(b)_ , and (iv) liabilities or obligations (whether known or unknown and
whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Contributed
Entity Material Adverse Effect.  
---|---|--- 
 



22 ---|--- 

The system of internal controls over financial reporting to which the
Contributed Entities are subject is sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance (a) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP consistently
applied throughout the periods presented, (b) that transactions are executed
only in accordance with the authorization of management, and (c) regarding the
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the assets of such Contributed Entities.



   3.7 | _Real Property; Rights-of-Way_.

property and buildings held under lease by any of the Contributed Entities
(the "Leased Real Property") and (iii) good title to all tangible personal
property that comprises the Contributed Entities Assets, all of which Owned
Real Property, Leased Real Property and personal property are sufficient for
the operation of such Contributed Entities business as presently conducted,
free and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens, except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Contributed Entity Material Adverse Effect;
_provided_ , that, with respect to any real property and buildings held under
lease by any Contributed Entity, such real property and buildings are held
under valid and subsisting and enforceable leases with such exceptions as do
not materially interfere with the use of the properties of the Contributed
Entities taken as a whole as they have been used consistent with past
practice of the Contributed Entities. With respect to the Leased Real
Property, except to the extent described to the contrary on _Disclosure
Schedule 3.7(a)_ , all leases and subleases are in full force and effect and
the Contributed Entities have not received any written notice of a breach or
default thereunder, whether actual or alleged and, to the Knowledge of the
Contributing Parties, no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute a breach or default under any such lease or
sublease, except for any such breaches or defaults that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Contributed
Entity Material Adverse Effect. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

Each of the Contributed Entities has such consents, easements, rights-of-way,
permits and licenses from each Person, including Governmental Authorities
(collectively, the "Rights-of-Way" and together with the Owned Real Property
and Leased Real Property, the "Real Property") as are sufficient to conduct
the Contributed Entities business substantially in accordance with past
practice, except for such Rights-of-Way the absence of which have not had, and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Contributed Entity Material Adverse Effect. With respect to the Rights-of-
Way, except to the extent described to the contrary on _Disclosure Schedule
3.7(b)_ , (i) each of the Contributed Entities has fulfilled and performed all
its material obligations thereunder and no default or other event has
occurred that allows, or after notice or

23 or would result in any impairment of the rights of the holder of any of the
Rights-of-Way, except for such revocations, terminations and impairments that
have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Contributed Entity Material Adverse Effect; and (ii) none of
the Rights-of-Way contains any restriction that is materially burdensome to
the Contributed Entities, taken as a whole. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | Except as set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 3.7(c)_ , (i)
(A) there are no pending proceedings or actions to modify the zoning
classification of, or to condemn or take by power of eminent domain or
other similar proceeding, all or any of the Contributed Entities Assets and
(B) neither Contributing Party has any Knowledge of any such threatened
proceeding or action, which (in either case), if pursued, would reasonably be
expected to have a Contributed Entity Material Adverse Effect, (ii) to the
extent located in jurisdictions subject to zoning, the Real Property is
properly zoned for the existence, occupancy and use of all of the improvements
located thereon, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Contributed Entity Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) none of such
improvements are subject to any conditional use permits or "permitted non-
conforming use" or "permitted non-conforming structure" classifications or
similar permits or classifications, except as would not, either currently or
in the case of a rebuilding of or additional construction of improvements,
reasonably be expected to have a Contributed Entity Material Adverse Effect.

in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Contributed Entity Material
Adverse Effect.

Authorities that are necessary for the conduct of the Contributed Entities

directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants or other similar
representatives, including, but not limited to, any "employee benefit plan"
as defined in section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of

referred to as "Plans"). All Plans in which Associated Employees participate
are sponsored or maintained by a Contributing Party or its Affiliate.

     | (d) |

With respect to any Plan that the Contributing Parties (or any entity treated
as a single employer with a Contributing Party for purposes of Section 414 of
the Code or Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA (the "Contributing Parties Aggregated
Group")) has maintained within the last six years or has had any obligation to
contribute to within the past six years, (i) except for an event described in
Section 4043(c)(3) of ERISA and except for an event that would not impose any
liability on the Partnership Parties or the Contributed Entities, there has
been no "reportable event," as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA,
for which the thirty (30) day reporting requirement has not been waived, and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in such a
"reportable event" for which a waiver does not apply, (ii) none of the
Contributed Entities, the Contributing Parties or any member of the
Contributing Parties Aggregated Group has incurred any direct or indirect
liability under Title IV of ERISA other than liability for premiums to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation that have been timely paid and other than
any liabilities for which the Contributed Entities have no direct or indirect
responsibility or obligation, and (iii) there does not exist any accumulated
funding deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section
302 of ERISA, whether or not waived that, in either case, would give rise to a
Lien on any of the Contributed Entities Assets or that would

30 Material Adverse Effect. None of the Contributed Entities, the Contributing
Parties or any member of the Contributing Parties Aggregated Group
contributes to, or has an obligation to contribute to, and has not within six
years prior to the Closing Date contributed to, or had an obligation to
contribute to, a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA (x) that is, or is reasonably expected to be in "critical" or
"endangered" status as defined in Section 432 of the Code or Section 305 of
ERISA, or (y) in respect of which a Contributed Entity, a Contributing Party
or any member of the Contributing Parties Aggregated Group has or may
reasonably be expected to incur any withdrawal liability (as defined in
Section 4201 of ERISA). 
---|--- 
 



     | (e) | The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under
all of the Plans of Williams or its Affiliates subject to Title IV of ERISA

end of such Title IV Plans most recently ended plan year on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions specified for funding purposes in such Title IV Plans
actuarial valuation report for such plan year, did not exceed by more than
$300 million the aggregate current value of the assets of all such Title IV
Plans allocable to such benefit liabilities. No Title IV Plan is, or is
reasonably expected to be within one year immediately following the Closing,
in "at-risk" status (as defined in Section 303(i)(4) of ERISA or Section
430(i)(4) of the Code). The term "benefit liabilities" has the meaning
specified in section 4001 of ERISA and the terms "current value" and "present
value" have the meaning specified in section 3 of ERISA.

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any subsequent employment-related
event) result in any payment becoming due, result in the acceleration of the
time of payment or vesting of any benefits under the Plans, result in the
incurrence or acceleration of any other obligation related to the Plans or to
any employee or former employee of any Contributing Party or any of its
Affiliates. 
---|---|--- 



     | (g) | All costs and liabilities associated with Associated

There is no labor strike, or other material dispute, slowdown or stoppage
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Contributing Parties, threatened against
any Contributing Party or any Contributed Entity with respect to any employee
that will be providing services to such Contributed Entities.

 



   3.17 | _Transactions with Affiliates_. 
---|--- 

Except as otherwise contemplated in this Agreement or as set forth on

Affiliates, on the other hand, other than those entered into (i) in the
ordinary course of business relating to the provision of offgas, natural gas
liquids, paraffins and/or olefins extraction, processing, transportation,
marketing or storage service, the interconnection of the respective pipeline
systems of WECU and its Affiliates, the provision of construction, operating
and management services to the Contributed Entities, or the purchase or sale

Except as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule 3.18_ , the Contributed

insured under, insurance policies underwritten by reputable insurers that
include coverages and related limits and deductibles that are customary for
companies of similar size and complexity as the Contributing Parties in the
offgas, natural gas liquids, paraffins and/or olefins extraction,
transportation, processing, marketing and storage industry, and consistent
with past practice. All such insurance policies are in full force and effect,

Each Contributed Entity owns or has the right to use all
Intellectual Property necessary for or used in the conduct of its business as
currently conducted by it, and its products and services do not infringe upon,
misappropriate or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property of any third
party. All Intellectual Property owned by any Contributed Entity, if any, is
free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens). Neither the
execution or delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will, with or without notice or lapse of
time, result in, or give any other Person the right or option to cause or
declare, a breach or termination of, or cancellation or reduction in, rights
of any Contributed Entity under any contract providing for the license of
any Intellectual Property to such Contributed Entity, except for any such
terminations, cancellations or reductions that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Contributed Entity Material Adverse Effect. There
is no Intellectual Property-related action, suit, proceeding, hearing,
investigation, notice or complaint pending or threatened by any third party
before any court or tribunal (including, without limitation, the United States
Patent and Trademark Office or equivalent authority anywhere in the world)
relating to any Contributed Entity or its operations, nor has any claim or
demand been made by any third party that alleges any infringement,
misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property of any
third party, or unfair competition or trade practices by any of the
Contributed Entities. Except as would not result in a Contributed Entity
Material Adverse Effect, the Contributed Entities have taken reasonable
measures to protect the confidentiality of all material trade secrets.

nor immediately after the Closing will be, subject to regulation under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.



   3.21 | _Brokerage Arrangements_. 
---|--- 

The Contributing Parties have not entered (directly or indirectly) into
any agreement with any Person that would obligate any Contributing Party to
pay any commission, brokerage or "finders fee" or other similar fee in
connection with this Agreement, the CCA Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.



   3.22 | _Books and Records_. 
---|--- 

Accurate copies of the respective books of account, minute books, stock or
other equity record books of each Contributed Entity have been made available
for inspection to the Partnership Parties.



   3.23 | _Investment Intent_. 
---|--- 

The Contributing Parties have substantial experience in analyzing and
investing in entities like the Partnership and are capable of evaluating the
merits and risks of their investment in the Partnership. The Contributing
Parties are being issued the Class D Units in the Private Equity Placement and
the Additional General Partner Units solely for the purpose of investment and

ARTICLE 7

 

TAX MATTERS



   7.1 | _Liability for Taxes_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Contributing Parties shall be liable for, and shall
indemnify and hold the Partnership Parties and their respective subsidiaries
harmless from any Taxes, together with any costs, expenses, losses or
damages, including reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys and
accountants fees and expenses, arising out of or incident to the
determination, assessment or collection of such Taxes ("Tax Losses"), (i)
imposed on or incurred by the Contributed Entities by reason of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local or foreign law or
regulation which is attributable to having been a member of any consolidated,
combined or unitary group on or prior to and including the Closing Date, (ii)
any Tax Losses (other than Tax Losses described in clause (i) above) imposed
on or incurred by or with respect to the Contributed Entities or the
Contributed Entities Assets with respect to the period prior to and
including the Closing Date, or (iii) attributable to a breach by any
Contributing Party of any representation (other than those contained in
_Section 3.10_, to which ARTICLE 9 shall be applicable), warranty or
covenant with respect to Taxes in this Agreement; provided, however, the
Contributing Parties liability for Tax Losses hereunder shall be reduced by
the amount of any Taxes included in such Tax Losses to the extent taken
into account in determining Final Net Working Capital. 
---|---|--- 
 



47 indemnify and hold the Contributing Parties and their Affiliates (other than
the Partnership Parties and their subsidiaries) harmless from, any Tax
Losses (i) imposed on or incurred by or with respect to the Contributed
Entities or the Contributed Entities Assets with respect to the period after
the Closing Date, or (ii) attributable to a breach by the Partnership Parties
of any covenant with respect to Taxes in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | Whenever it is necessary for purposes of this ARTICLE 7 to
determine the amount of any Taxes imposed on or incurred by or with respect to
the Contributed Entities or the Contributed Entities Assets for a
taxable period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date which is
allocable to the period prior to and including the Closing Date, the
determination shall be made, in the case of property or _ad valorem_ taxes or
franchise taxes (which are measured by, or based solely upon capital, debt or
a combination of capital and debt), on a _per diem_ basis and, in the case of
other Taxes, by assuming that such pre-Closing Date period constitutes a
separate taxable period applicable to the Contributed Entities and by taking
into account the actual taxable events occurring during such period (except
that exemptions, allowances and deductions for a taxable period beginning
before and ending after the Closing Date that are calculated on an annual or
periodic basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned
to the period prior to and including the Closing Date ratably on a _per diem_
basis). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any franchise
tax paid or payable with respect to the Contributed Entities or the
Contributed Entities Assets shall be allocated to the taxable period during
which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such
tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business for another
taxable period is obtained by the payment of such franchise tax. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | If any of the Partnership Parties or their Affiliates
receives a refund of any Taxes that any of the Contributing Parties are
responsible for hereunder, or if the Contributing Parties or their Affiliates
receive a refund of any Taxes that any of the Partnership Parties is
responsible for hereunder, the party receiving such refund shall, within
ninety (90) days after receipt of such refund, remit it to the party who has
responsibility for such Taxes hereunder; provided, however, the Partnership
Parties obligation to remit a refund to the Contributing Parties hereunder
shall be reduced by the amount of any Taxes included in such refund to the
extent taken into account in determining Final Net Working Capital. The
parties shall cooperate in order to take all necessary steps to claim any such
refund. 
---|---|--- 
 



48 ---|--- 



     | (a) | The Contributing Parties shall cause to be included in the
consolidated United States federal income Tax Returns (and the state, local or
foreign income Tax Returns of any jurisdiction that permits
consolidated, combined or unitary income Tax Returns, if any) of the Williams
Tax Group for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date, all the items
of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit ("Tax Items") with respect to the
Contributed Entities or the Contributed Entities Assets which are required
to be included therein, shall cause such Tax Returns to be timely filed with
the appropriate Taxing Authorities, and shall be responsible for the timely
payment (and entitled to any refund) of all Taxes due with respect to the
periods covered by such Tax Returns. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | With respect to any Tax Return covering a taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date that is required to be filed after the
Closing Date with respect to the Contributed Entities or the
Contributed Entities Assets that is not described in _Section 7.2(a)_
above, the Contributing Parties shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared,
cause to be included in such Tax Return all Tax Items required to be included

refund) of all Taxes due with respect to the period covered by such Tax
Return. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | With respect to any Tax Return covering a taxable period
beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date that
is required to be filed after the Closing Date with respect to the
Contributed Entities or the Contributed Entities Assets, the Contributing
Parties shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared, cause to be included in
such Tax Return all Tax Items required to be included therein, furnish a copy
of such Tax Return to the Partnership Parties, cause such Tax Return to be
filed timely with the appropriate Taxing Authority, and be responsible for the
timely payment of all Taxes due with respect to the period covered by such Tax
Return (but shall have a right to recover the amount of Tax Losses
attributable to the portion of the taxable period occurring after the Closing
Date pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_). 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | With regard to any Tax Return not yet filed for any taxable
period that begins before the Closing Date with respect to the Contributed
Entities or the Contributed Entities Assets, the Contributing Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Tax Return to be
prepared in accordance with past Tax accounting practices used with respect to
the Tax Returns in question (unless such past practices are no longer
permissible under the Applicable Law), and to the extent any items are not
covered by past practices, in accordance with reasonable tax accounting
practices selected by the filing party with respect to such Tax Return under
this Agreement with the consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
of the non-filing party. 
---|---|--- 
 



49 ---|--- 

The Contributing Parties shall file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees arising out of or in
connection with the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement (the
"Transfer Taxes") and shall be liable for and shall timely pay such Transfer
Taxes. If required by applicable Law, the Partnership Parties shall, and shall
cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation.



   7.4 | _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. 
---|--- 

All indemnification payments made under this Agreement, including any payment
made under this Article 7, shall be treated as increases or decreases to the
Aggregate Consideration for Tax purposes.



   7.5 | _Federal Income Tax Characterization of Transaction_. 
---|--- 

The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Contribution Transaction is
properly characterized for United States federal income tax purposes as a
contribution of the Contributed Interest to the Partnership (the indirect
parent of each of WOL and WOFP, each of which is an entity that
is disregarded from the Partnership for United States federal tax purposes)
in exchange for the Aggregate Consideration.



   7.6 | _Survival_. 
---|--- 

Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, rights and obligations of
the parties hereto with respect to any Tax matter covered by this Agreement
shall survive the Closing and shall not terminate until thirty (30) days after
the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations (including all
periods of extension and tolling) applicable to such Tax matter.



   7.7 | _Conflict_. 
---|--- 

In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this ARTICLE 7 and any
other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this ARTICLE 7 shall
control.

ARTICLE 8

51 ARTICLE 9

 

INDEMNIFICATION UPON CLOSING



   9.1 | _Indemnification of the Partnership Parties_. 
---|--- 

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Contributing
Parties, from and after the Closing Date, shall indemnify, defend and hold the
Partnership Parties, their subsidiaries and their respective securityholders,
directors, officers, and employees, and the officers, directors and employees
of the General Partner, but otherwise excluding the Contributing Parties and
its Affiliates (the "Partnership Indemnified Parties") harmless from and
against any and all Damages suffered or incurred by any
Partnership Indemnified Party as a result of or arising out of (i) any breach
or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of the Contributing Parties in
this Agreement or any Contributing Parties Closing Document, (ii) any breach
of any agreement or covenant on the part of the Contributing Parties made
under this Agreement or any Contributing Parties Closing Document or in
connection with the transaction contemplated hereby or thereby, or (iii) any
breach or violation of any Environmental Laws by the Contributed Entities
that occurs prior to Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that with regard to
subsection (iii), the Contributing Parties shall only be required to indemnify
the Partnership Indemnified Parties for Damages attributable to the
Contributed Interest. For purposes of this _Section 9.1_, whether the
Contributing Parties have breached any of their representations and warranties
herein shall be determined without giving effect to any qualification as to
"materiality" (including the word "material" or "Contributed Entity Material
Adverse Effect").



   9.2 | _Indemnification of the Contributing Parties_. 
---|--- 

Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Partnership
Parties shall indemnify, defend and hold the Contributing Parties, their
Affiliates (other than any of the Partnership Indemnified Parties) and their
respective securityholders, directors, officers, and employees
(the "Contributing Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and
all Damages suffered or incurred by the Contributing Indemnified Parties as a
result of or arising out of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation
or warranty of the Partnership Parties in this Agreement or any Partnership
Parties Closing Document, or (ii) any breach of any agreement or covenant on
the part of the Partnership Parties made under this Agreement or any
Partnership Parties Closing Document or in connection with the transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby. For purposes of this _Section 9.2_, whether
the Partnership Parties have breached any of their representations and
warranties herein shall be determined without giving effect to any
qualification as to "materiality" (including the word "material" or
"Partnership Material Adverse Effect").

 



   9.3 | Tax Indemnification. 
---|--- 

With the exception of a breach or inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Contributing Parties contained in _Section 3.10_, nothing
in this ARTICLE 9 shall apply to liability with respect to Taxes, the
liability with respect to which shall be as set forth in ARTICLE 7.

 



52 ---|--- 

All the provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing,
notwithstanding any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any
party hereto, provided that the representations and warranties set forth in
ARTICLE 3 and ARTICLE 4 and in any certificate delivered in connection
herewith with respect to any of those representations and warranties shall
terminate and expire on the first day of the 18th month following the month in
which Closing occurs, except (a) the representations and warranties of
the Contributing Parties set forth in _Section 3.10_ shall survive until 30
days after the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations (including
all periods of extension and tolling), (b) the representations and warranties
of the Contributing Parties set forth in _Section 3.11_ and _Section 3.15_
shall terminate and expire on the third anniversary of the Closing Date, (c)
the representations and warranties of the Contributing Parties set forth in 
_Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_ and _Section 3.4_ shall survive forever and
(d) the representations and warranties of the Partnership Parties set forth in
_Section 4.1_ and _Section 4.2_ shall survive forever. After a
representation and warranty has terminated and expired, no indemnification
shall or may be sought pursuant to this ARTICLE 9 on the basis of that
representation and warranty by any Person who would have been
entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE 9 to indemnification on the basis of that
representation and warranty prior to its termination and expiration, provided
that in the case of each representation and warranty that shall terminate and
expire as provided in this  _Section 9.4_, no claim presented in writing for
indemnification pursuant to this ARTICLE 9 on the basis of that representation
and warranty prior to its termination and expiration shall be affected in any
way by that termination and expiration. The indemnification obligations under
this ARTICLE 9 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall apply regardless of
whether any suit or action results solely or in part from the active, passive
or concurrent negligence or strict liability of the indemnified party. The
covenants and agreements entered into pursuant to this Agreement to be
performed after the Closing shall survive the Closing.



   9.5 | _Demands_. 
---|--- 

Each indemnified party hereunder agrees that promptly upon its discovery of
facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the provisions of this
Agreement, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion, claim,
action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third party (such claims
for indemnity involving third-party claims being collectively referred to
herein as the "Indemnity Claim"), with respect to any matter as to which it
claims to be entitled to indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement, it
will give prompt notice thereof in writing to the indemnifying party,
together with a statement of such information respecting any of the foregoing
as it shall have. Such notice shall include a formal demand for
indemnification under this Agreement.

 

If the indemnified party knowingly failed to notify the indemnifying party
thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in sufficient time
to permit the indemnifying party or its counsel to defend against an
Indemnity Claim and to make a timely response thereto, the indemnifying
partys indemnity obligation relating to such Indemnity Claim shall be limited
to the extent that such failure has actually prejudiced or damaged the
indemnifying party with respect to that Indemnity Claim.

 



53 ---|--- 

__The indemnifying party shall be entitled, at its cost and expense, to
contest and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings any Indemnity Claim
for which it is called upon to indemnify the indemnified party under the
provisions of this Agreement; _provided_ , that notice of the intention to so
contest shall be delivered by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party
within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt by the indemnifying party of
notice by the indemnified party of the assertion of the Indemnity Claim. Any
such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the indemnifying
party or the indemnified party as may be appropriate. Such contest shall be
conducted by reputable counsel employed by the indemnifying party and not
reasonably objected to by the indemnified party, but the indemnified party
shall have the right but not the obligation to participate in such proceedings
and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at its sole cost and
expense. __

 

 __The indemnifying party shall have full authority to determine all action to
be taken with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnifying
party will not have the authority to subject the indemnified party to any
obligation whatsoever, other than the performance of purely ministerial tasks
or obligations not involving material expense or injunctive relief. If
the indemnifying party does not elect to contest any such Indemnity Claim,
the indemnifying party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect
thereto by the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party assumes the
defense of an Indemnity Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of an Indemnity Claim that the
indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the
indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Indemnity Claim, which releases the indemnified party completely in
connection with such Indemnity Claim and which would not otherwise adversely
affect the indemnified party as determined by the indemnified party in its
sole discretion.  __

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Indemnity Claim (and shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified party in
defending such Indemnity Claim) if the Indemnity Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages
against the indemnified party which the indemnified party reasonably
determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated
from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other
relief portion of the Indemnity Claim can be so separated from that for money
damages, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the
portion relating to money damages.



   9.7 | _Cooperation_. 
---|--- 

If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party agrees to
cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in contesting any
Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest or, if
appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting the
Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person, and the
indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for any expenses
incurred by it in so cooperating. At no cost or expense to the indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified party and
its counsel in contesting any Indemnity Claim.

 



54 ---|--- 

The indemnified party agrees to afford the indemnifying party and its counsel
the opportunity to be present at, and to participate in, conferences with all
Persons, including Governmental Authorities, asserting any Indemnity Claim
against the indemnified party or conferences with representatives of or
counsel for such Persons. 



   9.9 | _Payment of Damages_. 
---|---

3\. Article V is hereby amended to add a new Section 5.13 as follows:

__"Section 5.13 _Establishment of Class D Units_

 

(a) The General Partner hereby designates and creates a series of Units to be
designated as "Class D Units," having the terms and conditions set forth
herein.

(b) The holders of the Class D Units shall have rights upon dissolution
and liquidation of the Partnership, including the right to share in any
liquidating distributions pursuant to Section 12.4, in accordance with Article
XII.

 

(c) _Issuance of Class D Units_. Class D Units shall initially be issued as
contemplated by Article 2 of the WECU Contribution Agreement pursuant to the
terms and conditions thereof. Additional Class D Units shall be issued either
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Class D Unit Put Option or
pursuant to a Class D Unit Distribution.

 

(i) Upon the initial issuance of Class D Units as provided in Article 2 of the
WECU Contribution Agreement, the General Partners capital account shall be
adjusted and General Partner Units shall be issued to the General Partner
pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof.

 

(ii) Upon the issuance of Class D Units pursuant to the Class D Unit Put
Option, the General Partners capital account shall be adjusted and General
Partner Units shall be issued to the General Partner pursuant to the terms and
conditions of Section 5.6(a) of the WECU Contribution Agreement. (iii) Upon the issuance of Class D Units pursuant to a Class D Unit
Distribution, the General Partner may, in exchange for a proportionate number
of General Partner Units to maintain its Percentage Interest as of such date,
make an additional Capital Contribution in an amount equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the
Percentage Interest of the General Partner immediately prior to such issuance,
by (2) a percentage equal to 100%, less such Percentage Interest and (y) the
amount contributed to the Partnership by the holders of Class D Units in
exchange for such issuance of Class D Units. Class D Unit Distributions will
be treated solely for purposes of this Section 5.13(c)(iii) as if the cash
equivalent of such Class D Units had been distributed to the holder of the
Class D Units and thereafter recontributed by such holder to the Partnership
in exchange for such issuance of Class D Units.

 

(d) _Conversion of Class D Units_

 

 __(i) Effective on the business day after the record date for the
distribution on Common Units for the fiscal quarter ending December 31,
2015, each Class D Unit shall become convertible at the election of the holder
thereof or the Partnership into a Common Unit on a one-for-one basis by
delivery of written notice to the Partnership or the holder thereof,
as applicable, setting forth the number of Class D Units held by the holder,
the number of Class D Units it is electing to convert, and other applicable
information as may be reasonably requested by the Partnership or the holder
thereof, as applicable (such date on which a holder or the Partnership elects
to convert a Class D Unit, a " _Class D Conversion Date_ "). If such Class D
Units are Certificated, a Class D Unit Certificate shall be delivered by the
holder to the Transfer Agent representing an amount of Class D Units at least
equal to the amount such holder or the Partnership, as applicable, is electing
to convert (or an instruction letter shall be delivered by the holder to the
Transfer Agent if the Class D Units are in book-entry form), together with
such additional information as may be requested by the Transfer Agent.
Thereafter, the Partnership shall take commercially reasonable steps to
complete the conversion in accordance with this Section 5.13(d). In the case
of any Certificate representing Class D Units which are converted in part
only, upon such conversion the Transfer Agent shall authenticate and deliver
to the holder of Class D Units thereof, at the expense of the Partnership, a
new Certificate representing the number of Class D Units not so converted. __

(ii) Upon conversion, the rights of a holder of converted Class D Units as
holder of Class D Units shall cease with respect to such converted Class D
Units, including any rights under this Agreement with respect to holders of
Class D Units, and such Person shall continue to be a Limited Partner and
have the rights of a holder of Common Units under this Agreement with respect
to the Common Units received in such conversion. Each Class D Unit shall, upon
its Class D Conversion Date, be deemed to be transferred to, and cancelled
by, the Partnership in exchange for the issuance of the Common Unit into which
such Class D Unit converted. (iii) The Partnership shall pay any documentary, stamp or similar issue
or transfer taxes or duties relating to the issuance or delivery of Common
Units upon conversion of the Class D Units. However, the holder shall pay any
tax or duty that may be payable relating to any transfer involving the
issuance or delivery of Common Units in a name other than the holders name.
The Transfer Agent may refuse to deliver the Certificate representing Common
Units (or notation of book entry) being issued in a name other than the
holders name until the Transfer Agent receives a sum sufficient to pay any
tax or duties which will be due because the Common Units are to be issued in a
name other than the holders name. Nothing herein shall preclude any tax
withholding required by law or regulation.

 

(iv)(A) The Partnership shall keep free from preemptive rights a sufficient
number of Common Units to permit the conversion of all Outstanding Class D
Units into Common Units to the extent provided in, and in accordance with,
this Section 5.13(d).

 

(B) All Common Units delivered upon conversion of the Class D Units shall be
newly issued, shall be duly authorized and validly issued, and shall be free
from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim.

(C) The Partnership shall comply with all applicable securities laws
regulating the offer and delivery of any Common Units upon conversion of Class
D Units and, if the Common Units are then listed or quoted on the New York
Stock Exchange, or any other National Securities Exchange or other market,
shall list or cause to have quoted and keep listed and quoted the Common Units
issuable upon conversion of the Class D Units to the extent permitted or
required by the rules of such exchange or market.

 

(D) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein shall give
to any holder of Class D Units any rights as a creditor in respect of its
right to conversion.

(e) _Allocations_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, during the
period commencing upon issuance of the Class D Units and ending on the Class D
Conversion Date, all items of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction and
credit, including Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss to be allocated to
the Partners pursuant to Section 6.1(c), shall be allocated to the Class D
Units to the same extent as such items would be so allocated if such Class D
Units were Common Units that were then Outstanding. (f) _Distributions_.

 

 __(i) Prior to the Class D Conversion Date, the Class D Units shall not be
entitled to receive distributions of Available Cash pursuant to Section
6.3(a). Class D Units shall receive distributions of paid-in-kind additional
Class D Units (such distribution, a " _Class D Unit Distribution_ ") for each
distribution period that distributions are made with respect to Common Units,
including distributions for Common Unit Arrearages. __

__(ii) The number of Class D Units to be issued with respect to each Class D
Unit in connection with a Class D Unit Distribution shall be the quotient of
(A) the amount of the distribution declared for a Common Unit for the
applicable distribution period divided by (B) the VWAP Price calculated as of
the date such quarterly distribution on all Units is declared; _provided_ that
instead of issuing any fractional Class D Units to a holder of Class D Units,
the Partnership shall round the aggregate number of Class D Units issued to
such holder down to the next lower whole Class D Unit and pay cash in lieu of
such fractional units, or at the Partnerships option, the Partnership may
round the number of Class D Units issued up to the next higher whole Class D
Unit. Any Class D Units issued pursuant to this Section 5.13(f) shall have all
rights of a Class D Unit, including rights to distributions in any period
subsequent to such Class D Unit issuance. __

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.13(f) to the contrary, with
respect to Class D Units that are converted into Common Units, the holder
thereof shall not be entitled to a Class D Unit Distribution and a Common Unit
distribution with respect to the same distribution period, but shall be
entitled only to the distribution to be paid based upon the class of Units
held as of the close of business on the applicable Record Date.

(iv) For each Class D Unit Distribution, the Partnership shall issue the
Class D Units to such holder no later than the date the corresponding
distributions are made on the Common Units for such distribution period. The
Partnership shall issue to such holder of Class D Units by notation in book
entry form in the books of the Transfer Agent, or at the election of such
holder, a physical certificate.

(v) Subject to and without limiting the other provisions of this Section
5.13, and subject to Section 12.4(c), each Class D Unit shall have the right
to share in distributions of cash, securities or other property and in the
form of such cash, securities or other property (other than distributions
pursuant to Section 6.3(a)) on a Pro Rata basis with the Common Units as if
the Class D Units had converted to Common Units.

 

(g) _Voting Rights_. The Class D Units will have such voting rights pursuant
to the Agreement as such Class D Units would have if they were Common Units
that were then Outstanding and shall vote together with the Common Units as a
single class, except that the Class D Units shall be entitled to vote as a
separate class on any matter on which Unitholders are entitled to vote that
adversely affects the rights or preferences of the Class D Units in relation
to other classes of Partnership Interests in any material respect or as
required by law. The approval of a majority of the Class D Units shall be
required to approve any matter for which the holders of the Class D Units are
entitled to vote as a separate class. (h) _Merger and other Extraordinary Transactions_. Subject to Section
12.4(c), if (1) there shall be (a) a statutory unit exchange, consolidation,
merger or combination involving the Partnership, other than a merger in which
the Partnership is the continuing partnership and which does not result in
any change (other than as a result of a subdivision or combination pursuant
Section 6.3(e)) in Outstanding Common Units; or (b) a sale or conveyance as an
entirety or substantially as an entirety of the property and assets of
the Partnership, directly or indirectly, to another Person; and (2) pursuant
to such statutory unit exchange, consolidation, merger, combination, sale or
conveyance, Outstanding Common Units are converted or exchanged into or for
stock (other than Common Units), other securities, other property, assets or
cash, then each Class D Unit (including the Class D Units issued as a
distribution) shall, as a condition precedent to such statutory unit exchange,
consolidation, merger, combination, sale or conveyance, be converted into a
Common Unit on a one-for-one basis; provided, however, notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Unitholder shall receive consideration which is greater in
amount than the balance of such Unitholders Capital Account after taking
into account all adjustments, including allocations of income, gain, loss and
deduction through the date of such merger or other extraordinary transaction."

 

4\. Article V is hereby amended to add a new Section 5.14 as follows:

 

 __"Section 5.14 _Transfers of Class D Units_. The transfer of a Class D Unit
shall be subject to Section 4.8, Section 6.1(d)(x)(B) and Section 6.11." __

5\. Section 6.1(d) is hereby amended to amend and restate Section
6.1(d)(iii)(A) and to add new Sections 6.1(d)(iii)(C) and (D) as follows:

__"(A) If the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of any property
distributed (except cash or property distributed pursuant to Section 5.13 or
Section 12.4) with respect to a Unit (other than a Class D Unit) exceeds the
amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of property distributed with respect
to another Unit (the amount of the excess, an " _Excess Distribution_ " and
the Unit with respect to which the greater distribution is paid, an " _Excess
Distribution Unit_ "), then (1) there shall be allocated gross income and
gain to each Unitholder receiving an Excess Distribution with respect to the
Excess Distribution Unit until the aggregate amount of such items allocated
with respect to such Excess Distribution Unit pursuant to this Section
6.1(d)(iii)(A) for the current taxable period and all previous taxable periods
is equal to the amount of the Excess Distribution; and (2) the General Partner
shall be allocated gross income and gain with respect to each such Excess
Distribution in an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (aa)
the quotient determined by dividing (x) the General Partners Percentage
Interest at the time when the Excess Distribution occurs by (y) a percentage
equal to 100% less the General Partners Percentage Interest at the time when
the Excess Distribution occurs, times (bb) the total amount allocated in
clause (1) above with respect to such Excess Distribution. __ (C) With respect to the first taxable period of the Partnership ending upon,
or after, the date of issuance of the Class D Units, and each taxable period
of the Partnership thereafter, items of gross income, gain, loss or deduction
for such taxable period shall be allocated among the Partners in such a manner
as to cause the Per Unit Capital Amount of each Partner with respect to its
Class D Units outstanding as of the time of such event to equal, as closely as
possible, the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then outstanding Common Unit.

 

(D) With respect to any taxable period of the Partnership ending upon, or
after, a Class D Conversion Date, and after the application of Section
6.1(d)(iii)(A), (B) and (C), Net Income or Net Loss for such taxable period
shall be allocated among the Partners in such a manner as to cause the Per
Unit Capital Amount of each Partner with respect to a Common Unit converted
from a Class D Unit that is outstanding as of the time of such event to equal,
as closely as possible, the Per Unit Capital Amount for a then outstanding
Common Unit."

 

 __6\. Section 6.1(d) is hereby amended to add the reference "(A)" following
the heading " _Economic Uniformity_ " appearing therein and to add a new
Section 6.1(d)(x)(B) as follows: __

"(B) For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the
preservation of uniformity of the Limited Partner Interests (or any class or
classes thereof), the General Partner shall (i) adopt such conventions as it
deems appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and
cost recovery deductions; (ii) make special allocations of income, gain, loss,
deduction, Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss; and (iii) amend the provisions
of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation
of Treasury Regulations under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or
(y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of the Limited Partner
Interests (or any class or classes thereof). The General Partner may adopt
such conventions, make such allocations and make such amendments to this
Agreement as provided in this Section 6.1(d)(x)(B) only if such conventions,
allocations or amendments would not have a material adverse effect on the
Partners, the holders of any class or classes of Limited Partner Interests
issued and Outstanding or the Partnership, and if such allocations are
consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the Code."

 

7\. Article VI is hereby amended to add a new Section 6.3(e) as follows:

 

 __"(e) For the avoidance of doubt, upon any _pro rata_ distribution of
Partnership Interests to all Record Holders of Common Units or any
subdivision or combination (or reclassified into a greater or smaller number)
of Common Units, the Partnership will proportionately adjust the number of
Class D Units as follows: (a) if the Partnership issues Partnership Interests
as a distribution on its Common Units or subdivides the __  Common Units (or reclassifies them into a greater number of Common Units)
then the Class D Units shall be subdivided into a number of Class D Units
equal to the result of multiplying the number of Class D Units by a fraction,
(A) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of Common Units
Outstanding immediately prior to such distribution or subdivision plus the
total number of Partnership Interests constituting such distribution or newly
created by such subdivision; and (B) the denominator of which shall be the
number of Common Units Outstanding immediately prior to such distribution or
subdivision; and (b) if the Partnership combines the Common Units (or
reclassifies them into a smaller number of Common Units) then the Class D
Units shall be combined into a number of Class D Units equal to the result of
multiplying the number of Class D Units by a fraction, (A) the numerator of
which shall be the sum of the number of Common Units Outstanding immediately
following such combination; and (B) the denominator of which shall be the
number of Common Units Outstanding immediately prior to such combination."

Reduction Quarter or (B) if the amount of Available Cash otherwise
distributable to the holder of the Incentive Distribution Rights pursuant to
Section 6.4 with respect to the WECU Final Consideration Adjustment Reduction
Quarter is less than the sum of (x) the WECU Final Consideration Adjustment
Amount Difference and (y) the Suncor Adjustment Amount Difference, an amount
equal to the WECU Final Consideration Adjustment Quarterly Reduction Amount
with respect to each Quarter within the WECU Final Consideration Adjustment

9\. Article VI is hereby amended to add a new Section 6.11 as follows:

 

Section 6.11 Special Provisions Relating to the Holders of Class D Units.

 

 __(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the holder of a Class D
Unit shall have all of the rights and obligations of a Unitholder holding
Common Units hereunder; _provided, however_ , that immediately upon the
conversion of any Class D Unit into Common Units pursuant to Section 5.13(d),
the Unitholder holding a Class D Unit that is to be converted shall possess
all of the rights and obligations of a Unitholder holding Common Units
hereunder, including the right to vote as a Common Unitholder and the right to
participate in allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction
and distributions made with respect to Common Units; _provided, however_ ,
that such converted Class D shall remain subject to the provisions of Section
6.1(d)(iii)(C) and Section 6.11(c). __

 

(b) Subject to the transfer restrictions in Section 4.8, a Unitholder holding
a Class D Unit shall be required to provide notice to the General Partner of
the transfer of the Class D Unit at any time during the earlier of (i) thirty
(30) days following such transfer and (ii) the last Business Day of the
calendar year during which such transfer occurred, unless the transfer is to
an Affiliate of the holder.

(c) A Unitholder holding a Common Unit that has resulted from the conversion
of a Class D Unit pursuant to Section 5.13(d) shall not be issued a Common
Unit Certificate pursuant to Section 4.1, if the Common Units are evidenced by
Certificates, and shall not be permitted to transfer such Common Unit to
a Person that is not an Affiliate of the holder until such time as the
General Partner determines, based on advice of counsel, that each such Common
Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like intrinsic economic and federal
income tax characteristics, in all material respects, to the intrinsic
economic and federal income tax characteristics of an Initial Common Unit. In

foregoing to amounts that are mutually agreeable to both the parties hereto
and to the taxing authority or authorities and, failing agreement, to amounts

ARTICLE 3  TAX MATTERS

 

Section 3.1 Income Tax Act Election

 

WECU and PDH ULC shall execute jointly and file an election pursuant to
subsection 85(1) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) within the prescribed time
under subsection 85(6) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) electing to transfer
each of the Transferred Assets at an elected transfer amount (the "Elected
Amount") as WECU may determine, subject to the several limitations of
subsection 85(1) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada).

Section 3.2 Provincial Income Tax Elections

 

WECU and PDH ULC agree that in connection with the joint election filed
pursuant to subsection 85(1) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) they shall also
file such provincial election forms as may be required in respect of all
provincial taxes that may apply to them so that the Elected Amounts shall also
be applicable for all provincial tax returns of both WECU and PDH ULC.

 



\- 5 - Section 3.3 Price Readjustment

 

It is intended by the parties hereto that the Purchase Price shall be the fair
market value of the Transferred Assets, the Elected Amount shall be the lower
of the fair market value or the cost amount (as defined in Section 248(1) of
the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada)) of the Transferred Assets to WECU and the
Stated Capital shall be the paid-up-capital of the Share Consideration on the
date hereof. The parties hereto have made a reasonable effort to determine
these values. In the event that any taxing authority disputes the fair market
value, the Elected Amount or the Stated Capital, the parties hereto agree to
adjust these amounts and the Share Consideration or any or all of the
foregoing to amounts that are mutually agreeable to both the parties hereto
and to the taxing authority or authorities and, failing agreement, to amounts
determined by a court of law with competent jurisdiction, and to adjust the
accounts of WECU and PDH ULC accordingly. The parties hereto further agree to
file any amended election form and pay any penalty as may be necessary to give
full force and effect to the foregoing.

 

Section 3.4 Goods and Services Tax

 

PDH ULC shall be liable for and shall pay all goods and services tax imposed
pursuant to Part IX of the _Excise Tax Act _ (Canada) ("GST") properly
applicable in connection with the transfer of the Transferred Assets pursuant
to this Agreement. WECU declares that it is duly registered for the purpose of
the GST as 86119 3126. PDH ULC declares that it is duly registered for the
purposes of the GST as 83116 0775. PDH ULC declares that it is acquiring under
this Agreement all or substantially all of the property that can reasonably be
regarded as being necessary for it to carry on the Project as a business.
WECU and PDH ULC shall jointly make the election provided for under subsection
167(1.1) of the _Excise Tax Act_ (Canada) so that no GST will be payable in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. PDH ULC and WECU
shall jointly complete the election form (more particularly described as form
GST-44) in respect of such election PDH ULC irrevocably appoints WECU (or its
authorized representatives) as its agent to file the said election form no
later than the due date for the PDH ULCs GST return for the first reporting
period in which GST would, in the absence of such election, become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

---|---|--- 
 



     | B. | WECU requires personnel to perform certain services to
operate the Business and to fulfill other general and administrative functions
relating to the Business (the "Services"). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | C. | WCES has agreed to provide such personnel in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, and WECU is willing to engage WCES subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 

NOW, THEREFORE in consideration of the foregoing recitals, which are
incorporated herein by this reference, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:



     | _1._  | _Services._ WCES shall, during the term of this
Agreement, provide to WECU such employees (the "Assigned Employees") to
perform the Services. Such Assigned Employees will have the requisite
skills, knowledge, training, experience, and competence to provide the
Services. 
---|---|--- 



     | _2._  | _Employer Obligation._ WCES is the sole employer of the
Assigned Employees for all purposes, and WECU shall not be the employer or
common employer for any purpose.

     | _3._  | _Employee Compensation_. WCES shall be responsible for
the payment of any and all wages and other compensation to all of the Assigned
Employees. In this regard, it is the responsibility of WCES to

paid under this Agreement including, but not limited to: (i) federal income
tax withholding provisions of the Income Tax Act; (ii) provincial and/or

each month, WCES shall notify WECU, in a mutually agreeable electronic format
(e.g., e-mail, fax), of the Payment Amount due for the prior month. WECU
shall pay WCES such amount on or before the last day of the month of
notification. Any payments not received by this date shall bear interest at an
arms length rate of interest (as determined under US Internal Revenue Code
Section 482 or Section 247 of Canadas Income Tax Act) from the date due until
the date of payment. The Payment Amount shall be in Canadian dollars and all
payments shall be remitted in Canadian dollars.  
---|---|--- 



     | _8._  | _Benefit Plans._ WCES, directly or through its
Affiliates, may adopt and participate in employee benefit plans, employee
programs, and employee practices (including paid time off payments, severance,
retiree medical, retiree life, equity related awards, bonuses, vesting of
employee benefits, retirement plans, and other employee or retiree related
payments, obligations, liabilities or benefits) (collectively, "Plans and
Practices"), in each case for the benefit of employees, former employees, and
directors of WCES or any of its Affiliates, in respect of Services performed,
directly or indirectly, for the benefit of WECU. WCES, directly or through its
Affiliates, has adopted and participates in (or in the future may adopt and
participate in) Plans and Practices for the benefit of employees and former
employees of WECU, the predecessor of WECU, and their Affiliates, in respect
of services previously performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of
WECU or its predecessor. Any and all expenses incurred or accrued by WCES or
its Affiliates in connection with any such Plans and Practices shall be
reimbursed by WECU in accordance with the procedures described in Section 6
and 7. 
---|---|--- 
 



-2- may receive information that is proprietary to or confidential to the other
party or its affiliated companies and their clients. Both parties agree to
hold such information in strict confidence and not to disclose such
information to third parties, other than the Partnership Parties or the
Contributing Parties, or to use such information for any purpose whatsoever
other than performing under this Agreement or as required by law. 
---|---|--- 



     | _10._  | _Permitted Disclosure._ Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by a
court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority or otherwise
as required by law, including without limitation disclosure obligations
imposed under the federal securities laws, provided that such party has given
the other party prior notice of such requirement when legally permissible to
permit the other party to take such legal action to prevent the disclosure as
it deems reasonable, appropriate or necessary. 
---|---|--- 



     | _11._  | __ _Term._ Unless terminated earlier as provided below,
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect except that (a) each
party may terminate this Agreement upon 60 days advance written notice to
the other party, and (b) WCES or WECU may terminate this Agreement immediately
upon written notice to the other party at such time as neither WCES nor its
successor in interest is an affiliate of WECU or its successor in interest. 
---|---|--- 



     | _12._  | __ _Termination for Breach._ If a party shall be in
breach of any provision of this Agreement (the "Breaching Party"), the non-
breaching party ("Non-breaching Party") shall give the Breaching Party
written notice of such breach (the "Notice"), and, subject to the terms of
this Section, the Breaching Party shall have 30 days after receipt of the
Notice within which to cure the breach, except that no Notice shall be
required and this Agreement may be terminated with immediate effect if (a) the
breach is an obligation to pay money, in which case the Breaching Party shall
have ten business days to cure the breach; (b) the same breach occurs in any
six-month period; (c) the breach pertains to the Breaching Partys obligations
under Section 9; or (d) a party files a petition in Bankruptcy (or is the
subject of an involuntary petition in Bankruptcy that is not dismissed within
60 days after the effective filing date thereof). With respect to a breach of
the obligations of a Breaching Party contained in Section 9, there is no
adequate remedy at law, and the Non-Breaching Party will suffer irreparable
harm as a result of such a breach. Therefore, if a breach or threatened
breach by a Breaching Party of Section 9 occurs, the Non-Breaching Party shall
be entitled to injunctive relief restraining the breaching party from doing
any act in violation thereof without the obligation of posting a bond, cash,
or otherwise. 
---|---|--- 



     | _13._  |

_Effect of Termination._ If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 11 or 12, all rights and obligations under this Agreement shall cease
except for (a) obligations that expressly survive termination of this
Agreement; (b) liabilities and obligations that have accrued prior to such
termination, including the obligation to pay any amounts that have become due
and payable prior to such termination, (c) the obligation to pay any portion
of the Payment Amount that has accrued prior to such termination, even if such
portion has not become due and payable at that time, and (d) all liabilities
and other obligations attributable, or in any way related to, employees and
former employees of WCES, to the extent that such employees and former
employees provided Services to WECU, and former employees of WECU, and the
predecessors in interest of each and the estates, heirs, personal 

---|---|--- 
 



-3- employee and former employee (each, a "Subject Employee") including with
respect to current and former Plans and Practices and any benefit, equity, or
incentive related plans, programs, policies, or practices of WECU or its
predecessors, all of which shall be paid when due by WECU, recognizing that
the amount of some of such liabilities and other obligations shall not be
known at the time of termination of this Agreement and the obligation to pay
shall continue after such termination. 
---|--- 



     | _14._  | __ _Release._ WECU, for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates, and the predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns of each,

16: (a) the term Affiliate means any individual or corporation, limited

whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and
from and after the closing of the transactions contemplated by the
Contribution Agreement by and among The Williams Companies, Inc. and Williams
Partners L.P., and certain of their respective affiliates contemplated to be
signed in February 2014 (the "Contribution Agreement") (b) the term Affiliate,
when used in reference to WCES, shall exclude WECU, including all of the
"Partnership Parties" and their respective "Affiliates" as defined in the

     | _16._  |

_Indemnification Obligations._ WECU, for itself and on behalf of its
Affiliates, and the predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns of each

WECU Indemnifying Party, or (b) any action or omission, including negligence

Party") from and against all Damages sustained or incurred as a result of or
arising out of or by virtue of any claim made by a third party against a WECU

negligence or willful misconduct of a WCES Indemnifying Party. 
---|--- 



     | _17._  | __ _Procedure._ Each of WCES and WECU shall give the
other party prompt written notice and information in such partys possession
concerning any claim that could result in Damages. In performing its

direct loss or damages incurred, or (b) the amount paid to WCES in excess of
reimbursement for direct and indirect costs in performance of the Services.
All claims against WCES shall be deemed waived unless made by WECU in writing

Agreement, other than an obligation to pay money and the indemnification
obligations hereunder, shall be excused when and to the extent
its performance of that obligation is prevented due to any cause beyond the
reasonable control of a party, including the following causes (unless they are
within such partys reasonable control): acts of God, strikes, lockouts, acts

arrests and other restraints of government (civil or military), blockades,

reason of one or more of the foregoing events (the "Delayed Party") shall
promptly notify the other party of that fact and shall exercise due diligence
to end its inability to perform as promptly as practicable. However, in no
event shall a Delayed Party be required to settle any strike, lockout, or
other labor dispute in which it may be involved, but in the event of a
strike, lockout, or other labor dispute affecting WCES, WCES shall use
reasonable efforts to continue to perform the Services by utilizing its
management personnel and that of its Affiliates.

rights, or delegate any of its obligations, under this Agreement to
any Person without the prior consent of the other party except that such
prior consent shall not be required if such sale, assignment, or transfer is

     | C. | WHO requires personnel to perform certain services to operate
the Business and to fulfill other general and administrative functions
relating to the Business, as well as certain office space and equipment
relating to the operation of the Business (the " _Services_ "). 
---|---|--- 



     | D. | WECU has agreed to provide such Services and allocate these
costs to WHO in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and WHO is
willing to engage WECU subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.  
---|---|--- 

NOW, THEREFORE in consideration of the foregoing recitals, which are
incorporated herein by this reference, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties agree as follows:



     | _1._  | _Services._ WECU shall, during the term of this
Agreement, provide to WHO such employees (the " _Assigned Employees_ ") to
perform the Services. Such Assigned Employees will have the requisite skills,
knowledge, training, experience, and competence to provide the Services. WECU
shall enforce and perform under the WCES Personnel Agreement so as to permit
WECU to perform its obligations under this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | _2._  | _Employer Obligation._ The Parties acknowledge WCES is
the sole employer of the Assigned Employees for all purposes. WHO shall not be
the employer or common employer for any purpose. 
---|---|--- for ensuring the payment by WCES of any and all wages and other compensation
to all of the Assigned Employees. In this regard, it is the responsibility
of WECU to ensure implementation by WCES of procedures that comply with rules
and regulations governing the reporting and payment of all federal and
provincial taxes on payroll wages paid under this Agreement including, but not
limited to: (i) federal income tax withholding provisions of the Income Tax
Act; (ii) provincial and/or local income tax withholding provisions, if
applicable; (iii) Employment Insurance premiums; and (iv) Canada Pension Plan

books, records, files and other statements, documents or instruments
reasonably relating to the services to be provided hereunder.

     | _6._  | _Payment to WECU._ WHO shall pay WECU, subject to the
terms of section 7 below, an amount equal to all direct and indirect expenses

benefits, withholding and employment taxes and other amounts paid to or on
behalf of any Assigned Employee and office space, equipment and other general
and administrative costs) to perform the Services (collectively, the "

This Personnel Services and Allocation Agreement ("Agreement") is effective as

liability corporation, and Williams Energy Canada Development ULC ("Williams
Development").

 

RECITALS



     | A. | Williams Development is in the business of extracting,
fractionating, storing and transporting natural gas liquids and olefins (the
"Business"). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | B. | Effective as of January 1, 2014, WECU entered into a
Personnel Services Agreement with Williams Canada Employee Services Inc.
("WCES"), an Alberta unlimited liability corporation pursuant to which
WCES will provide personnel to perform certain services to operate WECUs
business and to fulfill other general and administrative functions relating to
WECUs business (the "WCES Personnel Agreement"). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | C. | Williams Development requires personnel to perform certain
services to operate the Business and to fulfill other general and
administrative functions relating to the Business, as well as certain office
space and equipment relating to the operation of the Business (the "
_Services_ "). 
---|---|--- 



     | D. | WECU has agreed to provide such Services and allocate these
costs to Williams Development in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
and Williams Development is willing to engage WECU subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

NOW, THEREFORE in consideration of the foregoing recitals, which are
incorporated herein by this reference, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties agree as follows:



     | _1._  | _Services._ WECU shall, during the term of this
Agreement, provide to Williams Development such employees (the " _Assigned
Employees_ ") to perform the Services. Such Assigned Employees will have the
requisite skills, knowledge, training, experience, and competence to provide
the Services. WECU shall enforce and perform under the WCES Personnel
Agreement so as to permit WECU to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.  
---|---|--- 



     | _2._  | _Employer Obligation._ The Parties acknowledge WCES is
the sole employer of the Assigned Employees for all purposes. Williams
Development shall not be the employer or common employer for any purpose.  
---|---|--- for ensuring the payment by WCES of any and all wages and other compensation
to all of the Assigned Employees. In this regard, it is the responsibility
of WECU to ensure implementation by WCES of procedures that comply with rules
and regulations governing the reporting and payment of all federal and
provincial taxes on payroll wages paid under this Agreement including, but not
limited to: (i) federal income tax withholding provisions of the Income Tax
Act; (ii) provincial and/or local income tax withholding provisions, if
applicable; (iii) Employment Insurance premiums; and (iv) Canada Pension Plan
contributions. In addition, WCES shall be the rated employer for unemployment
compensation purposes with respect to the Assigned Employees. 
---|---|--- 



     | _4._  | _Intellectual Property._ Any (i) inventions, whether
patentable or not, developed or invented, or (ii) copyrightable material (and
the intangible rights of copyright therein) developed, by the Assigned
Employees in connection with the performance of the Services shall be the
property of Williams Development. 
---|---|--- 



     | _5._  | _Books and Records._ WECU shall maintain accurate books
and records regarding the performance of the Services and its calculation of
the Payment Amount, as defined below, and shall maintain such books
and records for the period required by applicable accounting practices or
Law. Each party shall at all reasonable times have access to the other partys
books, records, files and other statements, documents or instruments
reasonably relating to the services to be provided hereunder. 
---|---|--- 



     | _6._  | _Payment to WECU._ Williams Development shall pay WECU,
subject to the terms of section 7 below, an amount equal to all direct and
indirect expenses WECU incurs (including, but not limited to, salary,
bonus, benefits, withholding and employment taxes and other amounts paid to
or on behalf of any Assigned Employee and office space, equipment and other
general and administrative costs) to perform the Services (collectively, the "
_Payment Amount_ "). The allocation methodology WECU uses to allocate
expenses to Williams Development shall satisfy US Internal Revenue Code
Section 482 and Section 247 of Canadas Income Tax Act. As deemed necessary by
WECU, the Payment Amount may include an additional arms length fee or mark-
up, as required under US Internal Revenue Code Section 482 and Section 247 of
Canadas Income Tax Act. Payments pursuant to this Section shall be in
addition to any payment to WECU as a result of indemnification pursuant to
any other Section in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | _7._  | _Payment Terms_. On or before the 10th calendar day of
each month, WECU shall notify Williams Development, in a mutually agreeable
electronic format (e.g., e-mail, fax), of the Payment Amount due for the
prior month. Williams Development shall pay WECU such amount on or before the
last day of the month of notification. Any payments not received by this date
shall bear interest at an arms length rate of interest (as determined under
US Internal Revenue Code Section 482 or Section 247 of Canadas Income Tax
Act) from the date due until the date of payment. The Payment Amount shall be
in Canadian dollars and all payments shall be remitted in Canadian dollars. 
---|---|--- 
 



-2- adopt and participate in employee benefit plans, employee programs, and
employee practices (including paid time off payments, severance, retiree
medical, retiree life, equity related awards, bonuses, vesting of employee
benefits, retirement plans, and other employee or retiree related payments,
obligations, liabilities or benefits) (collectively, " _Plans and Practices_
"), in each case for the benefit of employees, former employees, and
directors of WCES or any of its Affiliates, in respect of Services performed,
directly or indirectly, for the benefit of WILLIAMS DEVELOPMENT. The Parties
acknowledge that WCES, directly or through its Affiliates, has adopted and
participates in (or in the future may adopt and participate in) Plans and
Practices for the benefit of employees and former employees of WECU, the
predecessor of WECU, and their Affiliates, in respect of services previously
performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of WECU and Williams
Development or its predecessors. Any and all expenses incurred or accrued by
WECU or its Affiliates in connection with any such Plans and Practices, to the
extent they relate to the Assigned Employees, shall be reimbursed by Williams
Development in accordance with the procedures described in Section 6 and 7. 
---|---|--- 



     | _9._  | _Confidential Information._ Each of WECU and Williams
Development may receive information that is proprietary to or confidential to
the other party or its affiliated companies and their clients. Both
parties agree to hold such information in strict confidence and not to
disclose such information to third parties, other than the Partnership Parties
or the Contributing Parties, or to use such information for any purpose
whatsoever other than performing under this Agreement or as required by law. 
---|---|--- 



     | _10._  | _Permitted Disclosure._ Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by a
court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority or otherwise
as required by law, including without limitation disclosure obligations
imposed under the federal securities laws, provided that such party has given
the other party prior notice of such requirement when legally permissible to
permit the other party to take such legal action to prevent the disclosure as
it deems reasonable, appropriate or necessary. 
---|---|--- 



     | _11._  | _Term._ Unless terminated earlier as provided below,
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect except that (a) each
party may terminate this Agreement upon 60 days advance written notice to
the other party, and (b) WECU or Williams Development may terminate this
Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party at such time as
neither WECU nor its successor in interest is an affiliate of Williams
Development or its successor in interest. 
---|---|--- 



     | _12._  |

_Termination for Breach._ If a party shall be in breach of any provision of
this Agreement (the " _Breaching Party_ "), the non-breaching party (" _Non-
breaching Party_ ") shall give the Breaching Party written notice of such
breach (the " _Notice_ "), and, subject to the terms of this Section, the
Breaching Party shall have 30 days after receipt of the Notice within which
to cure the breach, except that no Notice shall be required and this Agreement
may be terminated with immediate effect if (a) the breach is an obligation to
pay money, in which case the Breaching Party shall have ten business days to
cure the breach; (b) the same 

---|---|--- 
 



-3- pertains to the Breaching Partys obligations under Section 9; or (d) a party
files a petition in Bankruptcy (or is the subject of an involuntary petition
in Bankruptcy that is not dismissed within 60 days after the effective filing
date thereof). With respect to a breach of the obligations of a Breaching
Party contained in Section 9, there is no adequate remedy at law, and the
Non-Breaching Party will suffer irreparable harm as a result of such a breach.
Therefore, if a breach or threatened breach by a Breaching Party of Section 9
occurs, the Non-Breaching Party shall be entitled to injunctive
relief restraining the breaching party from doing any act in violation
thereof without the obligation of posting a bond, cash, or otherwise. 
---|--- 



     | _13._  | _Effect of Termination._ If this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 11 or 12, all rights and obligations
under this Agreement shall cease except for (a) obligations that
expressly survive termination of this Agreement; (b) liabilities and
obligations that have accrued prior to such termination, including the
obligation to pay any amounts that have become due and payable prior to such
termination, (c) the obligation to pay any portion of the Payment Amount that
has accrued prior to such termination, even if such portion has not become due
and payable at that time, and (d) all liabilities and other obligations
attributable, or in any way related to, employees and former employees of
WCES, to the extent that such employees and former employees provided Services
to Williams Development , and former employees of Williams Development , and
the predecessors in interest of each and the estates, heirs, personal
representatives, successors, and assigns of each such employee and former
employee (each, a " _Subject Employee_ ") including with respect to current
and former Plans and Practices and any benefit, equity, or incentive related
plans, programs, policies, or practices of Williams Development or its
predecessors, all of which shall be paid when due by Williams Development ,
recognizing that the amount of some of such liabilities and other obligations
shall not be known at the time of termination of this Agreement and the
obligation to pay shall continue after such termination. 
---|---|--- 



     | _14._  | _Release._ Williams Development , for itself and on
behalf of its Affiliates, and the predecessors in interest, successors, and
assigns of each, releases and forever discharges WECU, WECU Affiliates, and
the successors and assigns of each, and the officers, directors, shareholders,
members, partners, employees and agents of each (as applicable, a " _Releasee_
") of and from any and all causes of action, claims, demands,
assessments, losses, liabilities, fines, penalties, suits, damages, liens,
rights, compensation, costs, and expenses of whatsoever kind or nature
including reasonable legal and expert fees and expenses (" _Damages_ "),
whether now known or unknown, and whether they exist now or in the future,
arising from or relating to performance of, error or delay in performance,
attempting to perform or failing to perform, any responsibilities hereunder,
or any Damages related thereto, including claims arising as a result of the
express negligence of the Releasee unless the Damages resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Releasee. 
---|---|--- 



     | _15._  |

_Indemnification._ As used in Sections 14, 15, and 16: (a) the term Affiliate
means any individual or corporation, limited liability company, partnership,
joint venture or other entity (" _Person_ "), that directly or indirectly
through one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by or is under
common control with the Person in question, with the term "control" meaning
the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the 

---|---|--- 
 



-4- through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and from and
after the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution
Agreement by and among The Williams Companies, Inc. and Williams Partners
L.P., and certain of their respective affiliates contemplated to be signed in
February 2014 (the "Contribution Agreement") (b) when used in reference to
Williams Development, the term Affiliate shall exclude WECU, including all of
the "Partnership Parties" and their respective "Affiliates" as defined in the
Contribution Agreement, and, when used with reference to WECU, shall exclude

respective "Affiliates" as defined in the Contribution Agreement; (c)
references to WECU and Williams Development , as applicable, as the
Indemnified Party, shall include their respective Affiliates, the successors

assigns, and, in the case of individuals, their estates, heirs, and personal
representatives; and (d) the Subject Employees are deemed to be third parties. 
---|--- 



     | _16._  | _Indemnification Obligations._ Williams Development ,
for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, and the predecessors in interest,
successors, and assigns of each (the "Williams Development  _Indemnifying
Party_ ") shall indemnify WECU for itself and on behalf of its Affiliates, and
the predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns of each (the " _WECU
Indemnified Party_ ") from and against all Damages sustained or incurred as a
result of or arising out of or by virtue of any claim made by a third party
against a WECU Indemnified Party, which claim arises out of or is caused by
(a) a breach of this Agreement by a Williams Development Indemnifying Party,
or (b) any action or omission, including negligence (but excluding gross
negligence or willful misconduct) of a WECU Indemnifying Party (as defined
below) in connection with WECU obligations hereunder. WECU, (the " _WECU
Indemnifying Party_ ") shall indemnify Williams Development (the "Williams
Development _Indemnified Party_ ") from and against all Damages sustained or
incurred as a result of or arising out of or by virtue of any claim made by a
third party against a Williams Development Indemnified Party, which claim
arises out of or is caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a
WECU Indemnifying Party. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | _17._  | _Procedure._ Each of WECU and Williams Development
shall give the other party prompt written notice and information in such
partys possession concerning any claim that could result in Damages.
In performing its indemnity obligation, the Williams Development Indemnifying
Party or the WECU Indemnifying Party (as applicable, the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") shall have the right to assume the settlement in the defense of any
suit or suits or other legal proceedings brought to enforce all such Damages
and shall pay all judgments entered in any such suit or other legal
proceedings. Except in the case where the Indemnifying Party refuses to assume
such defense in settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have no liability
for any settlement in or compromise made without its written consent. 
---|---|--- 



     | _18._  |

_Disclaimer; Limitation of Liability._ Neither party shall be responsible for
any incidental, indirect, consequential, special, punitive, aggravated, or
exemplary damages. Regardless of the basis on which Williams Development makes
a claim against WECU for damages, WECU shall not be liable for any amount in
excess of the lesser of (a) 

---|---|--- 
 



-5- or (b) the amount paid to WECU in excess of reimbursement for direct and
indirect costs in performance of the Services. All claims against WECU shall
be deemed waived unless made by Williams Development in writing and received
by WECU within six months after completion of the Services with respect to
which the claim is being made. 
---|--- 
 



     | _19._  | _Force Majeure._ A partys obligation under this
Agreement, other than an obligation to pay money and the indemnification
obligations hereunder, shall be excused when and to the extent its
performance of that obligation is prevented due to any cause beyond the
reasonable control of a party, including the following causes (unless they are
within such partys reasonable control): acts of God, strikes, lockouts, acts
of the public enemy, wars or warlike action (whether actual or impending),
arrests and other restraints of government (civil or military), blockades,
embargoes, insurrections, riots, epidemics, landslides, lightning,

hurricanes, floods, civil disturbances, terrorism, mechanical breakdown of
machinery or equipment, explosions, confiscation or seizure by any government
or other public authority and any order of any court of competent
jurisdiction, regulatory agency or governmental body having jurisdiction. The
party that is prevented from performing its obligation by reason of one or
more of the foregoing events (the " _Delayed Party_ ") shall promptly notify
the other party of that fact and shall exercise due diligence to end its
inability to perform as promptly as practicable. However, in no event shall a
Delayed Party be required to settle any strike, lockout, or other labor
dispute in which it may be involved, but in the event of a strike, lockout,
or other labor dispute affecting WECU, WECU shall use reasonable efforts to
continue to perform the Services by utilizing its management personnel and
that of its Affiliates. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | _20._  | _Assignment; Amendment._ Except as otherwise provided
herein, neither party shall sell, assign, or transfer any of its rights, or
delegate any of its obligations, under this Agreement to any Person
without the prior consent of the other party except that such prior consent
shall not be required if such sale, assignment, or transfer is to an Affiliate
of a party or in connection with a merger, consolidation, or the sale of
substantially all of its assets. This Agreement may be amended in a writing
signed by both parties hereunder.

      |  | 
---|---|--- 
     _Summary_ : |  | WECU and Suncor are parties to a long term
offgas processing agreement which provides for a profit sharing arrangement
under which a portion of the net value of the liquids produced from Suncors
offgas stream, if positive, is paid to Suncor. The Aggregate Netback Price
accrual account, which tracks associated revenues from product sales and costs
(including operational, capital, and return), is currently negative. 
   | 
   |  | Suncor and WECU do not agree on (a) the price to be applied to
propane (the postings used to determine the price are no longer in existence),
and (b) the ability of WECU to make corrections to the Aggregate Netback
Price accrual account that relate to historical calculation mistakes. The
agreement provides that all disputes are to be referred to binding
arbitration. Suncor initiated the arbitration on the propane price issue in
mid-February 2013, and WECU initiated the arbitration on the Aggregate
Netback Price corrections issue at the end of February 2013. 
   | 
   |  | The disputes have been consolidated and are being heard
together. 
      |  |

    _Status (01/22/14)_: |  | On January 20, 2014 initial pleadings
(Statements of Position) were filed by each party. Responses (Answering
Statement of Position) are due to be filed February 3, 2014.

Environmental Matters

Fort McMurray pipeline license amendment:

The operating license governing the pipelines at the WECU Fort McMurray
facilities which transport offgas from the compression and treatment
facilities on the Suncor upgrader site to the liquids extraction plant require
amendment due to H2S content.

 

When the pipelines were initially put into service, the H2S content specified
in the license was entered as 0.0 H2S. In a meeting with the regulator on
August 13, 2013, the regulator clarified that entering "0" H2S was common
practice for pipelines that have H2S content below the sour service threshold.
WECU notified the regulator that there is some H2S in these pipelines and
that WECU intends to amend the license in the near future. The Alberta Energy
Regulator has not required that the facility cease operations.

 

WECU has completed an engineering assessment, has gathered the data required
to amend the license and is currently looking at the impacts of the amendment
on emergency planning. WECU intends to submit an amendment application in the
first quarter of 2014. Disclosure Schedule 3.13
