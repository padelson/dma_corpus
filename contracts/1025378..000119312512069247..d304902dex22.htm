RECITALS 

A. Immediately prior to the execution and delivery hereof, W. P. Carey and
NewCo REIT have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of the

"Conversion Agreement"), which provides for the merger of W. P. Carey with and
into NewCo REIT, with NewCo REIT surviving the merger (such transactions are
collectively referred to herein as the "W. P. Carey Conversion"), upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein.

B. The Conversion Agreement contemplates that W. P. Carey shall, following the
Reorganization (as defined in Section 3.4), merge with and into NewCo REIT and
each outstanding listed share of W. P. Carey, no par value (the "Listed
Shares"), shall be cancelled and, in exchange for cancellation of such share,
the rights attaching to such share shall be converted into one (1) share of
NewCo REITs common stock, $0.001 par value per share ("NewCo REIT Common
Stock"), as set forth in the Conversion Agreement.

C. Prior to the consummation of the W. P. Carey Conversion, W. P. Carey and

Reorganization.

D. Prior to the Merger (as defined below), a newly-formed, wholly-owned

share, of CPA15 shall be converted into one share of common stock, $0.001 par
value per share, of CPA 15 Holdco (the term "CPA15 Common Stock" as used
herein shall refer to the common stock of CPA15 prior to such merger and the
common stock of CPA 15 Holdco from and after the effective time of such
merger).

E. After the completion of the W. P. Carey Conversion and the Reorganization,
W. P. Carey, CPA15 Holdco, NewCo REIT, W. P. Carey Holdco LLC and Merger Sub
intend, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, to merge CPA 15 Holdco with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger"),
with Merger Sub surviving the Merger as a direct subsidiary of W. P. Carey
Holdco LLC (a direct subsidiary of NewCo REIT) and CPA 15 being a direct
subsidiary of Merger Sub.

 

F. A special committee of independent directors of the Board of Directors of
CPA15 (the "CPA15 Special Committee") has unanimously (i) determined that
this Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Merger
Transaction Documents (as defined herein), including the Merger, are advisable
and in the best interests of CPA15 and the CPA15

the Reorganization, (B) the Conversion Agreement, and the transactions
contemplated thereby and by the Conversion Transaction Documents (as defined
herein), including the W. P. Carey Conversion and (C) this Agreement, and the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Merger Transaction Documents,
including the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of W. P. Carey
and the W. P. Carey Stockholders (as defined herein).

H. This Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Merger

directors and a majority of the directors who are not interested in the Merger

and by the Conversion Transaction Documents, including the W. P. Carey
Conversion, have been approved by (i) the Board of Directors of W. P. Carey
and (ii) the board of directors of NewCo REIT. 

I. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the CPA15 Merger
shall be characterized as a reorganization governed by Section 368(a)(1)(F)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the Merger

AGREEMENT

In consideration of the premises and the mutual representations, warranties,

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

Section 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 3-105 of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL"), CPA 15
Holdco shall merge with and into Merger Sub. Following the Merger, Merger Sub
will continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Company") and a
direct subsidiary of W. P. Carey Holdco LLC, a direct subsidiary of NewCo
REIT, and the separate corporate existence of CPA 15 Holdco will cease, each
in accordance with Section 3-114 of the MGCL, and, from and after the
Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), the Merger shall have the effects
set forth in the applicable provisions of the MGCL. NewCo REIT will maintain
its existence as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under Section 856(c)
of the Code.

 



\- 2 -  Section 1.2. Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger will take
place commencing at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the third Business Day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article V (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), at the offices of
DLA Piper LLP (US), 1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10020, or
at such other time and place as is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto
(the date on which the Closing takes place, the "Closing Date").

 

Section 1.3. Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, as part of the Closing, CPA15 and Merger Sub shall execute
articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B and shall file such Articles of Merger in
accordance with the MGCL with the State Department of Assessments and
Taxation of Maryland (the "SDAT") and shall make all other filings and
recordings required under the MGCL with respect to the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as NewCo REIT and CPA15 shall agree should
be specified in the Articles of Merger (such time as the Merger becomes
effective, the "Effective Time"); _provided that_ such time is not earlier
than the time the Articles of Merger are filed of record and does not exceed
30 days after the Articles of Merger are accepted for record. Unless
otherwise agreed, the parties shall cause the Effective Time to occur on the
Closing Date.

Section 1.4. Charter and Bylaws. The articles of incorporation of Merger Sub
(the "Merger Sub Charter") and the bylaws of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub
Bylaws") as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger,
shall, except for any required amendments, be the articles of incorporation
and the bylaws of the Surviving Company, until further amended in accordance
with the respective terms of such articles of incorporation and bylaws and
applicable Maryland Law.

Section 1.5. Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company. Unless
otherwise determined by NewCo REIT and CPA15, from and after the Effective
Time (i) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Company, and (ii) the officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of

Merger and without any further action on the part of W. P. Carey, CPA15, CPA
15 Holdco, Merger Sub, NewCo REIT, any other W. P. Carey Subsidiary or any
stockholder of CPA15 and CPA 15 Holdco (the stockholders of CPA15 and CPA 15
Holdco, the "CPA15 Stockholders"), each share of CPA15 Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and,
in exchange for cancellation of such share (other than the Dissenting Shares
discussed in Section 1.7), the rights attaching to such share shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (as
defined below). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each share of
CPA15 Common Stock that is owned by W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist without
any conversion thereof or payment therefor.

 



\- 3 -  (b) Subject to Section 1.7, at the Effective Time, all shares of CPA15 Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of CPA15 Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration or any cash pursuant to Section 1.9(e).

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings:

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent that the right to demand payment of fair value of the CPA15 Common
Stock in connection with the Merger is available under the MGCL, any
outstanding shares of CPA15 Common Stock held by a Dissenting Stockholder
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration but shall become the right to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Stockholder pursuant to the MGCL; _provided, however_ , that each share of
CPA15 Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a Dissenting Stockholder who, after the Effective Time, withdraws his
demand or fails to perfect or otherwise loses his right to receive payment of
fair value, pursuant to the MGCL, shall be deemed to be converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest. As used in this Agreement, "Dissenting Stockholder" means
any record holder or beneficial owner of shares of CPA15 Common Stock who is
entitled to demand and receive payment of the fair value of such holders
shares pursuant to Section 3-202 of the MGCL and who does not vote for the
Merger and complies with all provisions of the MGCL (including all provisions
of Section 3-203 of the MGCL) concerning the right of holders of shares of
CPA15 Common Stock to object to the Merger and obtain fair value for their
shares.

(b) CPA15 and CPA 15 Holdco shall give NewCo REIT (i) prompt notice of any
demands for payment of fair value pursuant to the applicable provisions of the
MGCL received by CPA15 or CPA 15 Holdco, attempted withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the MGCL and received
by CPA15 or CPA 15 Holdco relating to rights of appraisal and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in and direct the conduct of all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for payment of fair value under the MGCL.
CPA15 and CPA 15 Holdco shall not, except with the prior written consent of
NewCo REIT, make any payment with respect to any such demands for payment of
fair value, or settle, or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate any such
demands for payment of fair value.

 



\- 4 -  Section 1.8. Adjustments to Per Share Merger Consideration.

effect of any reclassification, combination, subdivision, stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any stock dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into CPA15 Common Stock or NewCo REIT
Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to CPA15 Common Stock (or for which a record date is
established) and with respect to the NewCo REIT Common Stock (or for which a
record date is established), after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time; _provided that_ nothing in this Section 1.8 shall be construed to

the Surviving Company of the shares of CPA15 Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

employee, officer, director, partner, agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall
be liable to any person for any part of the Per Share Merger Consideration or

official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any shares of CPA15 Common
Stock five years after the Effective Time or at such earlier date as is
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat

Common Stock shall be issued hereunder. To the extent that a holder of CPA15
Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of

receive a cash payment in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by
$10.48.

shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to CPA15 to act

and shall cause, the Surviving Company to provide to the Paying and Exchange
Agent immediately following the Effective Time the aggregate cash portion of
the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon cancellation of the CPA15
Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6. The funds deposited with the Paying and
Exchange Agent in respect of the Per Share Merger Consideration is hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund." As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, and in any event not later than the 10th Business Day thereafter,
the Paying and Exchange Agent shall pay to each holder of CPA15 Common Stock
the amount of cash such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
1.6(a).

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of CPA15 Common Stock one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to NewCo REIT or its designated Affiliate,
upon demand, and any holder of CPA15 Common Stock who has not theretofore
complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to NewCo REIT or its
successor in interest for payment of its claim for the Per Share Merger

$1,000,000,000. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be the property of, and paid to, NewCo REIT or its designated
Affiliate.

applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of CPA15 Common
Stock, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
such payments under the Code or any other provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. Any such amounts so deducted and withheld shall be paid over

withholding was made.

W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect.

(d) _SEC Documents_.

 

(i) W. P. Carey has made available to CPA15 (by public filing with the SEC or
otherwise) a true and complete copy of each report, schedule, registration
statement and definitive proxy statement filed by W. P. Carey or NewCo REIT
with the SEC since January 1, 2008 (the "W. P. Carey SEC Documents"), which
are all of the documents required to have been filed by NewCo REIT and W. P.
Carey with the SEC since that date. As of their respective dates, the W. P.
Carey SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder
applicable to such W. P. Carey SEC Documents and none of the W. P. Carey SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except to the extent such statements have been modified or
superseded by later W. P. Carey SEC Documents filed and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement. Neither NewCo REIT nor W. P. Carey has
any outstanding and unresolved comments from the SEC with respect to the W. P.
Carey SEC Documents. The consolidated financial statements of W. P. Carey and
W. P. Carey Subsidiaries, included in the W. P. Carey SEC Documents complied
as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting

thereto, or, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Rule
10-01 of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act) and fairly presented, in
accordance with applicable requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to
normal, recurring adjustments, none of which are material), the consolidated
financial position of W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as of their respective dates and the consolidated statements of income
and the consolidated cash flows of W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey
Subsidiaries for the periods presented therein, in each case, except to the

P. Carey SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement. No W. P. Carey Subsidiary is required to make any filing with the
SEC.

(ii) W. P. Carey maintains a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (A) transactions are executed
in accordance with managements general or specific authorizations, (B) access
to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization and (C) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences.

 



\- 13 -  (iii) W. P. Careys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules

that (A) all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by W. P. Carey in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (B) all such
information is accumulated and communicated to W. P. Careys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of W. P. Carey required under the Exchange Act with respect
to such reports.

 

(iv) Since December 31, 2010, W. P. Carey has not received any notification of
(A) a "significant deficiency" or (B) a "material weakness" in W. P. Careys
internal controls. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant
deficiency" and "material weakness" shall have the meanings assigned to them
in Release 2004-001 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement.

(e)  _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed or reflected
in the W. P. Carey SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date of this
Agreement or as disclosed in Schedule 2.2(e) of the W. P. Carey Disclosure
Letter, since December 31, 2010 there has not been: (i) (A) any declaration,

capital stock except for regular quarterly dividends on the Listed Shares;
(B) any amendment of any term of any outstanding equity security of W. P.
Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary; (C) any repurchase, redemption or other

(f) _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the W. P.
Carey SEC Documents, as set forth in Schedule 2.2(f) of the W. P. Carey
Disclosure Letter or as otherwise would not reasonably be expected to have a
W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect, there are no liabilities of W. P. Carey
or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary of a nature that would be required under GAAP
to be set forth on the financial statements of W. P. Carey or the notes
thereto, other than: (i) liabilities adequately provided for on the balance

W. P. Carey Subsidiary is in default or violation (and no event has occurred
which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
violation) of any term, condition or provision of (i) the W. P. Carey LLC
Agreement or the W. P. Carey Bylaws, the NewCo REIT Charter or the NewCo REIT

 



\- 14 -   Bylaws, or the Merger Sub Charter or the Merger Sub Bylaws, or any provision
of the comparable charter or organizational documents of any of such W. P.
Carey Subsidiaries, as applicable, (ii) any loan or credit agreement, note,
or any bond, mortgage or indenture, to which W. P. Carey, NewCo REIT, Merger
Sub or any of such W. P. Carey Subsidiaries is a party or by which W. P.
Carey, NewCo REIT, Merger Sub or any of such W. P. Carey Subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets is bound, or (iii) any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to W. P. Carey,
NewCo REIT, Merger Sub or any of such W. P. Carey Subsidiaries, except in the
case of (ii) and (iii) for defaults or violations which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(h) _Compliance with Applicable Laws; Regulatory Matters_. Except for
environmental matters, which are addressed in Section 2.2(n), W. P. Carey and
the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances,
exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for
the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the "W. P. Carey
Permits"), except where the failure so to hold such W. P. Carey Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect. W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the W. P. Carey Permits,
except where the failure to so comply, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect.
Except as disclosed in the W. P. Carey SEC Documents, the businesses of W. P.
Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of
any Law, except for violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to W. P. Carey
or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is pending or, to W. P. Careys Knowledge,
threatened, other than those the outcome of which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey
Material Adverse Effect. Neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is
subject to any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation
that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect. None of W. P. Carey, NewCo REIT or
Merger Sub is subject to any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of
any Governmental Entity that prohibits or would reasonably be expected to
prohibit any of the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Conversion
Agreement. None of W. P. Carey, NewCo REIT or Merger Sub has taken any action,
nor have any other steps been taken or have any legal proceedings
been commenced, nor to the Knowledge of W. P. Carey, threatened, against W.
P. Carey, NewCo REIT or Merger Sub, for the winding up, liquidation or
dissolution of W. P. Carey, NewCo REIT or Merger Sub.

 

(i) _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.2(i) of the W. P. Carey
Disclosure Letter or the W. P. Carey SEC Documents, there is no suit, action
or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of W. P. Carey, threatened against
or affecting W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary or any of their
respective properties or assets that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect, nor is
there any such suit, action or proceeding pending against W. P. Carey or any
W. P. Carey Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets which
in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent or enjoin, alter or materially
delay any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(j)  _Taxes._

(i) Each of W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, NewCo REIT and its Subsidiaries) has timely filed all
material Tax Returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any
valid extension to file). Each such Tax Return is true, correct and complete
in all material respects. W. P. Carey and each W. P. Carey

 



\- 15 -   Subsidiary has paid (or W. P. Carey has paid on its behalf), all material
Taxes required to be paid. All material Taxes which W. P. Carey or the W. P.
Carey Subsidiaries are required by Law to withhold or collect, including
Taxes required to have been withheld in connection with amounts paid or owing
to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third
party and sales, gross receipts and use Taxes, have been duly withheld or
collected and, to the extent required, have been paid over to the proper
Governmental Entities within the time period prescribed by Law. The most
recent audited financial statements contained in the W. P. Carey SEC Documents
filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement reflect an adequate
reserve in accordance with GAAP for all material Taxes payable by W. P. Carey
and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof
through the date of such financial statements. W. P. Carey and each W. P.
Carey Subsidiary has established (and until the Closing Date shall continue to
establish and maintain) on its books and records reserves that are adequate
for the payment of all material Taxes not yet due and payable. Since December
31, 2010, neither W. P. Carey nor any of the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries has
incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of
business and other than transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with
the sales of property. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance
exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentences will be imposed upon W. P. Carey or any W. P.
Carey Subsidiary. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.2(j) of the W. P. Carey
Disclosure Letter, neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is the
subject of any audit, examination, or other proceeding in respect of federal,
state, local or foreign Taxes; to the Knowledge of W. P. Carey, no audit,
examination or other proceeding in respect of federal, state, local or foreign
Taxes involving W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is being considered
by any Tax authority; and no audit, examination or proceeding in respect of
federal, state, local or foreign Taxes involving W. P. Carey or any W. P.
Carey Subsidiary has occurred since December 31, 2008. No deficiencies for any
Taxes have been asserted or assessed in writing (or to the Knowledge of W. P.
Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary, proposed) against W. P. Carey or any of
the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries, including claims by any taxing authority in a
jurisdiction where W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary does not file
Tax Returns but in which any of them is or may be subject to taxation, which
individually or in the aggregate would be material, and no requests for
waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes have been granted and remain in
effect or are pending. There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of W. P.
Carey or the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries except for statutory Liens for Taxes not
yet due or payable and for which appropriate reserves have been established on
their respective financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

(ii) NewCo REIT (A) intends to be subject to taxation as a REIT within the
meaning of the Code and to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT
beginning with its initial taxable year ending December 31, 2012, (B) has
operated, and intends to continue to operate, consistent with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT through the Effective
Time and (C) has not taken or omitted to take any action which could
reasonably be expected to result in the failure to qualify as a REIT. Each
Subsidiary of NewCo REIT which is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company has since its acquisition by NewCo REIT (A) been classified
for federal income Tax purposes as a partnership or treated as a disregarded
entity and not as an association taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly
traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code, and (B)
not owned any assets (including, without limitation, securities) that would
cause NewCo REIT to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. Each NewCo REIT
Subsidiary which is a corporation, and each other issuer of securities in
which NewCo REIT holds securities (within the meaning of Section 856(c) of the
Code but excluding "straight debt" of issuers as described in Section 856(m)
of the Code) having a value of more than 10

 



\- 16 -   percent of the total value, or more than 10 percent of the total voting
power, of the outstanding securities of such issuer, has since its acquisition
by NewCo REIT been a REIT, a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i)
of the Code or a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code.
Neither NewCo REIT nor any NewCo REIT Subsidiary holds any asset (x) the
disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the
Code as announced in IRS Notice 88-19 or Treasury Regulation Section
1.337(d)-5, Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-6 or Treasury Regulation
Section 1.337(d)-7 or (y) that is subject to a consent filed pursuant to
Section 341(f) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

subject, directly or indirectly, to any Tax Protection Agreement or (B) in
violation of or in default under any Tax Protection Agreement.

(v) Neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is a party to any Tax
allocation or sharing agreement or has changed any method of accounting for
Tax purposes.

(vi) W. P. Carey does not have any liability for the Taxes of any person other
than W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries and the W. P. Carey
Subsidiaries do not have any liability for the Taxes of any person other than
W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries (A) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law),
(B) as a transferee or successor, (C) by contract or (D) otherwise.(vii)
Neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey Subsidiary (x) has requested, received
or is subject to any written ruling of a Governmental Entity related to Taxes
or has entered into any written and legally binding agreement with a
Governmental Entity relating to Taxes, (y) has engaged in any transaction of
which it has made (or was required to make) disclosure to any Governmental
Entity to avoid the imposition of any penalties related to Taxes, or (z)
has participated in any transaction that could give rise to a disclosure
obligation as a "listed transaction" under Section 6011 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder or any similar provision under applicable
Law. 

(viii) Each of Carey REIT II, Inc., Carey REIT III, Inc., 308 Route 38, Inc.,
and Keystone Capital Company, Inc. (together the "REIT Subsidiaries") (A) for
each of its taxable year commencing with its organization has been subject to
taxation as a REIT within the meaning of the Code and has satisfied the
requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (B) has operated, and
intends to continue to operate, consistent with the requirements for
qualification and taxation as a REIT through the Effective Time and (C) has
not taken or omitted to take any action which could reasonably be expected to
result in the loss of its qualification as a REIT, and no challenge to such
REIT Subsidiarys qualification as a REIT is pending, or to such REIT
Subsidiarys Knowledge, threatened. Each Subsidiary of each REIT Subsidiary
that is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company that has not
elected to be an association taxable as a corporation has since its
acquisition by such REIT Subsidiary (A) been classified for federal income
Tax purposes as a partnership or treated as a disregarded entity and not as
an association taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded partnership"
within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code, and (B) not owned any
assets (including, without limitation, securities) that would cause the
relevant REIT Subsidiary to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. Each
Subsidiary of each REIT Subsidiary that is, or has elected to be taxable as,
a 

 



\- 17 -   corporation, and each other issuer of securities in which a REIT Subsidiary
holds securities (within the meaning of Section 856(c) of the Code but
excluding "straight debt" of issuers as described in Section 856(m) of the
Code) having a value of more than 10 percent of the total value, or more than
10 percent of the total voting power, of the outstanding securities of such
issuer, has since its acquisition by such REIT Subsidiary been a REIT, a
qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code or a taxable REIT
subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code. No REIT Subsidiary and no
Subsidiary of any REIT Subsidiary holds any asset (x) the disposition of
which would be subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code as
announced in IRS Notice 88-19 or Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-5,
Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-6 or Treasury Regulation Section
1.337(d)-7 or (y) that is subject to a consent filed pursuant to Section
341(f) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. As of the date of this
Agreement, no REIT Subsidiary has any earnings and profits attributable
to itself or any other corporation in any non REIT year within the meaning of
Section 857 of the Code.

(k) _Pension and Benefit Plans and Employee Relations_. Schedule 2.2(k) of
the W. P. Carey Disclosure Letter lists each written material "employee
pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") (referred to herein as
"Pension Plans") or "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA), other than as set forth in the W. P. Carey SEC Documents,
providing benefits to any current employee, officer or director of W. P.
Carey or any of the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries or any entity that is or required
under Section 414 of the Code to be treated with W. P. Carey as a single
employer (an "ERISA Affiliate") or with respect to which W. P. Carey or any
ERISA Affiliate could have any liability that would reasonably be expected to
have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect (collectively, the "Benefit
Plans"). Each Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code
and all other applicable laws. Each Pension Plan intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has been the subject of a determination
letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Pension Plan
is so qualified under all currently applicable provisions of Section 401(a) of
the Code and, to the knowledge of W. P. Carey, no circumstances exist that
would adversely affect the qualification of any such Pension Plan. No Benefit
Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA. Each Benefit Plan may be amended or
terminated in accordance with its terms. Schedule 2.2(k) of the W. P. Carey
Disclosure Letter lists each material employment, severance, consulting or
other contract or plan with or for the benefit of any officer, director or
employee of W. P. Carey or any of the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries containing a

additional benefits, vesting or acceleration of benefits or rights or
otherwise upon the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

industrial designs and copyrights necessary for the operation of the
businesses of each of W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "W. P. Carey Intangible Property", except where
the failure to possess or have adequate rights to use such properties,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect. All of the W. P. Carey Intangible
Property is owned or licensed by W. P. Carey or the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries
free and clear of any and all Liens, except those that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material

the Knowledge of W. P. Carey, the use of W. P. Carey Intangible Property by W.
P. Carey or the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries does not, in any material respect,
conflict with, infringe upon, violate or interfere with or constitute
an appropriation of any right, title, interest or goodwill, including,

patent, service mark, brand mark, brand name, computer program, database,
industrial design, copyright or any pending application therefor, of any
other Person, and there have been no claims made, and neither W. P. Carey nor

\- 31 -  Section 4.3. Fees Payable to CAM and its Affiliates. As a condition
and inducement to the willingness of NewCo REIT, W. P. Carey and Merger Sub

hereby, each of CPA15, CAM and Foreign Subsidiary agree that, concurrently
with and conditioned on the closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the amended and restated advisory agreement dated as of October 1,
2009, between CPA15 and CAM (the "CPA15 Advisory Agreement") and the Asset
Management Agreement, dated as of July 1, 2008, between CPA15 and Foreign
Subsidiary (the "Asset Management Agreement, " and together with the CPA15

waives its right to receive (i) a Termination Fee (as such term is defined in
the CPA15 Advisory Agreements) and (ii) a Subordinated Disposition Fee (as
such term is defined in the CPA15 Advisory Agreements). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein or in the CPA15 Advisory Agreements,
CPA15, CAM and Foreign Subsidiary each agrees that CAM and Foreign Subsidiary

(a) CPA15 shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed

practice (unless an alternative manner is required to avoid imposition of any
penalties, fines or additions to Tax) prior to the Closing Date
(after electing all available automatic extensions of time to file such Tax
Returns). Prior to filing any such Tax Returns, CPA15 shall deliver draft
copies (together with supporting documentation, including Tax Return work
papers) to W. P. Carey for W. P. Careys review and comment, and CPA15 shall
accept all reasonable comments of W. P. Carey with respect to such Tax

Effective Time. W. P. Carey shall have a reasonable period of time (but in no
event less than 30 days) to review and comment on such Tax Returns and
amendments prior to filing. If the parties do not agree on the draft Tax
Returns or amendments, the parties shall hire a nationally
recognized accounting firm reasonably acceptable to CPA15 and W. P. Carey to
prepare the contested Tax Returns or amendments.

(b) CPA15 will take all necessary actions, including but not limited to
making sufficient distributions prior to Closing if needed, to assure that

ending on the Closing Date. During the period from the date of this Agreement
to the Effective Time, CPA15 shall, and shall cause each CPA15 Subsidiary to,
facilitate all reasonable requests of NewCo REIT with respect to the
maintenance of CPA15s REIT qualification.

(c) Merger Sub, NewCo REIT and CPA15 shall report the Merger for U.S. federal

Affiliate of W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary to initiate, solicit,
encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing nonpublic information
or assistance) any inquiries or the making of any proposal or other action
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any W. P. Carey

to, take all actions reasonably necessary to cause their respective officers,
directors, investment advisors, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, brokers, finders and any other agents, representatives
or controlled Affiliates to, immediately cease any discussions,
negotiations or communications with any party or parties with respect to any
W. P. Carey Competing Transaction. W. P. Carey shall be responsible for (x)

confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of acquiring
(whether by merger, acquisition, stock sale, asset sale or otherwise) W. P.
Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary, if any, to return or destroy all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf
of W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary.

or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, investment
bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, brokers, finders or other
representatives or controlled Affiliates may receive after the date hereof
relating to any of the matters described in Section 4.5(a) or
otherwise relating to any request for information relating to W. P. Carey or
any of the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries (other than requests for information
unrelated to a W. P. Carey Competing Transaction). W. P. Carey shall keep
CPA15 reasonably informed on a prompt basis as to any material developments

exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 50% or more of
the assets of W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

fide financing transactions which do not,

 



\- 33 -   individually or in the aggregate, have as a purpose or effect the sale or
transfer of control of such assets; or (iii) any tender offer or exchange
offer for 50% or more of the voting power in the election of directors
exercisable by the holders of the outstanding Listed Shares (or any of the W.
P. Carey Subsidiaries), in each case excluding any transaction (x) that is
conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Conversion Agreement or (y) the consummation of which would
not reasonably be expected to materially impede, interfere with, prevent or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Conversion Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the transactions
contemplated by the Reorganization shall not constitute a W. P. Carey
Competing Transaction.

confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf
of CPA15 or any CPA15 Subsidiary. For purposes of this Section 4.6(a),

Subsidiaries is a party, in each case relating to a CPA15 Competing
Transaction. CPA15 shall promptly inform W. P. Carey in writing with respect
to any such inquiry or proposal that becomes reasonably likely to lead to a

party which the Board of Directors of CPA15 determines (after taking into
account any amendment of the terms of the W. P. Carey Conversion, the
Reorganization or the Merger by W. P. Carey and/or any proposal by W. P. Carey
to amend the terms of the Transaction Documents or W. P. Carey Conversion,
the Reorganization or the Merger), in good faith and after consultation with
its financial and legal advisors, (i) is on terms which are more favorable
from a financial point of view to the CPA15 Stockholders than the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) would result in
such third party owning, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of
the CPA15 Common Stock then outstanding (or all or substantially all of the
equity of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all of
the assets of CPA15 and the CPA15 Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iii) is
reasonably capable of being consummated and (iv) was not solicited by CPA15,
any CPA15 Subsidiary or any of their respective officers, directors,

consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Conversion Agreement

impracticable.

Section 4.8. Transfer and Gains Taxes. NewCo REIT or Merger Sub shall,
with CPA15s good faith cooperation and assistance, prepare, execute and
file, or cause to be prepared, executed and filed, all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property

Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar
Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (together, with any related interest, penalties or additions
to Tax, "Transfer and Gains Taxes"). From and after the Effective Time, NewCo
REIT or the Surviving Company shall pay or cause to be paid all Transfer and
Gains Taxes without deductions withheld from any amounts payable to the
holders of the CPA15 Common Stock.

 



\- 35 -  Section 4.9. Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance. 

It is understood and agreed that CPA15 shall indemnify and hold harmless, and,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and NewCo REIT shall
indemnify and hold harmless, each director and officer of CPA15 or any of the
CPA15 Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), as and to the same extent as
such Indemnified Parties are indemnified by CPA15 or the CPA15 Subsidiaries
as of the date hereof. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under this Section 4.9, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation, shall notify CPA15 and, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Company and NewCo REIT, promptly thereof; _provided that_
the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of CPA15, the
Surviving Company and NewCo REIT except to the extent such failure to
notify materially prejudices such party.

NewCo REIT agrees that it shall maintain in full force and effect for a period
of six years from the Effective Time all rights to indemnification existing
in favor of, and all limitations of the personal liability of, the directors
and officers of CPA15 and the CPA15 Subsidiaries provided for in the CPA15
Charter or CPA15 Bylaws or any provision of the comparable charter or
organizational documents of any of the CPA15 Subsidiaries, as in effect as of
the date hereof, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, including the Merger; _provided, however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claims (each a "Claim") asserted or made
within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Claim. Prior
to the Effective Time, W. P. Carey shall purchase directors and officers
liability insurance coverage for CPA15s and CPA15 Subsidiaries directors and
officers, in a form reasonably acceptable to CPA15, which shall provide such
directors and officers with runoff coverage for six years following the
Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other
terms not materially less favorable on the whole to the insured persons than,
the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained
by CPA15 and the CPA15 Subsidiaries.

This Section 4.9 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant
third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of NewCo REIT, CPA15 and the Surviving Company. Each of
the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained
in this Section 4.9. 

In the event that NewCo REIT or the Surviving Company or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of NewCo REIT and the Surviving Company, as the case may be, assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 4.9.

 

Section 4.10. Purchases and Redemptions of CPA15 Common Stock. During the
period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 or the Effective Time of the
Merger, CPA15 and CPA 15 Holdco each agrees that it will not purchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any CPA15 Common Stock or stock or other equity
interests in any CPA15 Subsidiary or any options, warrants or rights to
acquire, or security convertible into, shares of CPA15 Common Stock or stock
or other equity interests in any CPA15 Subsidiary, except that CPA15 may
complete any qualified redemptions pending as of the date of this Agreement
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



\- 36 -  Section 4.11. Purchases and Redemptions of Listed Shares or NewCo REIT Common
Stock. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 or the
Effective Time of the Merger, each of W. P. Carey and NewCo REIT agrees that
it will not, other than in the ordinary course of business or in connection
with the Reorganization, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Listed

continue to furnish non-public information and participate in negotiations
regarding such proposal; _provided, however_ , that not fewer than 72 hours
prior to any determination by CPA15s Board of Directors that the proposal for

unlikely to become, a CPA15 Superior Competing Transaction; and

 

(e) approve or recommend (and in connection therewith withdraw or modify its

_provided that_ such amount shall be paid promptly, but in no event later than
two Business Days after such termination. For purposes of this Agreement, the

expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, all attorneys,
accountants and investment bankers fees and expenses).

(c) W. P. Carey agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.1(i) then W. P. Carey will pay to CPA15, or as

liability or obligation on the part of NewCo REIT, W. P. Carey, Merger Sub,
CPA 15 Holdco or CPA15, other than Section 7.2, this Section 7.3, Section 7.6
and Article VIII and except to the extent that such termination results from a
willful breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement or a failure or refusal by such
party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby when such party was
obligated to do so in accordance with the terms hereof.

 

Section 7.4. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties in

inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (c) subject to the provisions of Section 7.4, waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of those rights. 

Section 7.6. Payment of Expenses.

(a) In the event that CPA15 or W. P. Carey becomes obligated to pay any
expenses under Section 7.2 (the "Expense Amount"), CPA15 or W. P. Carey, as
applicable, shall pay to the party entitled to receive such payment (the
"Receiving Party") from the amount deposited into escrow in accordance with
this Section 7.6(a), an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Expense Amount
and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Receiving
Party without causing the Receiving Party to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code for the year in which the Expense
Amount would otherwise be payable, for this purpose treating such amount as
income that does not qualify for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of
the Code, as determined by the Receiving Partys independent certified public
accountants, plus (B) if the Receiving Party receives either (1) a letter
from the Receiving Partys counsel indicating that the Receiving Party has
received a ruling from the IRS described in Section 7.6(b) or (2) an opinion
from the Receiving Partys counsel as described in Section 7.6(b), an amount
equal to the Expense Amount less the amount payable under clause (A) above. To
the extent the entire Expense Amount is not paid to the Receiving Party in the
year in which such amount would otherwise be payable as a result of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 7.6(a), the Expense Amount shall be
carried forward to the succeeding year and shall be payable (as described
above) in such succeeding year by applying the same formula and by deeming
such Expense Amount as payable in such succeeding year. To the extent the full
Expense Amount has not been paid in the initial and succeeding year, the
amount shall similarly be carried forward for each of the next three taxable
years. To the extent that the entire Expense Amount

 



\- 44 -   has not been paid in the initial year, the succeeding year and the three
following years, the Expense Amount shall be forfeited by the Receiving Party.
To secure the obligation of CPA15 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, to pay these
amounts, CPA15 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, shall deposit into escrow an
amount in cash equal to the Expense Amount with an escrow agent selected by
CPA15 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, and on such terms (subject to Section
7.6(b)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by CPA15 or W. P. Carey, as
applicable, the Receiving Party and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit
into escrow of the Expense Amount pursuant to this Section 7.6(a) shall be
made at the time CPA15 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, would otherwise be
obligated to pay the Receiving Party pursuant to Section 7.2.

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Expense Amount in escrow or
any portion thereof shall not be released to the Receiving Party unless the
escrow agent receives any of the following: (i) a letter from the Receiving
Partys independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount
that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Receiving Party without causing
the payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3)
of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
income that qualifies for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the
Code ("Qualifying Income") or a subsequent letter from the Receiving Partys
accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release
such amount to the Receiving Party, or (ii) a letter from the Receiving
Partys counsel indicating that the Receiving Party received a ruling from
the IRS holding that the receipt by the Receiving Party of the Expense Amount
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income for purposes of Code Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) (or alternatively, the
Receiving Partys counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the
receipt by the Receiving Party of the Expense Amount would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income for purposes of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3)of the Code), in which case the escrow agent
shall release the remainder of the Expense Amount to the Receiving Party.
CPA15 and W. P. Carey each agree to amend this Section 7.6 at the request of
the Receiving Party in order to (A) maximize the portion of the Expense
Amount that may be distributed to the Receiving Party hereunder without
causing the Receiving Party to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code, (B) improve the likelihood of the Receiving
Party securing a ruling described in this Section 7.6(b), or (C) assist the
Receiving Party in obtaining a legal opinion from its counsel as described in
this Section 7.6(b). The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion
of the Expense Amount not paid to the Receiving Party in the initial year and
