43        iii     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This Agreement
and Plan of Merger (this "AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of the 2nd
day of April, 2000, by and among Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("ANADARKO"), Dakota Merger Corp., a Utah corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko ("SUBCORP"), and Union Pacific Resources
Group Inc., a Utah corporation ("UPR").   PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS   A. The
Board of Directors of Anadarko has determined that the merger of Subcorp with
and into UPR, with UPR as the surviving corporation (the "MERGER"), pursuant
to which each share of UPR Common Stock (as defined in Section
4.4) outstanding at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) will be
converted into the right to receive Anadarko Common Shares (as defined in
Section 3.4(a)) as more fully provided herein, is consistent with and in
furtherance of the long-term business strategy of Anadarko and Anadarko
desires to combine its businesses with the businesses operated by UPR.   B.
The Board of Directors of UPR has determined that the Merger is consistent
with and in furtherance of the long-term business strategy of UPR and UPR
desires to combine its businesses with the businesses operated by
Anadarko and for the holders of shares of UPR Common Stock ("UPR
STOCKHOLDERS") to have a continuing equity interest in the combined
Anadarko/UPR businesses through the ownership of Anadarko Common Shares.  
C. The parties intend that the Merger constitute a tax-free "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "CODE").   D. The respective Boards of Directors of
Anadarko, Subcorp and UPR have determined the Merger in the manner
contemplated herein to be desirable and in the best interests of their
respective shareholders, and, by resolutions duly adopted, have approved and
adopted this Agreement.   AGREEMENT   Now, therefore, in consideration of
these premises and the mutual and dependent promises hereinafter set forth,
the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I.   THE MERGER   1.1 THE
MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and
in accordance with the provisions of the Utah Revised Business Corporation
Act (the "UBCA"), Subcorp shall be merged with and into UPR at the Effective
Time. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Subcorp
shall cease and UPR shall continue its existence under the laws of the State
of Utah. UPR, in its capacity as the corporation surviving the Merger, is
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "SURVIVING CORPORATION."   1.2
EFFECTIVE TIME. As promptly as possible on the Closing Date (as
defined below), the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated
by filing with the Division of Corporations and Commercial Code of the State
of Utah (the "UTAH DIVISION") articles of merger (the "ARTICLES OF MERGER")
in such form as is required by and executed in accordance with Section
16-10a-1105 of the UBCA. The Merger shall become effective (the "EFFECTIVE
TIME") when the Articles of Merger have been filed with the Utah Division or
at such later time as shall be agreed upon by Anadarko and UPR and specified
in the Articles of Merger. Prior to the filing referred to in this Section
1.2, a closing (the "CLOSING") shall be held at the principal business
offices of Anadarko, or such other place as the parties hereto may agree as
soon as practicable (but in any event within three business days) following
the date upon which all conditions set forth in Article VI have been
satisfied or waived, or at such other date as Anadarko and UPR may agree;
provided, that the conditions set forth in Article VI have been satisfied
or   1    waived at or prior to such date. The date on which the Closing
takes place is referred to herein as the "CLOSING DATE."   1.3 EFFECTS OF
THE MERGER. From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in Section 16-10a-1106 of the UBCA.   1.4 ARTICLES OF
INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS. The Articles of Merger shall provide that at the
Effective Time (i) the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended as of
the Effective Time so as to contain the provisions, and only the provisions,
contained immediately prior thereto in the Articles of Incorporation of
Subcorp, except for Article I thereof, which shall continue to read "The name
of the corporation is \'UNION PACIFIC RESOURCES GROUP INC.\' ", and (ii) the
By-laws of Subcorp in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation; in each case, until amended in
accordance with the UBCA.   1.5 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of UPR shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation and the directors of Subcorp shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified. On or prior to the
Closing Date, UPR shall deliver to Anadarko evidence satisfactory to Anadarko
of the resignations of the directors of UPR, such resignations to be
effective as of the Effective Time.   1.6 ADDITIONAL ACTIONS. If, at any
time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be
advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other
acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to
or under any of the rights, properties or assets of UPR, or (b) otherwise
carry out the provisions of this Agreement, UPR and its officers and
directors shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an
irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds,
assignments or assurances in law and to take all acts necessary, proper or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out
the provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of UPR or otherwise to take
any and all such action.   ARTICLE II.   CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   2.1
CONVERSION OF CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Anadarko, Subcorp or UPR or
their respective shareholders:   (a) Each share of common stock of Subcorp
("SUBCORP COMMON STOCK")  issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be  converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. Such  newly issued shares shall thereafter constitute
all of the issued and  outstanding capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each
share of  UPR Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective  Time shall be converted into and represent a number of Anadarko
Common  Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio.   (c) Each share of capital
stock of UPR held by UPR shall be cancelled  and retired and no payment shall
be made in respect thereof.   2.2 EXCHANGE RATIO; FRACTIONAL SHARES;
ADJUSTMENTS.   (a) The "EXCHANGE RATIO" shall be equal to 0.4550.   (b) No
certificates for fractional Anadarko Common Shares shall be  issued as a
result of the conversion provided for in Section 2.1(b) and  such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner   2     thereof to vote or
have any rights of an Anadarko Stockholder (as defined  in Section 3.3) or a
holder of Anadarko Common Shares.   (c) In lieu of any such fractional
Anadarko Common Shares, the holder  of a certificate previously evidencing
UPR Common Stock, upon presentation  of such fractional interest represented
by an appropriate certificate for  UPR Common Stock to the Exchange Agent (as
defined in Section 2.3(a))  pursuant to Section 2.3, shall be entitled to
receive a cash payment  therefor in an amount equal to the value (determined
with reference to the  closing price of Anadarko Common Shares as reported on
the New York Stock  Exchange ("NYSE") Composite Tape ("NYSE Composite Tape")
on the last full  trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date) of such
fractional  interest. Such payment with respect to fractional shares is
merely intended  to provide a mechanical rounding off of, and is not a
separately bargained  for, consideration. If more than one certificate
representing shares of UPR  Common Stock shall be surrendered for the account
of the same holder, the  number of Anadarko Common Shares for which
certificates have been  surrendered shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate number of  shares represented by the certificates so
surrendered.   (d) In the event that, prior to the Effective Time, Anadarko
shall  declare a stock dividend or other distribution payable in Anadarko
Common  Shares or securities convertible into Anadarko Common Shares, or
effect a  stock split, reclassification, combination or other change with
respect to  Anadarko Common Shares, the Exchange Ratio set forth in this
Section 2.2  shall be adjusted to reflect such dividend, distribution, stock
split,  reclassification, combination or other change.   2.3 EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES.   (a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Promptly following the Effective Time,
Anadarko  shall deposit with ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C. or such
other  exchange agent as may be designated by Anadarko (the "EXCHANGE
AGENT"), for  the benefit of UPR Stockholders, for exchange in accordance
with this  Section 2.3, certificates representing Anadarko Common Shares
issuable  pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of UPR
Common  Stock and shall from time-to-time deposit cash in an amount
reasonably  expected to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2 (such Anadarko Common
Shares  and cash, together with any dividends or distributions with respect 
thereto, the "EXCHANGE FUND").   (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As soon as
practicable after the Effective  Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of a  certificate or certificates (the "CERTIFICATES") that
immediately prior to  the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
UPR Common Stock whose  shares were converted into the right to receive
Anadarko Common Shares  pursuant to Section 2.1(b), (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall  specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the  Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the  Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such
other customary  provisions as Anadarko may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for  effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
certificates  representing Anadarko Common Shares. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for  cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a duly
executed letter of  transmittal, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in  exchange therefor (i) a certificate or certificates
representing that whole  number of Anadarko Common Shares which such holder
has the right to receive  pursuant to Section 2.1 in such denominations and
registered in such names  as such holder may request and (ii) a check
representing the amount of cash  in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and
unpaid dividends and  distributions, if any, which such holder has the right
to receive pursuant  to the provisions of this Article II, after giving
effect of any required  withholding tax. The shares represented by the
Certificate so surrendered  shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on the  cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid
dividends and  distributions, if any, payable to holders of shares of UPR
Common Stock. In  the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of UPR
Common Stock that is  not registered on the transfer records of UPR, a
certificate representing  the proper number of Anadarko Common Shares,
together with a check for the  cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares,
if any, and unpaid   3     dividends and distributions, if any, may be
issued to such transferee if  the Certificate representing such shares of UPR
Common Stock held by such  transferee is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents  required to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any  applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as  contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate
shall be deemed at any  time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon  surrender a certificate representing Anadarko Common
Shares and cash in  lieu of fractional shares, if any, and unpaid dividends
and distributions,  if any, as provided in this Article II. If any
Certificate shall have been  lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by  the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and,  if required by Anadarko, the posting by such person
of a bond in such  reasonable amount as Anadarko may direct as indemnity
against any claim  that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange  Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed  Certificate, a certificate representing the proper
number of Anadarko  Common Shares, together with a check for the cash to be
paid in lieu of  fractional shares, if any, with respect to the shares of UPR
Common Stock  formerly represented thereby, and unpaid dividends and
distributions on  Anadarko Common Shares, if any, as provided in this Article
II.   (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES.
Notwithstanding  any other provisions of this Agreement, no dividends or
other distributions  declared or made after the Effective Time with respect
to Anadarko Common  Shares having a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the  holder of any unsurrendered Certificate, and no cash
payment in lieu of  fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder, until
the holder shall  surrender such Certificate as provided in this Section 2.3.
Subject to the  effect of Applicable Laws (as defined in Section 3.11),
following surrender  of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
holder of the  certificates representing whole Anadarko Common Shares issued
in exchange  therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender,
the amount  of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective  Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole Anadarko
Common Shares  and not paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes that
may be required  thereon, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date subsequent
to surrender,  the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the  Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to  surrender payable with respect to such whole Anadarko Common
Shares, less  the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required
thereon.   (d) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN UPR COMMON STOCK. All
Anadarko  Common Shares issued upon surrender of Certificates in accordance
with the  terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to this Article II)
shall be  deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to  such shares of UPR Common Stock represented thereby, and, as
of the  Effective Time, the stock transfer books of UPR shall be closed and
there  shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books  of UPR of shares of UPR Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the  Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to  the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and 
exchanged as provided in this Section 2.3. Certificates surrendered for 
exchange by any person constituting an "affiliate" of UPR for purposes of 
Rule 145(c) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the 
rules and regulations thereunder, the "Securities Act"), shall not be 
exchanged until Anadarko has received written undertakings from such person 
in the form attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement.   (e) TERMINATION OF
EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund  that remains undistributed
to UPR Stockholders six months after the date of  the mailing required by
Section 2.3(b) shall be delivered to Anadarko, upon  demand thereby, and
holders of Certificates previously representing shares  of UPR Common Stock
who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.3  shall thereafter
look only to Anadarko for payment of any claim to Anadarko  Common Shares,
cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof, or dividends or  distributions, if
any, in respect thereof.   (f) NO LIABILITY. None of Anadarko, the Surviving
Corporation or the  Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect
of any shares of  UPR Common Stock (or dividends or distributions  
4     with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public  official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar  law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to
seven  years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date  on which any cash, any cash in lieu of fractional shares or any
dividends  or distributions with respect to whole shares of UPR Common Stock
in  respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the 
property of any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 3.4(d)), any 
such cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, 
to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, become the property of  Anadarko,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously  entitled
thereto.   (g) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any  cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Anadarko, on a
daily  basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall  be paid to Anadarko upon termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant
to  Section 2.3(e).   (h) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Surviving
Corporation and Anadarko  shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise  payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of UPR Common  Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to  the making of such payment under the Code and the
rules and regulations  promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax  law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving  Corporation or Anadarko, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be  treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the  holder of the shares of UPR Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction  and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Anadarko,
as the  case may be.   2.4 TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTIONS.   (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, Anadarko and UPR shall take all such  actions as may be
necessary to cause each unexpired and unexercised  outstanding option granted
or issued under stock option plans of UPR in  effect on the date hereof
(each, a "UPR OPTION") to be automatically  converted at the Effective Time
into an option (a "ANADARKO EXCHANGE  OPTION") to purchase that number of
Anadarko Common Shares equal to the  number of shares of UPR Common Stock
subject to the UPR Option immediately  prior to the Effective Time (without
regard to any actual restrictions on  exerciseability) multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio (and rounded to the  nearest share), with an exercise price
per share equal to the exercise  price per share that existed under the
corresponding UPR Option divided by  the Exchange Ratio (and rounded to the
nearest cent), and with other terms  and conditions that are the same as the
terms and conditions of such UPR  Option immediately before the Effective
Time PROVIDED, that Anadarko shall  equitably adjust the applicable
performance target under any UPR Option  that contains performance targets;
PROVIDED FURTHER that, with respect to  any UPR Option that is an "incentive
stock option" within the meaning of  Section 422 of the Code, the foregoing
conversion shall be carried out in a  manner satisfying the requirements of
Section 424(a) of the Code.   (b) In connection with the issuance of
Anadarko Exchange Options,  Anadarko shall (i) reserve for issuance the
number of Anadarko Common  Shares that will become subject to Anadarko
Exchange Options pursuant to  this Section 2.4 and (ii) from and after the
Effective Time, upon exercise  of Anadarko Exchange Options, make available
for issuance all Anadarko  Common Shares covered thereby, subject to the
terms and conditions  applicable thereto.   (c) Anadarko agrees to use its
reasonable efforts to file with the  Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"COMMISSION") within 30 days after  the Closing Date a registration statement
on Form S-8 or other appropriate  form under the Securities Act to register
Anadarko Common Shares issuable  upon exercise of the Anadarko Exchange
Options and to use its reasonable  efforts to cause such registration
statement to remain effective until the  exercise or expiration of such
options and rights. Prior to the Effective  Time, the Board of Directors of
Anadarko, or an appropriate committee   5     of non-employee directors
thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with  the interpretive guidance
of the Commission so that the acquisition by any  officer or director of
Anadarko who may become a covered person of UPR for  purposes of Section 16
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended  (together with the rules
and regulations thereunder, the "EXCHANGE ACT")  and the rules and
regulations thereunder ("SECTION 16") of Anadarko Common  Shares or options
to acquire Anadarko Common Shares pursuant to this  Agreement and the Merger
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of  Section 16.   ARTICLE
III.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANADARKO AND SUBCORP   In order
to induce UPR to enter into this Agreement, Anadarko and Subcorp hereby
represent and warrant to UPR that the statements contained in this Article
III are true, correct and complete.   3.1 ORGANIZATION AND STANDING. Each of
Anadarko and Subcorp is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation with full
corporate power and authority to own, lease, use and operate its properties
and to conduct its business as and where now owned, leased, used, operated
and conducted. Each of Anadarko and Subcorp, and each subsidiary of Anadarko,
is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the property it owns,
leases or operates, requires it to so qualify, except where the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing in such jurisdiction would not have a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.3) on Anadarko or Subcorp,
as the case may be. Anadarko is not in default in the performance, observance
or fulfillment of any provision of the Anadarko Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended (the "ANADARKO CERTIFICATE"), or the Anadarko By-
Laws, as amended (the "ANADARKO BY-LAWS"), and Subcorp is not in default in
the performance, observance or fulfillment of any provisions of its Articles
of Incorporation or By-laws. Anadarko has heretofore furnished to UPR a
complete and correct copy of (i) the Anadarko Certificate and the
Anadarko By-Laws, each as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and
(ii) the Articles of Incorporation of Subcorp and the By-laws of Subcorp.  
3.2 SUBSIDIARIES AND INVESTMENTS. Anadarko does not own, directly
or indirectly, any equity or other ownership interest in any

"ANADARKO SEC DOCUMENTS"). The Anadarko SEC Documents, including, without
limitation, any financial statements or schedules included therein, at the
time filed (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements,
on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively and, in
the case of any Anadarko SEC Document amended or superseded by a filing prior

and the Securities Act, as the case may be. The financial statements of

Anadarko and its subsidiaries files Tax Returns that Anadarko or any of its 
subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither

for the account of any other person, (ii) affords any  other person the
benefit of any net operating loss, net capital loss,  investment Tax credit,

state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee, by contract,  or
otherwise.   (e) Neither Anadarko nor any of its subsidiaries has

regulations, policies or guidelines promulgated, or judgments, decisions or
orders entered by any Governmental Authority (collectively, "APPLICABLE
LAWS") relating to Anadarko or its business or properties, except where the
failure to be in compliance with such Applicable Laws, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Anadarko. Except as set forth in Section 3.11 to the Anadarko Disclosure
Schedule, to the knowledge of Anadarko, no investigation or review by any
Governmental Authority with respect to Anadarko or its subsidiaries
is pending or threatened, nor has any Governmental Authority indicated in
writing an intention to conduct the same, other than those the outcome of
which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Anadarko.   3.12 REGISTRATION STATEMENT; JOINT PROXY STATEMENT. None of the

form in all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and

302 of ERISA, whether or not waived; (ii) no  reportable event within the

contemplated by this agreement will not  result in the occurrence of any such
reportable event; (iii) all premiums  to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (the "PBGC") have been timely  paid in full; (iv) no liability
(other than for premiums to the PBGC) under  Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by Anadarko or any  of its subsidiaries; and (v) the
PBGC has not instituted proceedings to  terminate any such Anadarko Plan and,
to Anadarko\'s knowledge, no condition  exists that presents a risk that such
proceedings will be instituted or  which would constitute grounds under
Section 4042 of ERISA for the  termination of, or the appointment of a
trustee to administer, any such  Anadarko Plan.   (g) (i) No Anadarko
Employee Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a  plan that has two or more
contributing sponsors at least two of whom are  not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a  "MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLAN");
(ii) none of Anadarko and its subsidiaries nor  any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last  six years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any  Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
Plan; and (iii) none of Anadarko  and its subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has  incurred any material Withdrawal Liability
that has not been satisfied in  full. With respect to each Anadarko Plan that
is a Multiemployer Plan: (i)  if Anadarko or any of its subsidiaries or any
of their respective ERISA  Affiliates were to experience a withdrawal or
partial withdrawal from such  plan, no material Withdrawal Liability would be
incurred; and (ii) none of  Anadarko and its subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates  has received any notification, nor does Anadarko
have any knowledge, that  any such Anadarko Plan is in reorganization, has
been terminated, is  insolvent, or may reasonably be expected to be in
reorganization, to be  insolvent, or to be terminated.   (h) There does not
now exist, nor, to the knowledge of Anadarko, do  any circumstances exist
that could reasonably be expected to result in, any  material Anadarko
Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of  Anadarko or any of
its subsidiaries following the Closing. Without limiting  the generality of
the foregoing, neither Anadarko nor any of its  subsidiaries, nor any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in  any transaction described
in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.   (i) Section 3.14(i) to
the Anadarko Disclosure Schedule sets forth a  list of each Anadarko
Employment Agreement under which the execution and  delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby could
(either alone or in conjunction with any other  event) result in, cause the
accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or  materially increase the
amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any  employee, officer or
director of Anadarko or any of its subsidiaries, or  could limit the right of
Anadarko or any of its subsidiaries to amend,  merge, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Anadarko  Employee Benefit Plan or related trust
or any Anadarko Material Employment  Agreement or related trust.   (j) None
of Anadarko and its subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of  Anadarko, any
other person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any  "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section  406 of
ERISA), which could subject any of the Anadarko Employee Benefit  Plans or
their related trusts, Anadarko, any of its subsidiaries or any  person that
Anadarko or any of its subsidiaries has an obligation to  indemnify, to any
material tax or material penalty imposed under Section  4975 of the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA.   (k) Except as set forth in Section 3.14(k) to the
Anadarko Disclosure  Schedule, there are no pending or threatened claims
(other than claims for  benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations which have been  asserted or instituted, and to Anadarko\'s
knowledge, no set of  circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to
a claim or lawsuit,  against the Anadarko   13     Plans, any
fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Anadarko  Plans or
the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Anadarko Plans  which could
reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of  Anadarko or
any of its subsidiaries to the PBGC, the Department of  Treasury, the
Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Anadarko  Plan or any
participant in an Anadarko Plan.   (l) Anadarko, its subsidiaries and each
member of their respective  business enterprises have in all material
respects complied with the Worker  Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
and in all material respects,  with all similar state, local and foreign
laws.   (m) All Anadarko Employee Benefit Plans subject to the laws of any 
jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) have been maintained in 
accordance with all applicable requirements, (ii) if they are intended to 
qualify for special tax treatment, meet all requirements for such  treatment,
and (iii) if they are intended to be funded and/or book-reserved  are funded
and/or book-reserved in all material respects, as appropriate,  based upon
reasonable actuarial assumptions.   3.15 CONTRACTS. All written or oral
contracts, agreements, guarantees, leases and executory commitments other
than Anadarko Plans to which Anadarko or its subsidiaries is a party or by
which its assets are bound which are material to Anadarko (each an "ANADARKO
CONTRACT"), are valid and binding obligations of Anadarko and, to the
knowledge of Anadarko, the valid and binding obligation of each other party
thereto except such Anadarko Contracts that if not so valid and binding would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Anadarko. Neither Anadarko nor, to the knowledge of Anadarko, any other party
thereto is in violation of or in default in respect of, nor has there
occurred an event or condition that with the passage of time or giving
of notice (or both) would constitute a default under or permit the
termination of, any such Anadarko Contract except such violations or defaults
under or terminations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have
a Material Adverse Effect on Anadarko.   3.16 LABOR MATTERS. Anadarko does
not have any labor contracts or collective bargaining agreements with any
persons employed by Anadarko or any persons otherwise performing services
primarily for Anadarko. There is no labor strike, dispute or stoppage pending
or, to the knowledge of Anadarko, threatened against Anadarko, and Anadarko
has not experienced any labor strike, dispute or stoppage or other material
labor difficulty involving its employees since January 1, 1998. To the
knowledge of Anadarko, since January 1, 1998, no campaign or other attempt
for recognition has been made by any labor organization or employees with
respect to employees of Anadarko or any of its subsidiaries.   3.17
UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except (i) as and to the extent disclosed
or reserved against on the balance sheet of Anadarko as of December 31,
1999 included in the Anadarko SEC Documents, or (ii) as incurred after the
date thereof in the ordinary course of business consistent with prior
practice and not prohibited by this Agreement, Anadarko does not have any
liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether absolute, accrued,
contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due, that, individually
or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Anadarko.   3.18 PERMITS; COMPLIANCE. Anadarko

to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (collectively, the
"ANADARKO PERMITS"), and there is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of
Anadarko, threatened regarding any of the Anadarko Permits. Anadarko is not
in conflict with, or in default or violation of any of the Anadarko Permits,
except for any such conflicts, defaults or violations which, individually or
in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Anadarko.   3.19 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as disclosed in the
Anadarko SEC Documents, (i) the properties, operations and activities of
Anadarko and its subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws (as defined below) and all past noncompliance of Anadarko

exposure of any person or property to any hazardous substance, pollutant or
contaminant in connection with the properties, operations and activities of
Anadarko and its subsidiaries, in each case, other than those matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Anadarko. The term "ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS" means all
federal, state, local or foreign laws relating to pollution, or protection of

to emissions, discharges, releases or threatened releases of chemicals,
pollutants, contaminants, or industrial, toxic or hazardous substances or
wastes (collectively, "HAZARDOUS MATERIALS") into the environment, or
otherwise relating to the manufacture, processing, distribution, use,

to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Exchange Ratio is
fair to Anadarko from a financial point of view. Anadarko has heretofore
provided copies of such opinion to UPR and such opinion has not been
withdrawn or revoked or modified in any material respect.   3.21 BOARD
RECOMMENDATION; REQUIRED VOTE. The Board of Directors of Anadarko, at a
meeting duly called and held, has by unanimous vote of those directors
present (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, and the Anadarko Stock Option Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, taken together, are fair to and in the
best interests of Anadarko and the Anadarko Stockholders, and (ii) resolved
to recommend that the Anadarko Stockholders approve and authorize the Share
Issuance and the Anadarko Board Amendment (as defined in Section 5.2(h)) (the
"ANADARKO BOARD RECOMMENDATION"). The affirmative vote of holders of
a majority of the Anadarko Common Shares present and voting at the
Anadarko Stockholders Meeting to approve the Share Issuance and the
affirmative vote of holders of 80% of the outstanding Anadarko Common Shares
to approve the Anadarko Board Amendment are the only votes of the Anadarko
Stockholders necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the transactions
contemplated hereby.   3.22 STATE TAKEOVER LAWS; RIGHTS AGREEMENT. Prior to
the execution of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Anadarko has taken
all action necessary to exempt under or make not subject to any state
takeover law or state law that purports to limit or restrict business
combinations or the ability to acquire or vote shares: (i) the execution of
this Agreement, and the Anadarko Stock Option Agreement, (ii) the Merger and
(iii) the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Anadarko Stock Option
Agreement. The Anadarko Rights Agreement has been amended so that UPR is
exempt from the definition of "ACQUIRING PERSON" contained in the Anadarko
Rights Agreement and no "SHARES ACQUISITION DATE" or "DISTRIBUTION DATE" (as
such terms are defined in the Anadarko Rights Agreement) will occur as a
result of the execution of the Anadarko Stock Option Agreement or the
acquisition or transfer of Anadarko Common Shares by UPR pursuant to
the Anadarko Stock Option Agreement. Copies of all such amendments to the
Anadarko Rights Agreement have been previously provided to UPR.  
15     ARTICLE IV.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF UPR   In order
to induce Subcorp and Anadarko to enter into this Agreement, UPR hereby
represents and warrants to Anadarko and Subcorp that the statements contained
in this Article IV are true, correct and complete, subject to, in each of the
following representations to the specified section of the disclosure schedule
delivered by UPR to Anadarko and dated the date hereof (the "UPR DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE") PROVIDED that items listed in any Section to the UPR Disclosure
Schedule shall apply only to the corresponding section of this Agreement
(except to the extent that there is a specific cross-reference to another
section of the UPR Disclosure Schedule).   4.1 ORGANIZATION AND STANDING.
UPR is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Utah with full corporate power and authority
to own, lease, use and operate its properties and to conduct its business as
and where now owned, leased, used, operated and conducted. Each of UPR and
each subsidiary of UPR is duly qualified to do business and in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or
the property it owns, leases or operates requires it to so qualify, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing in such jurisdiction
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on UPR. UPR is not in default in the
performance, observance or fulfillment of any provision of its Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "UPR ARTICLES"), or its By-laws, as
in effect on the date hereof (the "UPR BYLAWS"). UPR has heretofore furnished
to Anadarko a complete and correct copy of the UPR Articles and the UPR
Bylaws.   4.2 SUBSIDIARIES AND INVESTMENTS. UPR does not own, directly or
indirectly, any equity or other ownership interest in any corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other entity or enterprise, except for its
subsidiaries and other entities, in each case set forth in Section 4.2 to the
UPR Disclosure Schedule. Section 4.2 of the UPR Disclosure Schedule
specifically identifies each of UPR\'s "significant subsidiaries" as defined
in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X (the subsidiaries so identified the
"SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES"). UPR owns, directly or indirectly, each of the
outstanding shares of capital stock (or other ownership interests having by
their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of directors or others
performing similar functions with respect to such subsidiary) of each of
UPR\'s Significant Subsidiaries. Each of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of each of UPR\'s Significant Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and is owned, directly or indirectly,
by UPR free and clear of all liens, pledges, security interests, claims or
other encumbrances. With respect to UPR\'s subsidiaries other than the
Significant Subsidiaries, to the extent the outstanding shares of capital
stock of each of such Subsidiaries are not (i) duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, or (ii) owned, directly or
indirectly, by UPR free and clear of all liens, pledges, security interests,
claims or other encumbrances, there is not, and there could not reasonably be
expected to be, any material impact on the business and operations of UPR and
its subsidiaries taken as a whole. There are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, puts, calls, agreements, understandings, claims or other
commitments or rights of any type relating to the issuance, sale or transfer
of any securities of any subsidiary of UPR, nor are there outstanding any
securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of
capital stock of any subsidiary of UPR, and neither UPR nor any subsidiary of
UPR has any obligation of any kind to issue any additional securities or to
pay for or repurchase any securities of any subsidiary of UPR or any
predecessor thereof.   4.3 CORPORATE POWER AND AUTHORITY. UPR has all
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to authorization
of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby by UPR Stockholders,
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby by UPR have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of UPR, subject to authorization of the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby by UPR Stockholders. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by UPR and constitutes the legal, valid
and binding obligation of UPR enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms.   16     4.4 CAPITALIZATION OF UPR. As of March 31, 2000, UPR\'s
authorized capital stock consisted solely of (a) 400,000,000 shares of common
stock ("UPR COMMON STOCK"), of which (i) 251,952,336 shares were issued and
outstanding, (ii) 4,277,293 shares were issued and held by UPR (which does
not include shares of UPR Common Stock reserved for issuance set forth in
clause (iii) below), (iii) 11,194,329 shares were reserved for issuance upon
the exercise of outstanding UPR Options, and (iv) 50,138,515 shares of UPR
Common Stock were reserved for future issuance under the Stock Option
Agreement dated April 2, 2000 between Anadarko and UPR (the "UPR STOCK OPTION
AGREEMENT"); and (b) 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which (i) none
was issued and outstanding, and (ii) 3,000,000 shares have been designated as
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock reserved for issuance pursuant
to the rights issued under the UPR Rights Agreement (as defined in Section
4.22). Since March 31, 2000, UPR has not issued any additional shares of
capital stock except for the issuance of UPR Common Stock in connection with
the exercise of UPR Options and the issuance of UPR Common Stock in respect
of awards outstanding on the date of this Agreement under the Executive
Deferred Compensation Plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan for the Board
of Directors. Each outstanding share of UPR capital stock is duly authorized
and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and has not been issued in
violation of any preemptive or similar rights. Other than as set forth in the
first sentence hereof or as contemplated by the UPR Stock Option Agreement,
there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls,
agreements, understandings, claims or other commitments or rights of any type
relating to the issuance, sale, repurchase or transfer of any securities
of UPR, nor are there outstanding any securities which are convertible into
or exchangeable for any shares of capital stock of UPR, and neither UPR nor
any subsidiary of UPR has any obligation of any kind to issue any
additional securities or to pay for or repurchase any securities of UPR or
any predecessor. The issuance and sale of all of the shares of capital stock
described in this Section 4.4 have been in compliance with federal and state
securities laws and the UPR Common Stock is registered under the Exchange
Act. UPR has previously provided Anadarko with a schedule setting forth the
number of shares of each class (including the number of shares issuable upon
exercise of UPR Options and the exercise price and the grant date with
respect thereto) held by all holders of options to purchase UPR capital
stock. Other than pursuant to the UPR Stock Option Agreement, UPR has not
agreed to register any securities under the Securities Act or under any state
securities law or granted registration rights to any person or entity; copies
of all such agreements have previously been provided to Anadarko.   4.5
CONFLICTS; CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the UPR Stock Option Agreement by UPR, nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will:   (a) conflict with,
or result in a breach of any provision of, the UPR  Articles or the UPR
Bylaws;   (b) violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any
provision  of, or constitute a default (or an event that, with the giving of
notice,  the passage of time or otherwise, would constitute a default) under,
or  entitle any party (with the giving of notice, the passage of time or 
otherwise) to terminate, accelerate, modify or call a default under, or 
result in the creation of any lien, security interest, charge or  encumbrance
upon any of the properties or assets of UPR or any of its  subsidiaries
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,  bond,
mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, contract, undertaking, 
agreement, lease or other instrument or obligation to which UPR or any of 
its subsidiaries is a party;   (c) violate any order, writ, injunction,
decree, statute, rule or  regulation applicable to UPR or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their  respective properties or assets; or   (d)
require any action or consent or approval of, or review by, or  registration
or filing by UPR or any of its affiliates with, any third  party or any
Governmental Authority, other than (i) authorization of the  Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby by UPR Stockholders, (ii)  actions required
by the HSR Act, (iii) registrations or other actions  required under federal
and state securities laws as are contemplated by  this Agreement and (iv)
consents or approvals of any Governmental  Authority;   17    except in
the case of clauses (b), (c) and (d) for any of the foregoing that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on UPR or a
material adverse effect on the ability of the parties hereto to consummate
the transaction contemplated hereby.   4.6 BROKERAGE AND FINDER\'S FEES.
Except for UPR\'s obligations to Goldman, Sachs and Co. and Simmons and Company
(the "UPR FINANCIAL ADVISORS") (copies of all agreements relating to such
obligations having previously been provided to Anadarko), neither UPR nor any
stockholder, director, officer or employee thereof, has incurred or will
incur on behalf of UPR, any financial advisory, brokerage, finder\'s or
similar fee in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   4.7 REORGANIZATION. To the knowledge of UPR, neither UPR nor
any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that (without
giving effect to any actions taken or agreed to be taken by Anadarko or any
of its affiliates) would prevent the Merger from constituting a
"reorganization" qualifying under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
Code.   4.8 NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. As disclosed in the UPR SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since January 1, 2000,
there has been no material adverse change in the business, assets,
liabilities, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of UPR
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or any event, occurrence or
development that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on UPR or a material adverse effect on the ability of UPR to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.   4.9 UPR SEC DOCUMENTS.
UPR has timely filed with the Commission all forms, reports, schedules,
statements and other documents required to be filed by it since January 1,
1997 under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (such documents, as
supplemented and amended since the time of filing, collectively, the "UPR SEC
DOCUMENTS"). The UPR SEC Documents, including, without limitation, any
financial statements or schedules included therein, at the time filed
(and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the
dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing, respectively and, in the
case of any UPR SEC Document amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such amending or superseding
filing) (a) did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, and (b) complied in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act,
as the case may be. The financial statements of UPR included in the UPR SEC
Documents at the time filed (and, in the case of registration statements and
proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of mailing,
respectively, and, in the case of any UPR SEC Document amended or superseded
by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such
amending or superseding filing) complied as to form in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the Commission with respect thereto, were prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the Commission), and fairly present (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments)
the consolidated financial position of UPR and its consolidated subsidiaries
as at the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended. No subsidiary of UPR is subject to
the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or required to file
any form, report or other document with the Commission, the NYSE, any other
stock exchange or any other comparable Governmental Authority.   4.10
TAXES.   (a) UPR and its subsidiaries have duly filed all material
federal,  state, local and foreign income, franchise, excise, real and
personal  property and other Tax Returns (including, but not limited to,
those filed  on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis) required to have
been filed  by UPR or its subsidiaries prior to the date hereof. All of the
foregoing  Tax Returns and reports are true and correct (except for such
inaccuracies  that are, individually or in the aggregate, immaterial), and
UPR and its  subsidiaries have within the time and manner prescribed by
Applicable Law  paid or, prior to the   18     Effective Time, will pay
all Taxes, interest and penalties required to be  paid in respect of the
periods covered by such returns or reports or  otherwise due to any federal,
state, foreign, local or other taxing  authority. Neither UPR nor any of its
subsidiaries have any material  liability for any Taxes in excess of the
amounts so paid or reserves so  established and neither UPR nor any of its
subsidiaries is delinquent in  the payment of any material Tax. Neither UPR
nor any of its subsidiaries  has requested or filed any document having the
effect of causing any  extension of time within which to file any returns in
respect of any fiscal  year which have not since been filed. No deficiencies
for any material Tax  have been proposed in writing, asserted or assessed
(tentatively or  definitely), in each case, by any taxing authority, against
UPR or any of  its subsidiaries for which there are not adequate reserves.
Neither UPR nor  any of its subsidiaries is the subject of any currently
ongoing Tax audit  except for those that are, individually or in the
aggregate, immaterial.  There are no pending requests for waivers of the time
to assess any  material Tax, other than those made in the ordinary course and
for which  payment has been made or there are adequate reserves. Neither UPR
nor any  of its subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations in respect
of  Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax
assessment  or deficiency. There are no liens with respect to material Taxes
upon any  of the properties or assets, real or personal, tangible or
intangible of  UPR or any of its subsidiaries (other than liens for Taxes not
yet due). To  the knowledge of UPR, no claim has ever been made in writing by
an  authority in a jurisdiction where none of UPR and its subsidiaries
files  Tax Returns that UPR or any of its subsidiaries is or may be subject
to  taxation by that jurisdiction. Neither UPR nor any of its subsidiaries
has  filed an election under Section 341(f) of the Code to be treated as a 
consenting corporation.   (b) Neither UPR nor any of its subsidiaries is
obligated by any  contract, agreement or other arrangement to indemnify any
other person with  respect to material Taxes. Neither UPR nor any of its
subsidiaries are now  or have ever been a party to or bound by any agreement
or arrangement  (whether or not written and including, without limitation,
any arrangement  required or permitted by law) binding UPR or any of its
subsidiaries that  (i) requires UPR or any of its subsidiaries to make any
Tax payment to or  for the account of any other person, (ii) affords any
other person the  benefit of any net operating loss, net capital loss,
investment Tax credit,  foreign Tax credit, charitable deduction or any other
credit or Tax  attribute which could reduce Taxes (including, without
limitation,  deductions and credits related to alternative minimum Taxes) of
UPR or any  of its subsidiaries, or (iii) requires or permits the transfer
or  assignment of income, revenues, receipts or gains to UPR or any of its 
subsidiaries, from any other person.   (c) UPR and its subsidiaries have
withheld and paid all material Taxes  required to have been withheld and paid
in connection with amounts paid or  owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, shareholder or  other third party.   (d) Neither UPR
nor any of its subsidiaries is responsible for any  material Taxes of any
other person under Treasury Regulation Section  1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a  transferee, by contract, or
otherwise.   (e) Neither UPR nor any of its subsidiaries has constituted
either a  "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within
the  meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of
stock  intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the
Code  (i) in the two years prior to the date of this Agreement (or will 
constitute such a corporation in the two years prior to the date of the 
Effective Time) or (ii) in a distribution which otherwise constitutes part 
of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of 
Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with the Merger.   4.11
COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. UPR is in compliance, and at all times since January 1,
1997 has been in compliance, with all Applicable Laws relating to UPR or its
business or properties, except where the failure to be in compliance
with such Applicable Laws, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on UPR. To the
knowledge of UPR, no investigation or review by any Governmental Authority
with respect to UPR is pending or threatened, nor   19    has any
Governmental Authority indicated in writing an intention to conduct the same,
other than those the outcome of which would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on UPR.   4.12 REGISTRATION STATEMENT;
JOINT PROXY STATEMENT. None of the information provided by UPR for inclusion
in the Registration Statement at the time it becomes effective and, in the
case of the Joint Proxy Statement, at the date of mailing and at the date of
the UPR Stockholders Meeting or the Anadarko Stockholders Meeting, will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Registration Statement and Joint Proxy Statement, except
for such portions thereof that relate only to Anadarko or its subsidiaries,
will each comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.   4.13 LITIGATION. There is no
Action pending or, to the knowledge of UPR, threatened against UPR or any
executive officer or director of UPR that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on UPR or a
material adverse effect on the ability of UPR to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. UPR is not subject to any outstanding order, writ,
injunction or decree that, individually or in the aggregate, insofar as can
be reasonably foreseen, would have a Material Adverse Effect on UPR or a
material adverse effect on the ability of UPR to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.   4.14 UPR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS   (a) For purposes
of this Agreement, the following terms have the  definitions given below:  
"UPR CONTROLLED GROUP LIABILITY" means any and all liabilities (i)  under
Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under section 302 of ERISA (iii) under  sections 412
and 4971 of the Code, (iv) as a result of a failure to  comply with the
continuation coverage requirements of section 601 et  seq. of ERISA and
section 4980B of the Code, and (v) under corresponding  or similar provisions
of foreign laws or regulations, other than such  liabilities that arise
solely out of, or relate solely to, the UPR  Employee Benefit Plans listed in
Section 4.14 of the UPR Disclosure  Schedule.   "UPR EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN"
means any UPR Employee Benefit Plan,  program, policy, practices, or other
arrangement providing benefits to  any current or former employee, officer or
director of UPR or any of its  subsidiaries or any beneficiary or dependent
thereof that is sponsored  or maintained by UPR or any of its subsidiaries or
to which UPR or any  of its subsidiaries contributes or is obligated to
contribute, whether  or not written, including without limitation any
employee welfare  benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,
any employee  pension benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(2) of
ERISA  (whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA) and any bonus,

is rendering or has rendered services thereto as an employee or  consultant
pursuant to which UPR or any subsidiary has any actual or  contingent

$500,000 in the aggregate.   "UPR PLAN" means any UPR Employee Benefit Plan
other than a  Multiemployer Plan.   20     (a) Section 4.14(a) to the
UPR Disclosure Schedule includes a complete  list of all material UPR
Employee Benefit Plans and all UPR Material  Employment Agreements.   (b)
With respect to each UPR Plan, UPR has delivered or made available  to
Anadarko a true, correct and complete copy of: (i) each writing  constituting
a part of such UPR Plan, including without limitation all plan  documents,
employee communications, benefit schedules, trust agreements,  and insurance
contracts and other funding vehicles; (ii) the most recent  Annual Report
(Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedule, if any; (iii)  the current
summary plan description and any material modifications  thereto, if any (in
each case, whether or not required to be furnished  under ERISA); (iv) the
most recent annual financial report, if any; (v) the  most recent actuarial
report, if any; and (vi) the most recent  determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service, if any. UPR has  delivered or made available to
Anadarko a true, complete and correct copy  of each UPR Material Employment
Agreement. Except as specifically provided  in the foregoing documents
delivered or made available to Anadarko, there  are no amendments to any UPR
Plan or UPR Material Employment Agreement that  have been adopted or
approved.   (c) Section 4.14(c) to the UPR Disclosure Schedule identifies
each UPR  Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning
of  Section 401(a) of the Code ("UPR QUALIFIED PLANS"). The Internal
Revenue  Service has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to
each  UPR Qualified Plan and the related trust that has not been revoked, or
such  a letter will be timely applied for, and, to the knowledge of UPR,
there  are no circumstances and no events have occurred that could
adversely  affect the qualified status of any UPR Qualified Plan or the
related trust.  Section 4.14(c) to the UPR Disclosure Schedule identifies
each UPR Plan  which is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section
501(c)(9), and  each such plan meets such requirements.   (d) All material
contributions required to be made to any UPR Plan by  applicable law or
regulation or by any plan document or other contractual  undertaking, and all
material premiums due or payable with respect to  insurance policies funding
any UPR Plan, for any period through the date  hereof have been timely made
or paid in full or, to the extent not required  to be made or paid on or
before the date hereof, either (i) have been fully  reflected on the
financial statements included in the UPR SEC Documents, or  (ii) items
omitted from the UPR SEC Documents could not reasonably be  expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on UPR. Each UPR Employee  Benefit Plan that is an
employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of  ERISA is either (i)
funded through an insurance company contract and is not  a "welfare benefit
fund" with the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or  (ii) unfunded.   (e)
With respect to each UPR Employee Benefit Plan, UPR and its  subsidiaries
have complied, and are now in compliance, in all material  respects, with all
provisions of ERISA, the Code and all laws and  regulations applicable to
such UPR Employee Benefit Plans and each UPR  Employee Benefit Plan has been
administered in all material respects in  accordance with its terms. There is
not now, nor, to the knowledge of UPR,  do any circumstances currently exist
that could give rise to, any  requirement for the posting of security with
respect to a UPR Plan or the  imposition of any lien on the assets of UPR or
any of its subsidiaries  under ERISA or the Code.   (f) With respect to
each UPR Plan that is subject to Title IV or  Section 302 of ERISA or Section
412 or 4971 of the Code: (i) there does not  exist any accumulated funding
deficiency within the meaning of Section 412  of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA, whether or not waived; (ii) no  reportable event within the meaning of
Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which  the 30-day notice requirement has not
been waived has occurred, and the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this agreement will not  result in the occurrence of any such
reportable event; (iii) all premiums  to the PBGC have been timely paid in
full; (iv) no liability (other than  for premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV
of ERISA has been or is expected  to be incurred by UPR or any of its
subsidiaries; and (v) the PBGC has not  instituted proceedings to terminate
any such UPR Plan and, to UPR\'s  knowledge, no condition exists that
presents a risk that such proceedings  will be instituted   21     or
which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the 
termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such UPR 
Plan.   (g) (i) No UPR Employee Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a 
Multiple Employer Plan; (ii) none of UPR and its subsidiaries nor any of 
their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six 
years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer 
Plan or Multiple Employer Plan; and (iii) none of UPR and its subsidiaries 
nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material 
Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full. With respect to 
each UPR Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan: (i) if UPR or any of its 
subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates were to experience 
a withdrawal or partial withdrawal from such plan, no material Withdrawal 
Liability would be incurred; and (ii) none of UPR and its subsidiaries, nor 
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has received any notification, nor 
does UPR have any knowledge that any such UPR Plan is in reorganization,  has
been terminated, is insolvent, or may reasonably be expected to be in 
reorganization, to be insolvent, or to be terminated.   (h) There does not
now exist, nor, to the knowledge of UPR, do any  circumstances exist that
could reasonably be expected to result in, any  material UPR Controlled Group
Liability that would be a liability of UPR or  any of its subsidiaries
following the Closing. Without limiting the  generality of the foregoing,
neither UPR nor, to the knowledge of UPR any  of its subsidiaries, nor any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates, has  engaged in any transaction described
in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or  4212 of ERISA.   (i) Section 4.14(i) to
the UPR Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list  of each UPR Employee Benefit
Plan or UPR Employment Agreement under which  the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby
could (either alone or in conjunction with  any other event) result in, cause
the accelerated vesting, funding or  delivery of, or materially increase the
amount or value of, any payment or  benefit to any employee, officer or
director of UPR or any of its  subsidiaries, or could limit the right of UPR
or any of its subsidiaries to  amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion
of assets from any UPR  Employee Benefit Plan or related trust or any UPR
Material Employment  Agreement or related trust.   (j) None of UPR and its
subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of UPR, any  other person, including any
fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited  transaction" (as defined in
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of  ERISA), which could subject any
of the UPR Employee Benefit Plans or their  related trusts, UPR, any of its
subsidiaries or any person that UPR or any  of its subsidiaries has an
obligation to indemnify, to any material tax or  material penalty imposed
under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of  ERISA.   (k) There are no
pending or threatened claims (other than claims for  benefits in the ordinary
course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been  asserted or instituted,
and to UPR\'s knowledge, no set of circumstances  exists which may reasonably
give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the  UPR Plans, any fiduciaries
thereof with respect to their duties to the UPR  Plans or the assets of any
of the trusts under any of the UPR Plans which  could reasonably be expected
to result in any material liability of UPR or  any of its subsidiaries to the
PBGC, the Department of Treasury, the  Department of Labor, any Multiemployer
Plan, any UPR Plan or any  participant in a UPR Plan.   (l) UPR, its
subsidiaries and each member of their respective business  enterprises have,
in all material respects, complied with the Worker  Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act and, in all material respects,  all similar state, local and
foreign laws.   (m) All UPR Employee Benefit Plans subject to the laws of
any  jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) have been maintained in 
accordance with all applicable requirements, (ii) if they are intended to 
qualify for special tax treatment, meet all requirements for such  treatment,
and (iii) if they are intended to be funded and/or book-reserved  are funded
and/or book-reserved in all material respects, as appropriate,  based upon
reasonable actuarial assumptions.   22     (o) The UPR Employees Thrift
Plan (the "ESOP") and the UPR TRASOP (the  "TRASOP") are each "employee stock
ownership plans" within the meaning of  Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code. Each
loan under which the ESOP is a  borrower (each, a "LOAN") meets the
requirements of Section 4975(d)(3) of  the Code. The Securities of UPR that
were acquired with such Loans are in  each case pledged as collateral for the
Loan with which they were acquired,  except to the extent they have been
released from such pledge and allocated  to the accounts of participants in
the ESOP in accordance with the  requirements of Treasury Regulations
Sections 54.4975-7 and 54.4975-11. The  TRASOP has no outstanding
indebtedness.   4.15 CONTRACTS. All written or oral contracts, agreements,
guarantees, leases and executory commitments other than UPR Plans to which
UPR or its subsidiaries is a party or by which its assets are bound which are
material to UPR (each a "UPR CONTRACT"), are valid and binding obligations of
UPR and, to the knowledge of UPR, the valid and binding obligation of each
other party thereto except such UPR Contracts that if not so valid and
binding would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on UPR. Neither UPR nor, to the knowledge of UPR, any other party
thereto is in violation of or in default in respect of, nor has there
occurred an event or condition that with the passage of time or giving of
notice (or both) would constitute a default under or permit the termination
of, any such UPR Contract except such violations or defaults under or
terminations that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on UPR. Set forth in Section 4.15 to the
UPR Disclosure Schedule is the amount of the annual premium currently paid by
UPR for its directors\' and officers\' liability insurance.   4.16 LABOR
MATTERS. UPR does not have any labor contracts or collective bargaining
agreements with any persons employed by UPR or any persons
otherwise performing services primarily for UPR. There is no labor strike,
dispute or stoppage pending or, to the knowledge of UPR, threatened against
UPR, and UPR has not experienced any labor strike, dispute or stoppage or
other material labor difficulty involving its employees since January 1,
1998. To the knowledge of UPR, since January 1, 1998, no campaign or other
attempt for recognition has been made by any labor organization or employees
with respect to employees of UPR or any of its subsidiaries.   4.17
UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except (i) as and to the extent disclosed
or reserved against on the balance sheet of UPR as of December 31, 1999
included in the UPR SEC Documents, or (ii) as incurred after the date thereof
in the ordinary course of business consistent with prior practice and not
prohibited by this Agreement, UPR does not have any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether, absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due, that, individually or in the
aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on UPR.   4.18 PERMITS; COMPLIANCE. UPR is in possession of
all material franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, variances, exemptions, consents, certificates, approvals and
orders necessary to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted (collectively, the "UPR Permits"), and
there is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of UPR, threatened regarding
any of the UPR Permits. UPR is not in conflict with, or in default or
violation of any of the UPR Permits, except for any such conflicts, defaults
or violations which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on UPR.   4.19 ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS. Except as disclosed in the UPR SEC Documents, (i) the properties,
operations and activities of UPR and its subsidiaries are in compliance with
all applicable Environmental Laws and all past noncompliance of UPR or any
UPR subsidiary with any Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits, has been
resolved without any pending, ongoing or future obligation, cost
or liability; (ii) UPR and its subsidiaries and the properties and operations
of UPR and its subsidiaries are not subject to any existing, pending or, to
the knowledge of UPR, threatened Action by or before any court or
Governmental Authority under any Environmental Law; (iii) except as allowed
by Environmental Permits or Environmental Laws, there has been no release of
any hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant into the environment by UPR
or its subsidiaries or in connection with their properties or operations; and
(iv) except as allowed by Environmental Permits or Environmental Laws, there
has been   23    no exposure of any person or property to any hazardous
substance, pollutant or contaminant in connection with the properties,
operations and activities of UPR and its subsidiaries, in each case, other
than those matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on UPR.   4.20
OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. UPR has received the written opinion
of Goldman, Sachs and Co., to the effect that, as of the date of this
Agreement, the Exchange Ratio is fair to the UPR Stockholders from a
financial point of view. UPR has heretofore provided copies of such opinions
to Anadarko and such opinions have not been withdrawn or revoked or
modified.   4.21 BOARD RECOMMENDATION; REQUIRED VOTE. The Board of Directors
of UPR, at a meeting duly called and held, has by unanimous vote of those
directors present (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and the UPR Stock Option Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, taken together, are fair to and in
the best interests of the UPR Stockholders, and (ii) resolved to recommend
that the holders of the shares of UPR Common Stock approve this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated herein, including the Merger (the "UPR BOARD
RECOMMENDATION"). The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of UPR Common Stock to approve the Merger is the only vote
of the holders of any class or series of UPR Common Stock necessary to adopt
the Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby.   4.22
STATE TAKEOVER LAWS; RIGHTS AGREEMENT. Prior to the execution of
this Agreement, the Board of Directors of UPR has taken all action necessary

that purports to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to
acquire or vote shares: (i) the execution of this Agreement, and the UPR
Stock Option Agreement, (ii) the Merger and (iii) the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the UPR Stock Option Agreement. The Amended and
Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of December 1, 1998 (the "UPR RIGHTS

"Stock Acquisition Date" or "Distribution Date" or "Triggering Event" (as
such terms are defined in the UPR Rights Agreement) will occur as a result of
the execution of this Agreement or the UPR Stock Option Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger pursuant to this Agreement or the acquisition or
transfer of shares of UPR Common Stock by Anadarko pursuant to the UPR Stock
Option Agreement and the UPR Rights Agreement will expire immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and the UPR Rights Agreement, as so amended, has not
been further amended or modified. Copies of all such amendments to the UPR
Rights Agreement have been previously provided to Anadarko.   ARTICLE V.

and to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree,  judgment,
injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or  permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts  consummation of the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by  this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of  this Agreement,
nothing in this Section 5.1(a) shall limit a party\'s  right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Article VII, so long as  such party has up to then
complied in all material respects with its  obligations under this Section
5.1(a). Each of Anadarko and UPR shall  use all reasonable efforts to take

Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable  efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause  to be done, and to

Agreement,  (A) neither Anadarko nor any of its subsidiaries shall be
required to  hold separate (including by trust or otherwise) or to divest any
of  their respective businesses or assets, or to take or agree to take any 
action or agree to any limitation that could reasonably be expected to  have
a Material Adverse Effect on   25     Anadarko and its subsidiaries
taken as a whole or a material adverse  effect on the business, assets,
liabilities, results of operations,  financial condition or prospects of
Anadarko combined with the Surviving  Corporation after the Effective Time,
(B) prior to the Effective Time,  neither UPR nor its subsidiaries shall be
required to hold separate  (including by trust or otherwise) or to divest any

have a  Material Adverse Effect on UPR and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole,  (C) neither Anadarko nor UPR nor their respective subsidiaries shall
be  required to take any action that could reasonably be expected to 
substantially impair the overall benefits expected, as of the date  hereof,
to be realized from consummation of the Merger and (D) neither  Anadarko nor
UPR shall be required to waive any of the conditions to the  Merger set forth
in Article VI as they apply to such party.   (b) TAX-FREE TREATMENT. Each of
the parties shall use its reasonable  efforts to cause the Merger to

ANNOUNCEMENTS. The initial press release concerning the  Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press  release. Unless
otherwise required by Applicable Laws or requirements of  the NYSE (and, in
that event, only if time does not permit), at all times  prior to the earlier
of the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement  pursuant to Section
7.1, Anadarko and UPR shall consult with each other  before issuing any press
release with respect to the Merger and the  transactions contemplated thereby
and shall not issue any such press  release prior to such consultation.  
(d) FARMOUTS. Except as set forth below, neither Anadarko nor UPR  shall
enter into any farmouts except farmouts in accordance with the  guidelines
for farmouts or similar transactions jointly developed by their  respective
Chief Executive Officers. Prior to the time such guidelines are  established,

ANADARKO STOCKHOLDERS MEETING. Anadarko shall take all action in  accordance
with the federal securities laws, the Delaware General  Corporation Law, the

notice of, convene and hold a special meeting  of Anadarko Stockholders (the
"ANADARKO STOCKHOLDERS MEETING") to be held  on the earliest practical date
determined in consultation with UPR, and to  obtain the consent and approval
of Anadarko Stockholders with respect to  the Share Issuance, the Anadarko
Board Amendment and the transactions  contemplated hereby. Anadarko shall
take all lawful action to solicit the  approval of the Share Issuance and the
Anadarko Board Amendment by the  Anadarko Stockholders and the Board of
Directors of Anadarko shall  recommend approval of the Share Issuance and the
Anadarko Board Amendment  by the Anadarko Stockholders (to the extent not
previously withdrawn  pursuant to Section 5.2(d)).   (b) PREPARATION OF
REGISTRATION STATEMENT. Anadarko shall, as soon as  is reasonably
practicable, prepare the Joint Proxy Statement for filing  with the
Commission and shall file the Joint Proxy Statement. Consistent  with the
timing for the Anadarko Stockholders Meeting and the UPR  Stockholders
Meeting as determined by Anadarko after consultation with UPR,  Anadarko
shall prepare and file the Registration Statement with the  Commission as
soon as is reasonably practicable following clearance of the  Joint Proxy
Statement by the Commission and shall use its reasonable  efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective by the  Commission as promptly as
practicable and to maintain the effectiveness of  the Registration Statement
through the Effective Time. If, at any time  prior to the Effective Time,
Anadarko shall obtain knowledge of any  information   26     pertaining
to Anadarko contained in or omitted from the Registration  Statement that
would require an amendment or supplement to the Registration  Statement or
the Joint Proxy Statement, Anadarko will so advise UPR in  writing and will
promptly take such action as shall be required to amend or  supplement the
Registration Statement and/or the Joint Proxy Statement.  Anadarko shall
promptly furnish to UPR all information concerning it as may  be required for
supplementing the Joint Proxy Statement. Anadarko shall  cooperate with UPR
in the preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement in a  timely fashion and
shall use its reasonable efforts to assist UPR in  clearing the Joint Proxy
Statement with the Staff of the Commission.  Consistent with the timing of
the Anadarko Stockholders Meeting and the UPR  Stockholder Meeting, Anadarko
shall use all reasonable efforts to mail at  the earliest practicable date to
Anadarko Stockholders the Joint Proxy  Statement, which Joint Proxy Statement
shall include all information  required under Applicable Law to be furnished
to Anadarko Stockholders in  connection with the Share Issuance and shall
include the Anadarko Board  Recommendation to the extent not previously
withdrawn in compliance with  Section 5.2(d) and the written opinion of the
Anadarko Financial Advisor  described in Section 3.21. Anadarko shall also
take such other reasonable  actions (other than qualifying to do business in
any jurisdiction in which  it is not so qualified) required to be taken under
any applicable state  securities laws in connection with the issuance of
Anadarko Common Shares  in the Merger. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the  Registration Statement or to the Joint Proxy Statement
will be made by  Anadarko without providing UPR the opportunity to review and
comment  thereon. Anadarko will advise UPR, promptly after it receives
notice  thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective  or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any
stop  order, the suspension of the qualification of Anadarko Common Shares 
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any 
jurisdiction, or any request by the Commission for amendment of the Joint 
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and 
responses thereto or requests by the Commission for additional
information.   (c) CONDUCT OF ANADARKO\'S OPERATIONS. Anadarko shall conduct
its  operations in the ordinary course except as expressly contemplated by
this  Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall use all 
reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve its business organization and 
its material rights and franchises and to retain the services of its 
officers and key employees and maintain relationships with customers, 
suppliers, lessees, joint venture partners, licensees and other third 
parties, and to maintain all of its operating assets in their current 
condition (normal wear and tear excepted), to the end that their goodwill 
and ongoing business shall not be impaired in any material respect. Without 
limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period from the date  of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, Anadarko shall not, except as 
otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement and the transactions

or otherwise acquire, any  shares of its capital stock or any securities or
obligations convertible  into or exchangeable for any shares of its capital
stock, (C) grant any  person any right or option to acquire any shares of its
capital stock,  (D) issue, deliver or sell or agree to issue, deliver or sell
any  additional shares of its capital stock or any securities or

encumbrances in the ordinary course of business,  consistent with past

directors, officers,  employees, agents or representatives, directly or
indirectly, to solicit,  initiate, encourage or facilitate, or furnish or
disclose non-public  information in furtherance of, any inquiries or the
making of any proposal  with respect to any recapitalization, merger,

acquisition of 15% or more  of the capital stock (other than upon exercise of
Anadarko Options that are  outstanding as of the date hereof) or 30% or more
of the assets of Anadarko  and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a
single transaction or a series  of related transactions, or any combination

Subcorp or their respective  directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives) with respect to  any Anadarko Competing Transaction or enter
into any agreement, arrangement  or understanding requiring it to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate  the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;  PROVIDED that, at any time prior to the
approval of the Share Issuance by  the Anadarko Stockholders, Anadarko may
furnish information to, and engage  in discussions with, any party who
delivers a written proposal for an  Anadarko Competing Transaction which was
not solicited or encouraged after  the date of this Agreement in violation of
this Agreement if and so long as  the Board of Directors of Anadarko
determines in good faith by resolution  duly adopted after consultation with
its outside counsel (who may be its  regularly engaged outside counsel) that
the failure to take such action  would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties  under Applicable Law and determines that such
a proposal is, after  consulting with the Anadarko Financial Advisor, more
favorable to Anadarko  Stockholders from a financial point of view than the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustment to the
terms   29     and conditions proposed by UPR in response to such
Anadarko Competing  Transaction) (an "ANADARKO SUPERIOR PROPOSAL"); PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that  prior to furnishing information to, or engaging in discussions
with, any  party pursuant to the foregoing proviso, Anadarko shall have
received an  executed agreement from such party in the same form as the
Confidentiality  Agreement (other than Section 8 thereof which shall be
waived for UPR under  the Confidentiality Agreement upon the execution of
such agreement).  Anadarko will immediately cease all existing activities,
discussions and  negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any  proposal for an Anadarko Competing Transaction and request
the return of  all confidential information regarding Anadarko provided to
any such  parties prior to the date hereof pursuant to the terms of any 
confidentiality agreements or otherwise. In the event that prior to the 
approval of the Share Issuance by the Anadarko Stockholders, the Board of 
Directors of Anadarko receives an Anadarko Superior Proposal that was not 
solicited or encouraged after the date of this Agreement in violation of 
this Agreement, and the Board of Directors of Anadarko determines in good 
faith by resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside  counsel
(who may be its regularly engaged outside counsel) that the failure  to take
such action would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of  its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, the Board of Directors of  Anadarko
may (subject to this and the following sentences) withdraw, modify  or
change, in a manner adverse to UPR, the Anadarko Board Recommendation  and/or
comply with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with  respect to an
Anadarko Competing Transaction, PROVIDED that it gives UPR  three business
days\' prior written notice of its intention to do so  (PROVIDED that the
foregoing shall in no way limit or otherwise affect  UPR\'s right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.4(b)). Any  such withdrawal,
modification or change of the Anadarko Board  Recommendation shall not change
the approval of the Board of Directors of  Anadarko for purposes of causing
any state takeover statute or other state  law to be inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including  the Merger or the Anadarko Stock
Option Agreement or change the obligation  of Anadarko to present the Share
Issuance for approval at a duly called  Anadarko Stockholders Meeting on the
earliest practicable date determined  in consultation with UPR. From and
after the execution of this Agreement,  Anadarko shall promptly (but in any
event within one calendar day) advise  UPR in writing of the receipt,
directly or indirectly, of any inquiries,  discussions, negotiations, or
proposals relating to an Anadarko Competing  Transaction (including the
specific terms thereof and the identity of the  other party or parties
involved) and promptly furnish to UPR a copy of any  such written proposal in
addition to any information provided to or by any  third party relating
thereto. In addition, Anadarko shall promptly (but in  any event within one
calendar day) advise UPR, in writing, if the Board of  Directors of Anadarko
shall make any determination as to any Anadarko  Competing Transaction as
contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence  of this Section
5.2(d).   (e) INDEMNIFICATION; DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\' INSURANCE.   (i)
From and after the Effective Time, Anadarko shall cause the  Surviving
Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless (including  providing funding
therefor) the present and former officers and  directors of UPR in respect of
acts or omissions occurring prior to the  Effective Time to the extent
provided under the UPR Articles or the UPR  Bylaws, and   (ii) Anadarko
shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the  Surviving Corporation or
Anadarko to obtain and maintain in effect for a  period of six years after
the Effective Time policies of directors\' and  officers\' liability
insurance at no cost to the beneficiaries thereof  with respect to acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time  with substantially the same
coverage and containing substantially  similar terms and conditions as
existing policies; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,  that neither the Surviving Corporation
nor Anadarko shall be required to  pay an aggregate premium for such
insurance coverage in excess of 200%  of the amount set forth in Section 4.15
to the UPR Disclosure Schedule;  PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the annual
premiums of such insurance  coverage exceed such amount, Anadarko shall be
obligated to obtain a  policy with the best coverage available, in the
reasonable judgment of  the Board of Directors of Anadarko, for a cost not
exceeding such  amount.   30     (f) NYSE LISTING. Anadarko shall use
its reasonable efforts to cause  the Anadarko Common Shares issuable pursuant
to the Merger (including  pursuant to Anadarko Exchange Options) to be
approved for listing on the  NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Effective Time.   (g) ACCESS. Anadarko shall permit
representatives of UPR to have  access at all reasonable times to Anadarko\'s
premises, properties, books,  records, contracts, documents, customers and
suppliers. Information  obtained by UPR pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be
subject to the  provisions of the confidentiality agreement between Anadarko
and UPR dated  February 22, 2000 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), which
agreement  remains in full force and effect. No investigation conducted
pursuant to  this Section 5.2 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or  warranty made in this Agreement.   (h) BOARD OF
DIRECTORS OF ANADARKO. At the Anadarko Stockholders  Meeting, Anadarko shall
take all action necessary in accordance with  Applicable Law, the Anadarko
Certificate and the Anadarko By-Laws to have  the Anadarko Stockholders
consider and vote upon an amendment to the  Anadarko Certificate to increase
the size of the Board of Directors of  Anadarko to at least 13 members (the
"ANADARKO BOARD AMENDMENT"). In the  event that the Anadarko Board Amendment
is approved, then the Board of  Directors of Anadarko shall take all action
necessary immediately following  the Effective Time to elect as directors of
Anadarko Mr. CEO, and four  other independent directors who are currently
members of the Board of  Directors of UPR as may be mutually agreed by the
Chief Executive Officer  of Anadarko and the Chief Executive Officer of UPR
prior to the Effective  Time. In the event that the Anadarko Stockholders do
not approve the  Anadarko Board Amendment, the Board of Directors of Anadarko
shall take all  action necessary immediately following the Effective Time to
elect as  directors of Anadarko Mr. George Lindahl III, and two other
independent  directors who are currently members of the Board of Directors of
UPR as may  be mutually agreed by the Chief Executive Officer of Anadarko and
the Chief  Executive Officer of UPR prior to the Effective Time. The former
UPR  directors elected as directors of Anadarko shall be appointed among
Classes  I, II and III with a minimum of one director per Class.   (i)
SUBSEQUENT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Anadarko shall consult with UPR  prior to
making publicly available its financial results for any period  after the
date of this Agreement and prior to filing any Anadarko SEC  Documents after
the date of this Agreement.   (j) EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.   (A)
From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall assume and
honor all UPR Plans and UPR Employment Agreements in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, subject to
any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such terms.
Until at least the first anniversary of the Effective Time (the "BENEFITS
TRANSITION PERIOD"), Anadarko shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
to individuals who are, immediately before the Effective Time, employees of
UPR and its subsidiaries who are not subject to collective bargaining (the
"UPR EMPLOYEES"), employee benefits, other than equity-based benefits, that
are, in the aggregate, comparable to the benefits, other than equity-based
benefits, provided to UPR Employees under the UPR Plans immediately before
the Effective Time (the "UPR BENEFITS"). Following the end of the Benefits
Transition Period, or, at its discretion, prior to the end of the Benefits
Transition Period, in lieu of the UPR Benefits, Anadarko shall provide, or
cause to be provided, to UPR employees, employee benefits that are in the
aggregate comparable to those provided, to similarly situated employees of
Anadarko. The foregoing shall not be construed to prevent the termination of
employment of any UPR Employee or the amendment or termination of any
particular UPR Employee Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by its terms as
in effect immediately before the Effective Time.   (B) For all purposes
under the employee benefit plans of Anadarko and its affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation) providing benefits to any UPR Employees after the
Effective Time (the "NEW PLANS"), each UPR Employee shall be credited with
his or her years of service with UPR and its subsidiaries before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such UPR Employee was entitled,
before the   31    Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar UPR Employee Benefit Plans, except for purposes of benefit accrual
under defined benefit pension plans and except as would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing: (i) each UPR Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable UPR
Employee Benefit Plan in which such UPR Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the "OLD PLANS"); and
(ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any UPR Employee, Anadarko shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, and
Anadarko shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employee\'s participation in the corresponding New
Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.   (C) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, following
the Effective Time, and until such time as Anadarko shall otherwise
determine, the ESOP shall continue in effect holding the Anadarko Common
Shares that it receives in the Merger, and the Loans shall continue to remain
outstanding and be repaid in accordance with their terms.   5.3 COVENANTS
OF UPR.   (a) UPR STOCKHOLDERS MEETING. UPR shall take all action in
accordance  with the federal securities laws, the UBCA and the UPR Articles
and the UPR  Bylaws necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold

held on  the earliest practicable date determined in consultation with
Anadarko to  consider and vote upon approval of the Merger, this Agreement
and the  transactions contemplated hereby. UPR shall take all lawful actions
to  solicit the approval of the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions 
contemplated hereby, by the UPR Stockholders, and the Board of Directors of 
UPR shall recommend approval of the Merger, this Agreement and the

previously withdrawn pursuant to Section 5.3(d)).   (b) INFORMATION FOR THE
REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND PREPARATION OF  JOINT PROXY STATEMENT. UPR shall
promptly furnish Anadarko with all  information concerning it as may be
required for inclusion in the Joint  Proxy Statement and the Registration
Statement. UPR shall cooperate with  Anadarko in the preparation of the Joint
Proxy Statement and the  Registration Statement in a timely fashion and shall
use all reasonable  efforts to assist Anadarko in having the Registration
Statement declared  effective by the Commission as promptly as practicable
consistent with the  timing for the Anadarko Stockholders Meeting and the UPR
Stockholders  Meeting as determined by Anadarko after consultation with UPR.

written notice of its intention to do so (PROVIDED that the foregoing shall
