representatives with access to the books, records, facilities,

later than 60 days after the Closing Date. After receipt of the

Valuation Date Statement, together with the work papers used in the
preparation thereof.  Unless Buyer delivers written notice to Sellers
on or prior to the 60th day after Buyer's receipt of the Valuation
Date Statement specifying all disputed items and the basis therefor,
Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Valuation
Date Statement. If Buyer so notifies Sellers of its objection to the
Valuation Date Statement, Sellers and Buyer shall, within 30 days
following such notice (the "Resolution Period"), attempt to resolve
                            -----------------
their differences and any resolution by them as to any disputed
amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive.

          (d)  At the conclusion of the Resolution Period, all amounts
remaining in dispute shall be submitted to Deloitte & Touche (the
"Neutral Auditors").  In the event that Deloitte & Touche is unwilling

unable to agree on a substitute therefor, Buyer or Sellers may request
the American Arbitration Association to appoint a nationally
recognized accounting firm to act as Neutral Auditor hereunder who
shall not have had a material relationship with Sellers or Buyer or
any of their Affiliates within the past two years. Each party agrees
to execute, if requested by the Neutral Auditors, a reasonable
engagement letter. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any,
to be performed by the Neutral Auditors shall be borne equally by
Sellers and Buyer. The Neutral Auditors shall act as an arbitrator to
determine, based solely on presentations by Sellers and Buyer, and not
by independent review, only those issues still in dispute. The Neutral
Auditors' determination shall be made within 30 days of their
selection, whether or not such presentations by Sellers and Buyer have
been made within such period, and shall be set forth in a written
statement delivered to Sellers and Buyer and shall be final, binding
and conclusive. The term "Adjusted Valuation Date Statement," as

determinations made by the Neutral Auditors in accordance with this
Section 3.2(d) (in addition to those items theretofore agreed to by

the Adjusted Valuation Date Statement shall not be less than that
specified by Buyer in its notice to Sellers pursuant to subsection (c)
above nor more than that specified by Sellers on the Valuation Date
Statement.

          (e)  The Closing Purchase Price shall be increased or
decreased, as the case may be, dollar for dollar, to the extent the
Net Working Capital Amount reflected in the Adjusted Valuation Date
Statement is greater than or less than $7,304,000, as the case may be.

Price pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall bear interest from the

Closing Date through the date of payment at the Agreed Rate in effect
from time to time from the Closing Date to the date of such payment.
The amount of any reduction of the Closing Purchase Price pursuant to
this Section 3.2(e), together with interest thereon, shall be paid by
     --------------
wire transfer in immediately available funds by the Escrow Agent from
the Escrow Account to the account specified by Buyer pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, and the balance of the Escrow Fund, if
any, shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to the account specified by
Sellers pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.  If the Escrow Fund is
insufficient to pay Buyer the amount of the reduction of the Closing
Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 3.2(e), then the balance of
                                --------------
such reduction of the Closing Purchase Price shall be paid by wire
transfer in immediately available funds by Sellers to the account
specified by Buyer.  The amount of any increase to the Closing
Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 3.2(e), together with interest
                                --------------
thereon, shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds
by Buyer to the account specified by Sellers.  In the event of any
increase in the Closing Purchase Price pursuant to this Section
                                                        -------
3.2(e), then the Escrow Fund shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to the
------
account specified by Sellers pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.  Such
payment or transfer, as the case may be, shall be made within five
business days after the Adjusted Valuation Date Statement is agreed to
by Buyer and Sellers or any remaining disputed items are ultimately
determined by the Neutral Auditors.

                           -----------

               ACTION PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE
               --------------------------------

          The respective parties hereto covenant and agree to take the
following actions between the date hereof and the Closing Date:

          Section 7.1.  Access to Information.  Sellers shall afford
                        ---------------------
to the officers, employees and authorized representatives of Buyer
(including, without limitation, independent public accountants,
attorneys, financial advisors and other consultants and advisors)
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable
advance notice, to the offices, properties, employees and business and
financial records (including computer files, retrieval programs and
similar documentation) of the Business to the extent Buyer shall
reasonably deem necessary or desirable and shall furnish to Buyer or
its authorized representatives such additional information concerning
the Business as shall be reasonably requested; provided, however, that
                                               --------  -------
Sellers shall not be required to violate any obligation of
confidentiality to any Person who is not an Affiliate of Sellers or
Viskase Brazil to which Sellers or Viskase Brazil is subject or to
waive any privilege which any of them may possess in discharging their
obligations pursuant to this Section 7.1 (it being understood that
                             -----------
this limitation shall not apply in the case of any liabilities and
claims to be assumed by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.3(d)); and
                                          --------------
provided further, however, that to the extent that any privilege
-------- -------  -------
applies in the case of other matters, that the respective Seller and
Buyer shall enter into a confidentiality and common interest
agreement, similar to the Confidentiality and Common Interest
Agreement dated as of May 26, 2000 between Buyer and Parent, relating
to such other matters.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
understood and agreed that all requests for access pursuant to this
Section 7.1 shall be submitted or directed exclusively to Gordon S.
-----------
Donovan and, without his prior approval (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), Buyer shall not initiate, or cause
to be initiated, communication with any employee or customer of the
Companies with respect to the Business and a representative of Seller
shall be given reasonable advance notice and a reasonable opportunity
to participate in any such approved communication.  Buyer agrees that
such investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the operations of Viskase Brazil or
Sellers.  If in the course of any investigation pursuant to this
Section 7.1, Buyer's officers, employees or authorized representatives
-----------
discover any breach of any representation or warranty contained in
this Agreement, or any circumstance or condition that upon Closing
would constitute such a breach, Buyer covenants that it will promptly
so inform Sellers.

          Section 7.2.  Notifications.  Each of Buyer and Sellers
                        -------------
shall promptly notify the other of any action, suit or proceeding that
shall be instituted or threatened against such party to restrain,
prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.  Each party hereto shall promptly
notify the other of any lawsuit, claim, proceeding or investigation
that may be threatened, brought, asserted or commenced against Viskase
Brazil, Newco Brazil, Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, that would
have been listed in Schedule 5.13 or Schedule 6.3, as the case may be,
                    -------------    ------------
if such lawsuit, claim, proceeding or investigation had arisen prior
to the date hereof.

          Section 7.3.  Consents of Third Parties; Governmental
                        ---------------------------------------
Approvals; Commercially Reasonable Efforts.  (a)  Sellers and Buyer
------------------------------------------
will act diligently and reasonably in attempting to secure, before the
Closing Date, the consent, approval or waiver, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the other party, required to be obtained
from any party (other than a Governmental Body) to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
                                             --------  -------
such action shall not include any requirement of Sellers or any of
their Affiliates (including Viskase Brazil and Newco Brazil) to expend
money, commence or participate in any litigation or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party.

          (b)  During the period prior to the Closing Date, Buyer
shall act diligently and reasonably, and Sellers, upon the request of
Buyer, shall use its reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer, in
attempting to secure any consents and approvals of any Governmental
Body required to be obtained by Buyer in order to permit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (c)  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as
expeditiously as practicable.

                        ------------------------------------
Each Asset Seller shall, and Sellers shall cause Viskase Brazil and
Newco Brazil to, use commercially reasonable efforts to operate and

Viskase Brazil and Newco Brazil to, use its commercially reasonable
efforts consistent with good business practice to preserve the
goodwill of the suppliers, contractors, licensors, employees,
customers and distributors of the Business.

          (b)  Notwithstanding Section 7.4(a), except as set forth on
                               --------------

       otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of the Business
       and other than Permitted Encumbrances;

          (v)  create, incur or assume, or agree to create, incur or
       assume, any indebtedness for borrowed money (other than money
       borrowed or advances from any of its Affiliates in the ordinary
       course of business);

          (vi)  make, or agree to make, any payment or distribution of
       assets (other than cash) to any of its Affiliates (other than
       intercompany transactions in accordance with past practices);

         (vii)  institute any increase in any profit-sharing, bonus,
       incentive, deferred compensation, insurance, pension,
       retirement, medical, hospital, disability, welfare or other
       employee benefit plan with respect to its employees, other than
       as required by any such plan or Requirements of Law;

         (viii)  make any change in the compensation of its employees,
       other than changes made in accordance with normal compensation
       practices or pursuant to existing contractual commitments and
       consistent with past compensation practices;

         (ix)  make any change in the accounting policies applied in
       the preparation of the Financial Statements, unless such change

          (x)  issue any capital stock (or securities exchangeable,
       convertible or exercisable for capital stock) of Newco Brazil
       other than to Sellers.

          Section 7.5.  Antitrust Law Compliance.  As promptly as
                        ------------------------
practicable after the date hereof (and in any event within 10 business
days after the date hereof), Buyer and Sellers shall file all
notifications and other information required to be filed under the HSR
Act, or any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and, if
necessary, any other Competition Laws, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby.  Each party warrants that all such
filings by it will be, as of the date filed, true and accurate in all
material respects and in material compliance with the requirements of
the Competition Laws and any such rules and regulations.  The parties
agree to seek early termination with respect to the waiting period
under the HSR Act.  Each of Buyer and Sellers agrees to make available
to the other such information as each of them may reasonably request
relative to its business, assets and property as may be required of
each of them to file any additional information requested by such
agencies under the Competition Laws and any such rules and
regulations.

          Section 7.6.  Intercompany Obligations.  Sellers shall take
                        ------------------------
such action as may be necessary so that, as of the Closing Date, there
shall be no intercompany obligations between the Companies and their
Affiliates relating to the Business.

          Section 7.7.  Release of Guaranties.  With respect to any
                        ---------------------

successors and assigns against and hold them harmless from all Losses
or Expenses incurred by them for damages caused by the removal of the
Purchased Assets from the plant in Lindsay, Ontario but will not
restore the premises to original condition.

          (b)  It is understood that Buyer does not contemplate making
offers to employees at the plant in Lindsay, Ontario.  Viskase Canada

employment agreements with such employees and any obligations pursuant
to any agreement with a union.

                             ------------
                        ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

          Section 8.1.  Use of Names.  (a)  Sellers are not conveying
                        ------------
ownership rights or granting Buyer or its Affiliates (including Newco
Brazil after the Closing) a license to use any of the tradenames or
trademarks of Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers, including the
"Viskase" trademark (other than as provided in Section 8.1(b) and the
                                               --------------
Trademarks identified on Schedule 5.11(a)) and, after the Closing,
                         ----------------
Buyer and its Affiliates (including Newco Brazil after the Closing)
shall not use in any manner such names or marks of Sellers or any
Affiliate of Sellers or any word that is similar in sound or
appearance to such names or marks.  In the event Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer violates any of its obligations under this Section
                                                              -------
8.1, Sellers and their Affiliates may proceed against it in law or in
---
equity for such damages or other relief as a court may deem
appropriate.  Buyer acknowledges that a violation of this Section 8.1
                                                          -----------
may cause Sellers and their Affiliates irreparable harm which may not
be adequately compensated for by money damages.  Buyer therefore
agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened violation of this
Section 8.1, Sellers and any of their Affiliates shall be entitled, in
-----------
addition to other remedies that they may have, to a temporary
restraining order and to preliminary and final injunctive relief
against Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer to prevent any violations of
this Section 8.1, without the necessity of posting a bond.
     -----------
          (b)  Sellers hereby grant to Buyer for 24 months following
the Closing Date with respect to inventory and packaging material in
stock as of the Closing Date and 60 days following the Closing Date
with respect to signage and stationery and 180 days after the Closing
Date with respect to promotional matters, each of which shall relate
primarily to the Business, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, fully-
paid and royalty-free license to use the "Viskase" name (the "Mark")
                                                              ----
in connection with the transition of the names used by the Business to
new names.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and its Affiliates
(including Newco Brazil after the Closing) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to change all references to the Mark as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, and shall make clear in all
correspondence and communications made by Buyer that the Business is
no longer owned by Sellers.

          Section 8.2.  Tax Matters.  (a)  Liability for Taxes.  (i)
                        -----------        --------------------
Sellers shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to Article XI (and
                                                     ----------
subject to the limitations thereof) agree to indemnify and hold
harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against any and all Taxes
(A) imposed on Newco Brazil pursuant to Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.1502-6 or
similar provision of state, local or foreign law solely as a result of
Newco Brazil having been a member of a Seller's Group, (B) imposed on
Newco Brazil as a result of the Brazil Transactions, (C) imposed on
Newco Brazil, or for which Newco Brazil may otherwise be liable, or
(D) applicable to the Business and the Purchased Assets, in each case
attributable to any taxable year or period that ends on or before the
Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date;
provided, however, with respect to Taxes other than income or
--------  -------
franchise Taxes of the Business, only to the extent that the amount of
such other Taxes exceeds the amount of such other Taxes that have been
provided for in the Valuation Date Statement, provided, further, that
                                              --------  -------
Sellers shall not be liable for or pay, and do not agree to indemnify
and hold harmless each Buyer Group Member from and against, (I) any
Taxes that result from any actual or deemed election under Section 338
of the Code or any similar provisions of state, local or foreign law
as a result of the purchase of the Newco Brazil Shares or that result
from Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer, or Newco Brazil engaging in any
activity or transaction that would cause the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be treated as a purchase or sale of assets of
Newco Brazil for federal, state, foreign or local Tax purposes and
(II) any Taxes imposed on Newco Brazil, or for which Newco Brazil may
otherwise be liable, as a result of transactions occurring on the
Closing Date that are properly allocable (based on, among other
relevant factors, factors set forth in Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.1502-
76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing
(Taxes described in this proviso, hereinafter "Excluded Taxes").
                                               --------------
Buyer and Sellers agree that, with respect to any transaction
described in clause (II) of the preceding sentence, Newco Brazil and
all persons related to Newco Brazil under Section 267(b) of the Code
immediately after the Closing shall treat the transaction for all
federal income Tax purposes (in accordance with Treas. Reg.
Sec. 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)), and (to the extent permitted) for other
income Tax purposes, as occurring at the beginning of the day
following the Closing Date.  Sellers shall be entitled to any refund
of (or credit for) Taxes allocable to any taxable year or period that
ends on or before the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle
Period, the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including
the Closing Date.


         (ii)  Buyer shall be liable for and pay, and pursuant to
       Article XI (and subject to the limitations thereof) agrees to
       indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group Member from and
       against, (A) any and all Taxes imposed on Newco Brazil, or for
       which Newco Brazil may otherwise be liable and (B) all Taxes
       applicable to the Business or the Purchased Assets, in each
       case applicable to any taxable year or period that begins after
       the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the
       portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing
       Date and (C) Excluded Taxes.  Except as otherwise provided
       herein, Buyer shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit
       for) Taxes allocable to any taxable year or period that begins
       after the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle
       Period, the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the
       Closing Date, to the extent the refund relates to any Taxes
       imposed on Buyer.

           (iii)  For purposes of paragraphs (a)(i) and (a)(ii),
       whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes
       of Newco Brazil or with respect to the Business and the
       Purchased Assets for a Straddle Period, the determination of
       the Taxes of Newco Brazil or with respect to the Business and
       the Purchased Assets for the portion of the Straddle Period
       ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period
       beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by
       assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable
       years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing
       Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day
       following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain,
       deduction, loss or credit of Newco Brazil or with respect to
       the Business and the Purchased Assets for the Straddle Period
       shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on
       a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of
       Newco Brazil or the Purchased Assets were closed at the close
       of the Closing Date, provided, however, that (I) transactions
                            --------  -------
       occurring on the Closing Date that are properly allocable
       (based on, among other relevant factors, factors set forth in
       Treas. Reg. Sec. 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) with respect to federal
       law) to the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing shall
       be allocated to the taxable year or period that is deemed to
       begin at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date
       and (II) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
       calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for
       depreciation, shall be apportioned between such two taxable
       years or periods on a daily basis.  Notwithstanding the
       foregoing provisions of this paragraph (a)(iii), if the
       transactions contemplated by this Agreement result in the
       reassessment of the value of any property owned by Newco Brazil
       or of the Purchased Assets or assets of the Business for
       property Tax purposes, or the imposition of any property Taxes
       at a rate which is different than the rate that would have been
       imposed if such transactions had not occurred, then (y) the
       portion of such property Taxes for the portion of the Straddle
       Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be
       determined on a daily basis, using the assessed value and Tax
       rate that would have applied had such transactions not
       occurred, and (z) the portion of such property Taxes for the
       portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing
       Date shall be the total property Taxes for the Straddle Period
       minus the amount described in clause (y) of this sentence.

          (iv) If, as a result of any action, suit, investigation,
       audit, claim, assessment or amended Tax Return, there is any
       change after the Closing Date in an item of income, gain, loss,
       deduction, credit or amount of Tax that results in an increase
       in a Tax liability for which Sellers would otherwise be liable
       pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) of this Section 8.2, and such
                                            -----------
       change results in a decrease in the Tax liability of Newco
       Brazil, Buyer or any Affiliate or successor of any thereof for
       any taxable year or period beginning after the Closing Date or
       for the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the
       Closing Date, Sellers shall not be liable pursuant to such
       paragraph (a)(i) with respect to such increase to the extent of
       such decrease (and, to the extent such increase in Tax
       liability is paid to a taxing authority by Sellers or any
       Affiliate thereof, Buyer shall pay Sellers an amount equal to
       such decrease).

           (v)  Except as provided in Section 4.5, notwithstanding
                                      -----------
       anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall pay, and agrees to
       indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group Member from and
       against any and all real property transfer or gains Taxes,
       sales Taxes, use Taxes, stamp Taxes, stock transfer Taxes,
       asset transfer Taxes, or other similar Taxes imposed on the
       transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a purchaser
       under Requirements of Law; provided, however, that with respect
                                  --------  --------
       to the sale of the Newco Brazil Shares, Buyer agrees to
       reimburse Sellers for one-half of any applicable withholding
       Taxes imposed on Sellers under Requirements of Law (it being
       understood that Buyer shall not pay more than $750,000 under
       this proviso).  Buyer is agreeing to reimburse Sellers pursuant
       to the foregoing proviso, but is not hereby otherwise assuming
       any withholding Tax liability of Sellers.

           (vi)  Except as provided in Section 4.5, notwithstanding
                                       -----------
       anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall pay, and agree
       to indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Group Member from and
       against any and all real property transfer or gains Taxes,
       sales Taxes, use Taxes, stamp Taxes, stock transfer Taxes,
       asset transfer Taxes, or similar Taxes imposed on the
       transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a seller under
       Requirements of Law; provided, however, that with respect to
                            --------  -------
       the sale of the Newco Brazil Shares, Buyer agrees to make the
       payment as set forth in clause (v) above.

          (b)  Tax Returns.  (i)  Sellers shall timely file or cause
               -----------
to be timely filed when due (taking into account all extensions
properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are (x) required to be filed
by or with respect to Newco Brazil for taxable years or periods ending
on or before the Closing Date (in the case of income, franchise and
similar Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to Newco
Brazil as well as Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect
to Newco Brazil on a combined, consolidated or unitary basis with
Sellers or any Affiliate thereof) or (y) due on or before the Closing
Date (with respect to other Tax Returns), and in each case Sellers
shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such
Tax Returns, and Buyer shall timely file or cause to be timely filed
when due (taking into account all extensions properly obtained) all
other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to

filed by Buyer pursuant to the preceding sentence that relate to
taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date or that
relate to any Straddle Period (I) such Tax Returns shall be filed in a
manner consistent with past practice and no position shall be taken,
election made or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions
taken, elections made or methods used in prior periods in filing such
Tax Returns (including, without limitation, any such position,
election or method which would have the effect of accelerating income
to periods for which Sellers are liable or deferring deductions to
periods for which Buyer is liable) and (II) such Tax Returns shall be
submitted to Sellers not later than 30 days prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Returns (or, if such due date is within 45 days
following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the
Closing Date) for review and approval by Sellers, which approval may
not be unreasonably withheld, but may in all cases be withheld if such
Tax Returns were not prepared in accordance with clause (I) of this
sentence.  Sellers or Buyer shall pay the other party for the Taxes
for which Sellers or Buyer, respectively, is liable pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this Section 8.2 but which are payable with any Tax
                      -----------
Return to be filed by the other party pursuant to this paragraph (b)
upon the written request of the party entitled to payment, setting
forth in detail the computation of the amount owed by Sellers or
Buyer, as the case may be, but in no event earlier than 10 business
days prior to the due date for paying such Taxes.

         (ii)  None of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer shall (or shall
       cause or permit Newco Brazil to) amend, refile or otherwise
       modify (or grant an extension of any statute of limitation with
       respect to) any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to
       Newco Brazil or the Business or the Purchased Assets with
       respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before the
       Closing Date (or with respect to any Straddle Period) without
       the prior written consent of Sellers, which consent may not be
       unreasonably withheld.

          (iii)  Buyer shall promptly cause Newco Brazil to prepare
       and provide to Sellers a package of Tax information materials,
       including, without limitation, schedules and work papers (the
       "Tax Package") required by Sellers to enable Sellers to prepare
        -----------
       and file all Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed by
       it pursuant to paragraph (b)(i).  The Tax Package shall be
       completed in accordance with past practice, including past
       practice as to providing such information and as to the method
       of computation of separate taxable income or other relevant
       measure of income of Newco Brazil.  Buyer shall cause the Tax
       Package to be delivered to Sellers within 90 days after the
       Closing Date.

          (c)  Contest Provisions.  (i)  Buyer shall promptly notify
               ------------------
Sellers in writing upon receipt by Buyer, any of its Affiliates, or
Newco Brazil of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state,
local or foreign Tax audits, examinations or assessments which might
affect the Tax liabilities for which Sellers may be liable pursuant to
this Section 8.2.
     -----------

         (ii)  Sellers shall have the sole right to represent Newco
       Brazil's interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court
       proceeding relating to taxable periods ending on or before the
       Closing Date or otherwise relating to Taxes for which Sellers
       may be liable pursuant to this Section 8.2, and to employ
                                      -----------
       counsel of their choice at their expense.  Buyer shall be
       entitled to participate at its expense in any such audit or
       proceeding.  In the case of a Straddle Period, Sellers shall be
       entitled to participate at their expense in any Tax audit or
       administrative or court proceeding relating (in whole or in
       part) to Taxes attributable to the portion of such Straddle
       Period ending on and including the Closing Date and, with the
       written consent of Buyer, and at Sellers' sole expense, may
       assume the entire control of such audit or proceeding.  None of
       Buyer, any of its Affiliates, or Newco Brazil may settle any
       Tax claim for any Taxes for which Sellers may be liable
       pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Section 8.2, without the
                                         -----------
       prior written consent of Sellers, which consent may not be
       unreasonably withheld.

          (d)  Assistance and Cooperation.  After the Closing Date,
               --------------------------
each of Sellers and Buyer shall (and cause their respective Affiliates
to):

         (i)  assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns
       which such other party is responsible for preparing and filing
       in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section 8.2;
                                                -----------

          (ii)  cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or
       disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of
       Newco Brazil or with respect to the Business or the Purchased
       Assets;

           (iii)  make available to the other and to any taxing
       authority as reasonably requested all information, records, and
       documents relating to Taxes of Newco Brazil, the Business and
       the Purchased Assets;

            (iv)  provide timely notice to the other in writing of any
       pending or threatened Tax audits or assessments of Newco Brazil
       for taxable periods for which the other may have a liability
       under this Section 8.2;

            (v)  furnish the other with copies of all correspondence
       received from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax
       audit or information request with respect to any such taxable
       period;

           (vi)  timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as
       may be necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption from
       (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax Returns or other reports
       with respect to, Taxes described in paragraphs (a)(v) and
       (a)(vi) of this Section 8.2 (relating to sales, transfer and
                       -----------
       similar Taxes); and

           (vii)  timely provide to the other powers of attorney or
       similar authorizations necessary to carry out the purposes of
       this Section 8.2.
            -----------

          (e)  Election Under Section 338.  Sellers and Buyer agree
               --------------------------
that Buyer may, in its discretion, make any election under Section 338
of the Code or under any applicable similar provision of state or
foreign law with respect to Newco Brazil.

          Section 8.3.  Employee Matters ! Employees of Asset Sellers,
                        ----------------------------------------------
Other Than UK.  (a)  Effective as of the Closing Date, each Asset
-------------
Seller shall terminate the employment of, and Buyer shall offer

Pauls Valley, Oklahoma and Centerville, Iowa.  In addition, effective
as of the Closing Date, each Asset Seller shall terminate the
employment of, and Buyer shall offer employment to, virtually all
"Chicago" employees listed on Schedule 8.3(a) (any employees and
                              ---------------
individuals who accept such offers of employment from Buyer and
actually commence work with Buyer shall be referred to herein as the
"Affected Employees").  Buyer may offer employment to certain of the
 ------------------
individuals listed on Schedule 8.3(a) for a transition period;
                      ---------------
provided, however, that with respect to any individual that Buyer
--------  -------
offers employment for a transition period, Buyer may not condition the
offer of employment for a transition period on the individual's
relocation to any other job location (such individuals who accept
employment for a transition period shall be referred to herein as
"Transition Employees" and, unless otherwise specified, the term
"Affected Employee" shall include each Transition Employee).

          (b)  For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending
no earlier than the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall
take any action necessary so that each Affected Employee who continues
to be employed in the Business or otherwise by Buyer shall continue to
receive a level of employee benefits and base wages or salary, and
bonus, that, in the aggregate, is substantially similar to such
employee than the level of employee benefits and base wages or salary,
and bonus, paid or provided by the Asset Sellers to such Affected
Employee on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that Buyer
                                        --------  -------
shall in no event be required to offer retiree medical benefits to any
employee of Sellers (whether such benefits relate to pre-Closing or
post-Closing service).  In addition, Buyer agrees to provide, as of
the Closing Date, insurance and other similar benefits as are
available to employees of Buyer in similar jobs.  Sellers shall be
responsible for satisfying all requirements under Part 6 of Title I of
ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA") for continuation of
                                      -----
coverage under all plans of group health coverage maintained by
Sellers that is required to be provided before, on or after the
Closing Date to (i) any "qualified beneficiary" whose "qualifying
event" (as such terms are defined in COBRA) occurred prior to the
Closing Date, including any such individual whose period for electing
COBRA coverage has not expired as of the Closing Date, and (ii) any
Affected Employee or dependent of an Affected Employee whose
"qualifying event" with respect to Sellers' plans occurs on the
Closing Date.

          (c)  Sellers shall give notice to all Affected Employees
employed by the Asset Sellers that the active participation of such
employees in the Pension Plans and Welfare Plans of Sellers shall
terminate on the Closing Date, as of which date such employees shall
be eligible to participate in Buyer's benefit programs.  Except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Section 8.3, in no event shall
                                     -----------
any Affected Employee be entitled to accrue any benefits under the
Pension or Welfare Plans of Sellers with respect to services rendered
or compensation paid after the Closing.

          (d)  Sellers shall take all actions necessary to cause each
Affected Employee to be 100 percent vested in said employee's benefit
under the SAVE Program for Employees of Viskase Corporation (the "SAVE
                                                                  ----
Program") as of the Closing Date, and shall make all contributions
-------
under the SAVE Program (including any matching or other employer
contributions) for all periods prior to the Closing Date as soon as
administratively feasible after the Closing Date.  As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date (but in no event later than six
months after the Closing Date), Buyer shall take all necessary actions
so that each Affected Employee has the opportunity to elect a direct
rollover pursuant to Section 401(a)(31) of the Code of the employee's
benefit under the SAVE Program to any qualified defined contribution
plan maintained or established by Buyer in which the Affected Employee
is a participant on the date the direct rollover is to occur (or to
the plan designated by Buyer to accept the direct rollover in the
event the employee is a participant in more than one such plan).  Any
such direct rollover shall be made in cash, except that the direct
rollover may include any outstanding loan to the employee from the
employee's accounts in the SAVE Program.  Prior to any direct rollover
under this subsection, Buyer shall provide to Sellers the
certification required under the applicable IRS regulations relating
to rollover contributions regarding the qualified status of the plan
or plans of Buyer which will receive the direct rollovers, and Sellers
shall provide to Buyer the corresponding certification regarding the
qualified status of the SAVE Program.

          (e)  Buyer shall recognize all unused vacation of the
Affected Employees as of the Closing Date as shown on the Valuation
Date Statement, and Buyer shall provide such paid vacation.  Buyer
shall recognize the bonus programs for Affected Employees existing as
of the Closing Date and shall pay to the Affected Employees the
bonuses they have accrued under such programs at the end of the bonus
determination period as shown on the Valuation Date Statement, or
earlier if so determined by Buyer.

          (f)  Affected Employees shall be credited for their length
of service with the Companies for all purposes (other than for
determining pension benefit accruals) under Buyer's benefit plans as
if such service had been rendered to Buyer.

          (g)  Buyer shall (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to the
Affected Employees under any welfare or fringe benefit plan
(including, but not limited to, medical, dental and disability
coverage) in which such employees may be eligible to participate after
the Closing Date, and (ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
credit Affected Employees with any amounts paid under Sellers' Welfare
Plans prior to the Closing Date toward satisfaction of the applicable
deductible amounts, copayment minimums, coinsurance amounts and out of
pocket maximums under the corresponding Welfare Plans of Buyer to the
extent such amounts would be taken into account under the Welfare
Plans maintained by Buyer with respect to similarly situated
employees.

          (h)  Sellers shall remain responsible for all claims under
the applicable Welfare Plans of Sellers for health, accident and
sickness benefits that are deemed incurred by Affected Employees prior
to the Closing Date.  Buyer shall be liable and responsible for all
claims incurred for health, accident and sickness benefits that are
deemed incurred by Affected Employees on or after the Closing Date.
For all purposes under such Welfare Plans, Affected Employees will be
deemed to have terminated employment with Sellers as of the Closing
Date.  For purposes of this Agreement:  (i) a claim for health
benefits (including, without limitation, claims for medical,
prescription drug, dental, and vision care expenses) will be deemed to
have been incurred on the date that health benefits services giving
rise to such claim are provided, (ii) a claim for short-term or long-
term disability benefits shall be deemed to have been incurred on the
date the claim for such benefits is made (subject to the terms of
Section 8.3(i)) and (iii) in the case of any claim for any other
--------------
accident benefits, a claim will be deemed to have been incurred upon
the occurrence of the event giving rise to such claims.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, Buyer
shall have no liability for any such claim incurred by an Affected
Employee or a dependent of an Affected Employee on or after the
Closing Date if (i) such Affected Employee or dependent elected COBRA
coverage under Sellers' Welfare Plans before, on or after the Closing
Date and (ii) such claim is covered under that COBRA coverage.

          (i)  Sellers shall continue to be responsible for payment of
all short-term disability claims for any Covered Employee who is on
short-term disability at the Closing Date ("Disabled Employees"),
                                            ------------------
unless and until such Covered Employee actually commences work for
Buyer, at which time Buyer will be responsible for providing any
future short-term disability coverage.  Buyer will offer employment to
persons on short-term disability at Pauls Valley, Oklahoma and
Centerville, Iowa and to those persons listed in Schedule 8.3(a) when
                                                 ---------------
such persons are able to return to work.  Such persons will become
"Affected Employees" for purposes of this Agreement once they are
employed by Buyer.  Buyer will be responsible for providing long-term
disability coverage to any Covered Employee who commences work for
Buyer after Closing (to the same extent such coverage is available to
Buyer's other employees), except for Disabled Employees who move
directly to long-term disability coverage without reporting to work
with Buyer, and Sellers will be responsible for providing such long-
term disability coverage to such Disabled Employees.

          (j)  Attached hereto as Schedule 8.3(j) are copies of
                                  ---------------
Sellers' Severance Pay Policy, Severance Allowance Plan (Salaried) and
Severance Layoff Allowance Plan (Hourly) (the "Policies").  With
                                               --------
respect to any person listed on Schedule 8.3(a) who is not offered
                                ---------------
employment by Buyer (or who is offered employment with Buyer at a
lower salary than that in effect as of the Closing Date), Buyer agrees
to reimburse Sellers for any amounts paid by Sellers under the
Policies to any such person, as well as for any other costs incurred
by Sellers in satisfying all obligations under the Policies.  Except
as otherwise provided herein, Sellers shall be liable for all
severance pay obligations (under the Policies or otherwise) to any
persons listed on Schedule 8.3(a) who are offered employment by Buyer
                  ---------------
(under terms described in the first two sentences of Section 8.3(b)),
                                                     --------------
but who do not accept such offer or do not actually commence work for
Buyer.  Any person offered permanent employment by Buyer may accept a
temporary position with Buyer in which case any severance owed to such
employee shall not be payable until such temporary position with Buyer
has ended (which severance shall be payable by Sellers); provided,
                                                         --------
however, that if any such person then accepts a permanent position
-------
with Buyer, Buyer will then become responsible for severance
obligations to such persons under the Policies.  After the Closing
Date and for a period of twenty-four months thereafter, Buyer will be
responsible for, and pay, any severance liability of Sellers to any
Affected Employee whose employment with Buyer is terminated, provided
such persons are entitled to severance under the Severance Pay Policy
as a result of the occurrence of a "Change of Control" (as defined in
such Policy).

          (k)  Except as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this
Section or in the following sentence, Buyer shall be solely
responsible for (i) all liabilities, obligations and commitments
relating to all wages, salaries, bonuses and other forms of
compensation (including vacation pay) and related expenses incurred or
accrued on or after the Closing Date with respect to Affected
Employees, (ii) all employee benefits accrued after the Closing Date
under any and all plans, programs or arrangements maintained or
contributed to by Buyer for the benefit of Affected Employees and
(iii) all medical, dental and other health benefits or claims incurred
after the Closing Date (other than benefits or claims payable under
Sellers' Welfare Plans due to a COBRA election made by an Affected
Employee or a dependent of an Affected Employee).  Sellers shall
remain liable for providing retiree welfare benefits to all Affected
Employees who, as of the Closing Date, satisfy the eligibility
requirements for retiree welfare benefits under the applicable terms
and conditions of Sellers' Welfare Plans as in effect on the Closing
Date and shall provide such benefits in accordance with the terms of
such plans.  In no event shall Sellers be obligated to provide retiree
welfare benefits to Affected Employees who do not, as of the Closing
Date, satisfy the applicable eligibility requirements for retiree
welfare benefits under Sellers' Welfare Plans as in effect on the
Closing Date.

          (l)  Sellers shall be responsible for all liabilities or
obligations under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act and similar state, foreign and local rules, statutes and
ordinances resulting from Sellers' actions prior to the Closing.
Buyer shall be responsible for all liabilities or obligations under
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and similar
state, foreign and local rules, statutes and ordinances resulting from
the Closing or from Buyer's actions following the Closing.

          (m)  Except as otherwise provided in this Section or as
required by law, nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted as
limiting the power of Buyer to amend or terminate any particular plan
maintained by Buyer or as requiring Buyer to continue the employment
of any specific person for any particular time; provided, however,
that no such termination or amendment may take away benefits or any
other payments already accrued as of the time of termination or
amendment without the consent of such person, except as allowed by
law.


          (n)  After the date hereof, Sellers shall not amend any of
the Policies to provide greater benefits to any persons for whom Buyer
is or may be obligated to provide severance under this Section 8.3.
                                                       -----------

          (o)  Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and
hold harmless Sellers from and against, any and all Losses and
Expenses relating to or arising out of the liabilities assumed by
Buyer under this Section 8.3 or any failure by Buyer to comply with
                 -----------
the provisions of this Section 8.3.

(including each such employee who is on vacation, temporary layoff,
approved leave of absence, military leave, sick leave or short-term
disability) shall remain an employee of Newco Brazil, as the case may
be, immediately following the Closing Date.  In addition, effective as
of the Closing Date, each Asset Seller shall terminate the employment
of, and Buyer shall offer employment to employees of UK listed on
Schedule 5.18(g)(i).   (Persons described in the second preceding

          (b)  Buyer shall also take any necessary action so that each
employee benefit plan maintained by, or required to be contributed to
by, Brazil or UK for Foreign Affected Employees shall be continued
immediately following the Closing Date and all service recognized
under each such plan shall continue to be recognized after the Closing
Date.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, on

extent required by law by the provisions of each prior offer of
employment by Sellers to Foreign Affected Employees and by the
employment agreements, collective bargaining agreements, collective
employee agreements, customary practices and other employment-related
obligations applicable and relevant to Foreign Affected Employees, to
the extent required by local law or the provisions of those
agreements.  Nothing herein shall prevent Buyer from modifying the
Foreign Affected Employees' terms and conditions of employment or
establishing new terms and conditions of employment to the extent such
actions are permitted by local law and the provisions of such
agreements; provided, however, that Buyer shall be responsible for all
claims, obligations and liabilities of any kind arising out of changes
made by Buyer after the Closing Date to employment agreements,
collective bargaining agreements, collective employee agreements,
customary practices and other employment-related obligations
applicable and related to Foreign Affected Employees.

          (c)  To the extent that Buyer is not obligated by any prior
offer of employment, any agreement, any customary practice or
otherwise by law to provide a specific level of compensation or
employee benefits to any Foreign Affected Employee, Buyer shall, for a
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending no earlier than the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, take any action necessary so
that each such Foreign Affected Employee who continues to be employed
in the Business or otherwise by Buyer shall continue to receive a
level of employee benefits and base wages or salary that, in the
aggregate, is no less favorable to such employee than the level of
employee benefits and base wages or salary paid or provided by the
Companies to such Foreign Affected Employee on the date of this
Agreement.

          (d)  Buyer shall be solely liable and responsible for all
obligations and commitments incurred after the Closing Date relating
to Affected Employees and Foreign Affected Employees who become
employed by Buyer.

          (e)  Buyer and Sellers acknowledge that this Agreement
constitutes a relevant transfer of the whole of the Sellers'
undertaking relating to the Business for the purposes of the
Regulations.

          (f)  In accordance with the Regulations, the contract of
employment of each of the UK Employees shall be automatically
transferred to Buyer (or a designated Affiliate of Buyer) with effect
from the Closing Date.

          (g)  If any contract of employment of any employee other
than a UK Employee has effect as if originally made between Buyer and
the employee concerned as a result of the Regulations:

          (i)  Buyer may, upon becoming aware of any such contract,
       terminate it forthwith; and

           (ii)  Sellers shall indemnify and keep indemnified Buyer
       against any costs, claims, liabilities and expenses of any
       nature arising out of such termination and against sums payable
       to or on behalf of such employee in respect of his employment
       whether arising before or after the Closing Date.

          (h)  Except as provided for in the Valuation Date Statement,
Sellers shall be responsible for all emoluments and outgoings in
respect of the UK Employees (including without limitation all wages,
bonuses, commissions, PAYE, national insurance contributions, pension
contributions and otherwise) prior to the Closing Date and shall
indemnify and keep indemnified Buyer (or a designated Affiliate of
Buyer) against all liabilities, claims, demands and expenses in
respect of the same.

          (i)  Buyer shall be responsible for all emoluments and
outgoings in respect of the UK Employees (including without limitation
all wages, bonuses, commissions, PAYE, national insurance
contributions, pension contributions and otherwise) on and after the
Closing Date and shall indemnify and keep indemnified Sellers against
all liabilities, claims, demands and expenses in respect of the same.

          Section 8.5.  Securities Law Legends.  Buyer agrees and
                        ----------------------
understands that the Newco Brazil Shares have not been, and will not
be, registered under the securities laws of any state or country and
that the Newco Brazil Shares may be sold or disposed of only in one or
more transactions registered under applicable securities laws or as to
which an exemption from the registration requirements of applicable
securities laws is available.  Buyer acknowledges and agrees that no
person has any right to require Sellers to cause the registration of
any of the Newco Brazil Shares.  The certificates representing the
Newco Brazil Shares shall contain a legend to such effect.

          Section 8.6.  Insurance; Risk of Loss.  Each Asset Seller
                        -----------------------
will, and Sellers will cause Viskase Brazil and Newco Brazil to, keep
insurance policies currently maintained by the Companies covering
their respective businesses, assets and current or former employees,
as the case may be, or suitable replacements therefor, in full force
and effect through the close of business on the Closing Date, and
Buyer shall become solely responsible for all insurance coverage and
related risk of loss based on events occurring after the Closing Date
with respect to the Business, the Purchased Assets and the Affected
Employees.  To the extent that after the Closing any party hereto
requires any information regarding claim data, payroll or other
information in order to make filing with insurance carriers or self
insurance regulators from another party hereto, the other party or
parties will promptly supply such information.

          Section 8.7.  Collection; Post-Closing Remittances.   (a)
                        ------------------------------------
For a period of 180 days after the Closing Date (the "Collection
                                                      ----------
Period"), at no cost to Sellers, Buyer shall use its commercially
------
reasonable efforts to collect the accounts and notes receivable of UK,
Ireland, Viskase Brazil and Chile (the "Receivables") generally in

                                        -----------
accordance with the billing and collection practices presently applied
by such Companies in the collection of their accounts and notes
receivable, except that with respect to any particular Receivable,
Buyer shall be under no obligation to commence or not to commence
litigation to effect collection.  Buyer shall use at least the same
standard of care for the collection of the Receivables that it uses in
its own business.  In connection with the collections by Buyer, if a
payment is received from an account debtor who has not designated the
invoice being paid thereby, Buyer shall contact such account debtor to
determine the invoice being paid thereby and, if no invoice is
designated, then such payment shall be applied to a Receivable
relating to a sale prior to the Closing Date.  Buyer agrees not to
knowingly take actions that are reasonably likely to diminish the
collectibility of the Receivables.

          (b)  Buyer shall remit all cash collections from the
Receivables to a bank account designated by Sellers on a weekly basis
on each Tuesday during the Collection Period.

          (c)  Buyer shall, on a weekly basis on each Tuesday during
the Collection Period, deliver to Sellers a written report
("Collection Report") of the following information with respect to the
  -----------------
Receivables:

          (i)  The aggregate amount of the Receivables (and the number
       of accounts comprising such Receivables);

          (ii)  The amount of cash collections of the Receivables
       during the period relating to such Collection Report; and

          (iii)  Any material problems relating to the collection of
       Receivables.

          (d)  During the period that Buyer is collecting Receivables
on behalf of Sellers, Buyer shall have the right and authority to
endorse, without recourse, the name of Sellers on any check or other
evidences of indebtedness received by Buyer on account of any
Receivable and shall promptly remit the amount of such Receivable to
Sellers in accordance with this Section 8.7.  Without limiting the
                                ------------
foregoing provisions of this Section 8.7, if, at any other time after
                             -----------
the Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliates shall receive any remittance
from any account debtors with respect to any accounts or notes
receivables included in the Excluded Assets, then Buyer or its
Affiliates, as applicable, shall endorse such remittance to the order
of the appropriate Seller and forward it to such Seller promptly
following receipt thereof.

including providing reasonable access to facilities for inspections or
obtaining information, reasonable access to documents for production
or use in the litigation, and/or reasonable access to employees and

reasonable assistance with the conduct of the litigation.  Following
assignment of the Licensed Patents to Buyer, Seller agrees to provide
the same assistance to Buyer in connection with the Newsome
Litigation.  The obligation to provide assistance pursuant to this
Section 8.8 shall continue notwithstanding any termination of the
-----------
Licensed Patents License Agreement.

          (b)  For a period of two (2) years following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall make available to Sellers former employees of
Sellers identified on Schedule 8.8 for consultation in connection with

mutually agreed to by the parties and shall not unreasonably interfere
with the principal duties of such employees.

          (c)  Sellers shall provide to Buyer and its representatives
and agents reasonable access to Seller's facilities, records and
documents and employees and officers, as reasonably requested by Buyer
from time to time in connection with any Assumed Liabilities,

has provided access to such confidential information.

          (e)  Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, will provide

Buyer, as the case may be, will reimburse such other party for any
reasonable direct out-of-pocket expenses (including 130% of any per
diem salary) incurred by such other party pursuant to this Section
                                                           -------

no claims shall be made by any Buyer Group Member under
Section 11.1(a) thereafter), except that the indemnification by

       the date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in
       accordance with this Section 11.1, as to which the obligation
                            -------------
       of Sellers shall continue solely with respect to the specific
       matters in such Claim Notice until the liability of Sellers
       shall have been determined pursuant to this Article XI, and

                                                   ----------
       Sellers shall have reimbursed all Buyer Group Members for the
       full amount of such Losses and Expenses that are payable with
       respect to such Claim Notice in accordance with this Article

          Section 11.2.  Indemnification by Buyer.  (a)  Buyer agrees
                         -------------------------
to indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Group Member from and

       representation of Buyer contained or referred to in this
       Agreement or the certificate delivered by or on behalf of Buyer
       pursuant to Section 10.1;
                   ------------

          (ii)  any breach by Buyer of, or failure by Buyer to
       perform, any of its covenants and obligations contained in this
       Agreement;

          (iii)  the conduct of the Business following the Closing
       Date; or

be made by any Seller Group Member under Section 11.2(a) thereafter),
                                         ---------------
except that the indemnification by Buyer shall continue as to:

          (i)  the obligations of Buyer with respect to Sections
                                                        --------
       11.2(a)(iii) and (iv) as to which no time limitation shall

                                                    ------------
       shall survive for the period of time set forth therein;

           (iii)  the covenants of Buyer set forth in Section 7.7 and

       Article VIII, which shall survive indefinitely; and

                                ------------
       such indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance
       with this Section 11.2, as to which the obligation of Buyer

                 ------------
       shall continue solely with respect to the specific matters in
       such Claim Notice until the liability of Buyer shall have been
       determined pursuant to this Article XI, and Buyer shall have
                                   ----------
       reimbursed all Seller Group Members for the full amount of such
       Losses and Expenses that are payable with respect to such Claim
       Notice in accordance with this Article XI.
                                      ----------

          Section 11.3.  Notice of Claims.  Any Buyer Group Member or
                         ----------------
Seller Group Member seeking indemnification hereunder (the
"Indemnified Party") shall give promptly to the party obligated to
 -----------------
provide indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the "Indemnitor") a
                                                        ----------
notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in reasonable detail the facts
           ------------
giving rise to the claim for indemnification hereunder and shall
include in such Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method
of computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or
instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which
such claim is based; provided, however, that a Claim Notice in respect
                     --------  -------
of any action at law or suit in equity by or against a third Person as
to which indemnification will be sought shall be given promptly after
the action or suit is commenced; provided, however, that failure to
                                 --------  -------
give notice as provided in this Section 11.3 shall not relieve the
                                ------------
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall
have been prejudiced by such failure.

          Section 11.4.  Determination of Amount.  (a)  In calculating
                         -----------------------
any Loss or Expense there shall be deducted any insurance recovery
(excluding recoveries to the extent they are self-insured) in respect
thereof (and no right of subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any
insurer).  Buyer and Sellers agree that, for purposes of computing the
amount of any indemnification payment under this Article XI, any such
                                                 ----------
indemnification payment shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.  Any such indemnification payment
hereunder with respect to any Loss or Expense shall be an amount which
is sufficient to compensate the Indemnified Party  for the amount of
such Loss or Expense, after taking into account (i) any Tax benefit
which has been, or will be, provided to such Indemnified Party as a
result of such Loss or Expense (such Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Tax benefit, including
filing amended Tax Returns if necessary) and (ii) all increases in
federal, state, local, foreign or other Taxes payable by the
Indemnified Party as a result of the receipt of such payment (by
reason of such payment being included in income, resulting in a
reduction of tax basis, or otherwise increasing such Taxes payable by
the Indemnified Party  at any time).

          (b)  After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant to
Section 11.3, the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified
------------
Party shall be entitled under this Article XI shall be determined: (i)
                                   ----------
by the written agreement between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnitor; (ii) by a final judgment or decree of any court of
competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree.  The judgment or
decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal, if
any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when
all appeals taken shall have been finally determined.  The Indemnified
Party shall have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of
Losses and Expenses suffered by it.

          Section 11.5.  Third Person Claims.  (a)  Any party seeking
                         -------------------
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of,
arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by any third Person
against the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnitor in writing,
and in reasonable detail, of the third Person claim within 10 days
after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the third
Person claim.  Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Indemnitor, within five business days after the Indemnified Party's
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnitor relating to the third Person claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, should a party be physically served
with a complaint with regard to a third Person claim, the Indemnified
Party shall notify the Indemnitor with a copy of the complaint within
five business days after receipt thereof and shall deliver to the
Indemnitor within seven business days after the receipt of such
complaint copies of notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party relating to the third Person claim.
The failure to give notice as provided in this Section 11.5 shall not
                                               ------------
relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the
extent it shall have been prejudiced by such failure.

          (b)  In the event any legal proceeding shall be threatened
in writing or instituted or any claim or demand shall be asserted in
writing by any Person in respect of which payment may be sought by one
party hereto from the other party under the provisions of this Article
                                                               -------
XI, the Indemnified Party shall promptly cause written notice of the
--
assertion of any such claim of which it has knowledge which is covered
by this indemnity to be forwarded to the Indemnitor.  Any notice of a
claim by reason of any of the representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement shall contain a reference to the provision
of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument
executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is
based, the facts giving rise to an alleged basis for the claim and the
amount of the liability asserted against the Indemnitor by reason of
the claim.  In the event of the initiation of any legal proceeding
against the Indemnified Party by a third Person, the Indemnitor shall
have the sole and absolute right after the receipt of notice, at its
option and at its own expense, to be represented by counsel of its
choice (reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party) and to
control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any loss, liability or
damage indemnified against hereunder; provided, however, that the
                                      --------  -------
Indemnified Party may participate in any such proceeding with counsel
of its choice and at its expense.  The parties hereto agree to
cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense,
negotiation or settlement of any such legal proceeding, claim or
demand.  To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to defend such
proceeding, claim or demand, and the Indemnified Party defends against
or otherwise deals with any such proceeding, claim or demand, the
Indemnified Party may retain counsel, at the expense of the
Indemnitor, and control the defense of such proceeding.  Neither the
Indemnitor nor the Indemnified Party may settle any such proceeding
which settlement obligates the other party to pay money, to perform
obligations or to admit liability without the consent of the other
party.  After any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by
a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of competent
jurisdiction and the time in which to appeal therefrom has expired, or
a settlement shall have been consummated, or the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnitor shall arrive at a mutually binding agreement with
respect to each separate matter alleged to be indemnified by the
Indemnitor hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the
Indemnitor notice of any sums due and owing by it with respect to such
matter and the Indemnitor shall pay all of the sums so owing to the
Indemnified Party by wire transfer, certified or bank cashier's check
within 30 days after the date of such notice.

          (c)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, Sellers shall have the exclusive right to assume the defense
of, or otherwise contest or settle any claim, action, suit,
investigation or proceeding which is an Excluded Liability.  Buyer
agrees to cooperate and assist Sellers with all reasonable requests
(including, without limitation, making employees available for
interviews, depositions and trials) and to afford Sellers access to
any records, reports or other documents reasonably requested by
Sellers in connection with such claims, actions, suits or proceedings.

          (d)  To the extent of any inconsistency between this Section
                                                               -------
11.5 and Section 8.2(c) (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of
----     -------------
Section 8.2(c) shall control with respect to Tax contests.
-------------
          Section 11.6.  Limitations.  (a)  In any case where an
                         -----------
Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any amount in respect of
a matter with respect to which an Indemnitor has indemnified it
pursuant to this Article XI, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay
                 ----------
over to the Indemnitor the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring
such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount
previously so paid by the Indemnitor to or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party in respect of such matter and (ii) any amount
expended by the Indemnitor in pursuing or defending any claim arising
out of such matter.

          (b)  Sellers shall not be required to indemnify and hold
harmless any Buyer Group Member pursuant to Section 11.1(a) to the
                                            ---------------
extent the matter in question was taken into account in the
computation of the Final Purchase Price pursuant to Section 3.2.
                                                    -----------

          (c)  In the event that Sellers are conducting any defense
against a third Person claim for which a Buyer Group Member has sought
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1(a) , expenses incurred by
                            ---------------
Sellers in connection therewith, including legal costs and expenses,
shall constitute Expenses for purposes of determining the maximum
aggregate amount to be paid by Sellers pursuant to Section 11.1(a).
                                                   ---------------

          (d)  No party shall have any liability for any inaccuracy in
or breach of any representation, warranty or agreement by such party
if the other party or any of its officers, employees, counsel or other
representatives had actual knowledge on or before the Closing Date of
the facts as a result of which such representation, warranty or
agreement was inaccurate or breached.

          (e)  Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter
of law and injunctive and provisional relief (including, but not
limited to, specific performance), if the Closing occurs, this Article
                                                               -------
XI shall be the exclusive remedy for breaches of this Agreement
--
(including any covenant, obligation, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement) or otherwise in respect of the sale of the
Purchased Assets contemplated hereby.  The parties agree that their
respective rights and obligations in respect of Environmental Matters
as provided in this Agreement shall supersede any such rights and
obligations they may have under any existing or future law.  Except
for any Losses or Expenses for which Sellers are required to indemnify
and hold harmless the Buyer Group members in accordance with Section
                                                             -------
11.1(a)(i), Buyer releases Sellers from any and all liability for
----------
Losses and Expenses relating to Environmental Matters arising in
connection with the Business or the Purchased Assets.

          (f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
Sellers shall have no indemnification obligations with respect to any
breach of any representation or warranty contained in Section 5.17 to
                                                      ------------
the extent that such breach was discovered or otherwise identified
through any voluntary investigation undertaken by Buyer or its
Affiliates, including any soil or groundwater sampling.  Sellers and
Buyer agree that any demand or request by any governmental agency or
court (or by any third party asserting a claim against Buyer or
alleging liability on the part of Buyer) for any investigation or
remediation of any property, including any soil or groundwater
sampling, shall be deemed to be an involuntary investigation and
therefore not governed by the provisions of the preceding sentence
unless initiated by a voluntary request or disclosure by Buyer.

          Section 11.7.  Mitigation.  Each of the parties agrees to
                         ----------
take all reasonable steps to mitigate their respective Losses and
Expenses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition which
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses and Expenses
that are indemnifiable hereunder; provided, however, that no party
                                  --------  -------
shall be obligated to expend money, commence or participate in any
litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any third party.

                                TERMINATION
                                -----------

          Section 12.1.  Termination.  Anything contained in this
                         -----------
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date:

          (a)  by the mutual consent of Buyer and Sellers;

          (b)  by Buyer in the event of any breach by Sellers of any
of Sellers' agreements, representations or warranties contained herein
which would result in a Material Adverse Effect and the failure of
Sellers to cure such breach within 30 days after receipt of notice
from Buyer requesting such breach to be cured;

          (c)  by Sellers in the event of any breach by Buyer of any
of Buyer's agreements, representations or warranties contained herein
which would have a material adverse effect on Buyer's ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and the failure of
Buyer to cure such breach within 30 days after receipt of notice from
Sellers requesting such breach to be cured;

          (d)  by Buyer or Sellers if any court of competent
jurisdiction in the United States or other United States Governmental
Body shall have issued a final and non-appealable order, decree or
ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; or

          (e)  by Buyer or Sellers if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before September 30, 2000 (or such later date as may be
agreed in writing to by Buyer and Sellers), unless the failure of such
consummation shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement to comply in all material respects with the
agreements and covenants contained herein to be performed by such
party on or before the Closing Date.

          Section 12.2.  Notice of Termination.  Any party desiring to
                         ---------------------
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1 shall give written
                                     ------------
notice of such termination to the other party to this Agreement.

          Section 12.3.  Effect of Termination.  In the event that
                         ---------------------
this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to this Article XII, all
                                                    -----------
further obligations of the parties under this Agreement (other than
Sections 12.4 and 13.10) shall be terminated without further liability
-------------     -----
of any party to the other; provided, however, that nothing herein
                           --------  -------
shall relieve any party from liability for its willful breach of this
Agreement.

          Section 12.4.  Non-Solicitation.  If this Agreement is
                         ----------------
terminated, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will, for a period
of two years thereafter, without the prior written approval of
Sellers, directly or indirectly solicit, induce or attempt to persuade
any person who is an employee of the Companies on the date hereof or
at any time hereafter that precedes such termination, to terminate his
or her employment with the Companies.  Without limiting the rights of
Sellers to pursue all other legal and equitable rights available for a
violation of this Section 12.4 by Buyer or its Affiliates, it is
                  ------------
agreed that other remedies cannot fully compensate Sellers for such a
violation and that Sellers shall be entitled to injunctive relief to
prevent a violation or continuing violation hereof.

                            ------------

          Section 13.1.  Survival of Representations and Warranties.
                         ------------------------------------------
All representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall
survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement through the period during which claims for indemnification
may be made for such representations and warranties pursuant to
Article XI (at which time such representations and warranties shall
----------
terminate).

          Section 13.2.  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be

States or another jurisdiction is mandatory.

          Section 13.3.  No Public Announcement.  Neither Buyer nor
                         ----------------------
Sellers shall, without the approval of the other, make any press
release or other public announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that any
such party shall be so obligated by law, in which case the other party
shall be advised and the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to
cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not preclude
--------  -------
communications or disclosures necessary to implement the provisions of
this Agreement or to comply with the accounting and the Securities and
Exchange Commission disclosure obligations or the rules of any stock
exchange; provided further, however, that the foregoing shall not

preclude conference calls or meetings with analysts and investors
following public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated

          Section 13.5.  Successors and Assigns.  (a)  The rights of
                         ----------------------
any party under this Agreement shall not be assignable by such party
hereto prior to the Closing without the written consent of the other
parties except that the rights of Buyer hereunder may be assigned in
whole or in part prior to the Closing, without the consent of Sellers,
to one or more corporations or limited liability companies all of the
outstanding capital stock or equity interests of which is owned or
controlled by Buyer; provided that (i) such assignment shall not
result in Buyer or Sellers having to amend their respective
Notification and Report Form filed under the HSR Act in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereunder, (ii) the assignee shall
assume in writing all of Buyer's obligations to Sellers hereunder in
proportion to the extent of such assignment by Buyer of its rights

obligations hereunder by reason of such assignment.

          (b)  Following the Closing, no party may assign any of its
rights hereunder to any third Person without the written consent of
the other parties, except that a party may assign its rights hereunder
to an Affiliate.  Any assignment hereunder (whether before or after
the Closing) shall not relieve the assigning party of its obligations
hereunder.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and permitted
assigns.  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended
or shall be construed to confer upon any Person other than the parties
and successors and assigns permitted by this Section 13.5 any right,
                                             ------------
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

          Section 13.6.  Access to Records after Closing.  (a)  For a
                         -------------------------------
period of six years after the Closing Date, Sellers and their
representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and
records of the Business to the extent that such access may reasonably
be required by Sellers in connection with matters relating to or
affected by the operations of the Business prior to the Closing Date.
Such access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours.  Sellers shall be
solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant
to this Section 13.6(a).  If Buyer or its Affiliates (including Newco
        ---------------
Brazil after the Closing) shall desire to dispose of any of such books
and records prior to the expiration of such six-year period, Buyer
shall, prior to such disposition, give Sellers a reasonable
opportunity, at Sellers' expense, to segregate and remove such books
and records as Sellers may select.

          (b)  For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyer
and its representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the
books and records relating to the Business which Sellers or any of
their Affiliates may retain after the Closing Date.  Such access shall
be afforded by Sellers and their Affiliates upon receipt of reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours.  Buyer shall be
solely responsible for any costs and expenses incurred by it pursuant
to this Section 13.6(b).  If Sellers or any of its Affiliates shall
        ---------------
desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the
expiration of such six-year period, Sellers shall, prior to such
disposition, give Buyer a reasonable opportunity, at Buyer's expense,
to segregate and remove such books and records as Buyer may select.

          Section 13.7.  Entire Agreement; Amendments.  This
                         ----------------------------
Agreement, the Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein, the
documents delivered pursuant hereto and the Confidentiality Agreement
contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with regard to
the subject matter contained herein or therein, and supersede all
other prior representations, warranties, agreements, understandings or
letters of intent between or among any of the parties hereto.  This
Agreement shall not be amended, modified or supplemented except by a
written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each of
the parties hereto.

          Section 13.8.  Interpretation.  Articles, titles and
                         --------------
headings to sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference
only and are not intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.  The Schedules and Exhibits referred
to herein shall be construed with and as an integral part of this
Agreement to the same extent as if they were set forth verbatim
herein.  The Schedules referred to herein are attached to that certain
letter of even date herewith from Sellers to Buyer (the "Disclosure
                                                         ----------
Letter").  Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule hereto
------
referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed
to have been disclosed with respect to every other section in this
Agreement if a reasonable person would reasonably ascertain that such
disclosure should reasonably apply to other sections in this
Agreement.  Neither the specification of any dollar amount in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to
imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item so
included or other items, are or are not material, and no party shall
use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion
of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as
to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
included in any Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.  Unless this Agreement specifically provides otherwise,
neither the specification of any item or matter in any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any
specific item in any Schedule hereto is intended to imply that such
item or matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the
ordinary course of business, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting forth or the inclusion of any such item or matter in any
dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in any
Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business for purposes
of this Agreement.  Sellers may, from time to time prior to or at the
Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
supplement, amend or create any Schedule, in order to add information
or correct previously supplied information.  No such amendment shall
be evidence, in and of itself, that the representations and warranties
in the corresponding section are no longer true and correct in all
material respects.  It is specifically agreed that such Schedules may
be amended to add immaterial, as well as material, items thereto.  No
such supplemental, amended or additional Schedule shall be deemed to
cure any breach for purposes of Section 9.1, unless Buyer does not
                                -----------
object to such supplemental, amended or additional Schedule within
five business days after receipt thereof.  If, however, the Closing
occurs, any such supplement, amendment or addition will be effective
to cure and correct for all other purposes any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant which would have existed if
Sellers had not made such supplement, amendment or addition, and all
references to any Schedule hereto which is supplemented or amended as
provided in this Section 13.8 shall for all purposes after the Closing
                 ------------
be deemed to be a reference to such Schedule as so supplemented or
amended.

          Section 13.9.  Waivers.  Any term or provision of this
                         -------
Agreement may be waived, or the time for its performance may be
extended, by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof.
Any such waiver shall be validly and sufficiently authorized for the
purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party, it is authorized in
writing by an authorized representative of such party.  The failure of
any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor
in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof
or the right of any party thereafter to enforce each and every such
provision.  No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to
constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

          Section 13.10.  Expenses.  Except as expressly set forth
                          --------
herein, each party hereto will pay all costs and expenses incident to
its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to its
performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions
contained herein on its part to be performed or complied with,
including the fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel and
independent public accountants.

          Section 13.11.  Partial Invalidity.  Wherever possible, each
                          ------------------
provision hereof shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but in case any one or more
of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision
shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the extent, of such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without invalidating the
remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction
would be unreasonable.

          Section 13.12.  Execution in Counterparts.  This Agreement
                          -------------------------
may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be
considered an original instrument, but all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement, and shall become binding when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to Sellers and Buyer.

          Section 13.13.  Further Assurances.  On and after the
                          ------------------
Closing Date each party hereto shall take such other actions and
execute such other documents and instruments of conveyance and
transfer as may be reasonably requested by the other party hereto from
time to time to effectuate or confirm the transfer of the Purchased
Assets to Buyer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any license,
certificate, approval, authorization, agreement, contract, lease,
easement or other commitment included in the Purchased Assets if an
attempted assignment thereof without the consent of a third party
thereto would constitute a breach thereof giving the third party a
right of termination.  If any such consent shall not be obtained or if
any attempted assignment would be ineffective or would impair Buyer's
rights under the Purchased Asset in question so that Buyer would not
in effect acquire the benefit of all such rights, Sellers, to the
maximum extent permitted by law and the Purchased Asset (but excluding
any obligation of Sellers to offer or pay any consideration therefor),
shall act after the Closing Date as Buyer's agent in order to obtain
for it the benefits thereunder.  Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate, to
the maximum extent permitted by law and the Purchased Asset (but
excluding any obligation of Sellers to offer or pay any consideration
therefor), with each other in any legal and reasonable arrangement
designed to provide such benefits to Buyer and to relieve Sellers from
any obligation, liability or burden associated therewith.

          Section 13.14.  Disclaimer of Warranties.  Sellers make no
                          ------------------------
representations or warranties with respect to any projections,
forecasts or forward-looking information provided to Buyer.  There is
no assurance that any projected or forecasted results will be
achieved.  EXCEPT AS TO THOSE MATTERS EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE CERTIFICATE
DELIVERED BY SELLERS PURSUANT TO SECTION 4.4(d), SELLERS ARE SELLING
                                 --------------
THE SHARES (AND THE BUSINESS AND ASSETS OF THE COMPANIES REPRESENTED
THEREBY) AND THE OTHER PURCHASED ASSETS ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS
AND SELLERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND
GUARANTIES WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  EXCEPT AS TO THOSE MATTERS
EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE CERTIFICATE DELIVERED BY SELLERS PURSUANT TO SECTION
                                                               -------
4.4(d), SELLERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO
------
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED
WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER.  Buyer acknowledges that neither Sellers nor
any of its representatives or any other Person has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any memoranda, charts or summaries heretofore made
available by Sellers or their representatives to Buyer or any other
information which is not included in this Agreement or the Schedules
hereto, and neither Sellers nor any of its representatives or any
other Person will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer, any
Affiliate of Buyer or any other Person resulting from the distribution
of any such information to, or use of any such information by, Buyer,
any Affiliate of Buyer or any of their agents, consultants,
accountants, counsel or other representatives.
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement
to be executed as of the day and year first above written.
