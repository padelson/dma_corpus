Except as provided below, such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior

effect of distorting the allocation of income or expense between Pre-Closing Tax Periods and
periods ending after the Closing Date or the portion, beginning after the Closing Date, of any

excess loss account taken into income under Treasury Regulation

each Company to join in DLH&#146;s consolidated federal Tax Return and, in jurisdictions requiring
separate reporting from DLH, to file separate Company state, local and foreign Tax Returns, and to
pay any and all Tax attributable to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Purchaser shall cause each Company
to file income Tax Returns (or shall include the Companies in its combined or consolidated income
Tax Return) for all Post-Closing Tax Periods, and shall pay any and all Taxes attributable to all

Tax Period that could reasonably be expected to result in any Tax liability for any Company or
Purchaser or require any of the foregoing to take any adverse Tax position without the prior
written consent of Purchaser. For purposes of this Agreement, the amount of taxable income of the
Companies attributable to the Straddle Period shall be determined based upon a hypothetical closing
of the taxable year on the Closing Date with the Closing Date being included in the pre-Closing

which are sufficiently disparate and several such that continued representation by one counsel (or

liability in connection with such Third Party Claim, which releases the Indemnified Party
completely in connection with such Third Party Claim and that would not otherwise adversely affect
the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled

counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such Third Party Claim) if the Third Party
Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages
against the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after conferring
with its outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages. If such
equitable relief or other relief portion of the Third Party Claim can be so separated from that for
money damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion
relating to money damages.

sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of
such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The failure by any Indemnified
Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party under Section&nbsp;9.1 or 9.2 hereof, except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by such
failure. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate
