 (g) As of the Closing, DLH and Duquesne Light Company shall, to the extent it does not violate the CodeÂ’s non-discrimination rules, take all necessary action to cause the defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans maintained by DLH and Duquesne Light Company to fully vest the Company Employees in their account balances and/or accrued benefits under such plans as of the Closing Date. 

   

 (h) With respect to each Company Employee (including any beneficiary or the dependent thereof), Seller shall retain all liabilities and obligations arising under any applicable welfare benefit plans of Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Companies) to the extent that such liability or obligation relates to claims incurred (whether or not reported or paid) prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 8.9(h), a claim shall be deemed to be incurred when (i) with respect to medical, dental, health related benefits, accident and disability (including workmenÂ’s compensation benefits), the medical, dental, health related, accident or disability services giving rise to such claim are performed and (ii) with respect to life insurance, when the death occurs. Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall be responsible for providing coverage under COBRA to any Company Employee, his or her spouse or dependent person as to whom a "qualifying event" as defined in Section 4890B of the Code has occurred prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (i) If a plant closing or a mass layoff occurs or is deemed to occur with respect to any Company at any time on or after the Closing, Purchaser shall be solely responsible for providing all notices required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. Â§ 2109 et seq. or the regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _WARN Act_ ") and for taking all remedial measures, including, without limitation, the payment of all amounts, penalties, liabilities, costs and expenses if such notices are not provided. 

   

 (j) Seller shall retain any and all liabilities and obligations which relate to service of any Company Employee prior to the Closing Date and arise under any Seller Employee Plans that provide for postretirement benefits for periods of service prior to the Closing Date with respect to any Company Employee employed by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Companies) that are (A) defined benefit pension plans subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (B) defined contribution plans as defined in Section 3(34) of ERISA, (C) voluntary employeesÂ’ beneficiary associations under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, or (D) related to other post-employment benefits for all current retirees of the Companies as of the Closing. 

   

 (k) Approximately two weeks prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide to Purchaser a list of the Annual Incentive Plan prorated payments, if any, for each proposed Company Employee as of the Closing Date, calculated on the basis of a full payout for any applicable open Annual Incentive Plan year (the " _Prorated Payment_ "). Purchaser shall (i) on the 

      ##### 

  

    

Closing Date, cause the applicable Company to pay to each Company Employee the
respective Prorated Payment, if any, and (ii) cause the applicable Company to
pay to each Company Employee a prorated amount under PurchaserÂ’s
corresponding incentive plan, if any, for the period from the Closing
Date until December 31 of the year in which Closing occurs. 

   

 8.10 _Further Assurances_. After the Closing, each Party shall cooperate with the other, and execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such other instruments, including instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer, and use commercially reasonable efforts to take all such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the other Party from time to time, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, to effectuate the purposes and provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 8.11 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) Seller shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of the CompaniesÂ’ federal (if applicable), state and local income and, if appropriate, other Tax Returns with respect to all periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion, ending on or before the Closing Date, of any Straddle Period (" _Pre-Closing Tax Periods_ "), and for the payment of all federal, state and local income and, if appropriate, other Taxes with respect to all such Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Except as provided below, such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice, and shall utilize accounting methods, elections and conventions that do not have the effect of distorting the allocation of income or expense between Pre-Closing Tax Periods and periods ending after the Closing Date or the portion, beginning after the Closing Date, of any Straddle Period (" _Post-Closing Tax Periods_ "). Seller shall include the income of each Company (including any deferred item triggered into income by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-13 and any excess loss account taken into income under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-19) on DLHÂ’s consolidated federal Tax Returns for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and pay any and all Taxes attributable to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods. For all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, Seller shall cause each Company to join in DLHÂ’s consolidated federal Tax Return and, in jurisdictions requiring separate reporting from DLH, to file separate Company state, local and foreign Tax Returns, and to pay any and all Tax attributable to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods. Purchaser shall cause each Company to file income Tax Returns (or shall include the Companies in its combined or consolidated income Tax Return) for all Post-Closing Tax Periods, and shall pay any and all Taxes attributable to all Post-Closing Tax Periods. Seller agrees not take any position in any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period that could reasonably be expected to result in any Tax liability for any Company or Purchaser or require any of the foregoing to take any adverse Tax position without the prior written consent of Purchaser. For purposes of this Agreement, the amount of taxable income of the Companies attributable to the Straddle Period shall be determined based upon a hypothetical closing of the taxable year on the Closing Date with the Closing Date being included in the pre-Closing portion of such Straddle Period; provided, however, real and personal property Taxes (which are not based on income) shall be determined by reference to the relative number of days in the pre-Closing and post-Closing portions of such Straddle Period. 

   

 (b) Purchaser and Seller recognize that each of them will need access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax records and information held 

      ##### 

  

    

by Purchaser and/or the Companies to the extent such records and information
pertain to events occurring prior to the Closing Date; therefore, Purchaser
agrees to cause the Companies to (i) properly retain and maintain such
records for a period of seven years from the date the Tax Returns for the
year in which the Closing occurs are filed or until the expiration of the
statute of limitations with respect to such year, whichever is later, and
(ii) allow Seller and its agents and representatives at times and dates
mutually acceptable to the Parties, to reasonably inspect, review and make
copies of such records from time to time, such activities to be conducted
during normal business hours and at SellerÂ’s expense. 

   

 8.12 _Fresh Kills Project_. After the Closing and until July 1, 2007, (a) Purchaser shall cause GSF Energy, LLC to maintain in full force and effect that certain $1,000,000 Payment Bond dated December _29,_ 2003 made by GSF Energy, LLC and Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland in favor of The City of New York (the " _GSF Payment Bond_ "): and (b) Seller shall cause to be maintained in full force and effect that certain $3,500,000 Letter of Credit issued by Citibank, N.A. in favor of The City of New York, as amended (the " _GSF Letter of Credit_ "). 

  

 8.13 _Transition Services_. Seller shall provide, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to provide, to Purchaser and the Companies, for a period of up to six months after the Closing Date, certain corporate support and administrative services with respect to the Business and the Companies, pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement to be entered into at the Closing, substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto, which agreement shall set forth the fees payable by Purchaser in connection therewith. 

  

 8.14  _Divestiture of Montauk Svnfuels, LLC_. Prior to the Closing, Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall cause Montauk to transfer all of MontaukÂ’s ownership interests in Montauk Synfuels, LLC to Seller, and shall take such other actions, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, such that on the Closing Date, neither Montauk nor any other Company shall have (i) any direct or indirect ownership interest in any of the Synfuels Entities or (ii) any Liability or other future obligation of any nature whatsoever to, or in any way related to, the Synfuels Entities or their Affiliates (collectively, the " _Synfuels Divestiture_ "). Seller shall provide to Purchaser copies of all documents, agreements and other instruments executed by any of the Companies in connection with the Synfuels Divestiture. 

  

 8.15  _Surety Bonds_. Seller represents and warrants that attached as _Schedule 8.15_ hereto is a correct and complete list of surety and other bonds currently in place for the benefit of the Companies (collectively, the " _Bonds_ "). The Bonds have been obtained by or through Seller and/or DLH, and, as a result, Seller and/or DLH have reimbursement obligations if payments are made or expenses are incurred under the Bonds. _Schedule 8.15_ hereto identifies those Bonds which Purchaser has agreed to replace after the Closing (collectively, the " _Purchaser Replaced Bonds_ ") and those Bonds which Seller has agreed to cause to remain in place after the Closing (collectively, the " _Seller Retained Bonds_ "). Purchaser shall, at its expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to replace the Purchaser Replaced Bonds at the Closing or as soon thereafter as possible, including obtaining any third party consents required in connection with such replacements. Seller shall, at its expense, (i) cause the Purchaser Replaced Bonds to remain in place after the Closing until such time as Purchaser replaces such Bonds (but in no event later than 90 days after the Closing Date) and (ii) cause the Seller Retained Bonds to remain in place 

   ##### 

   

 

after the Closing for the period set forth for each such Bond on _Schedule
8.15_ hereto. Notwithstanding which Party is obligated to replace, retain or
maintain the Bonds as provided in this Section, (a) Seller shall be
responsible for, and shall reimburse Purchaser for, all Losses incurred in
connection with the Bonds with respect to any action, inaction or event which
occurs prior to the Closing and (b) Purchaser shall be responsible for, and
shall reimburse Seller for, all Losses incurred in connection with the
Purchaser Replaced Bonds with respect to any action, inaction or event which
occurs after the Closing. 

   

 8.16 _Restrictive Covenants_. To assure that Purchaser will realize the value and goodwill inherent in the Companies, Seller hereby agrees that, for a period of two years after the Closing Date: 

  

 (a) Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, as a stockholder (except as a stockholder owning beneficially or of record less than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of publicly traded stock of any issuer), or as a member, partner, joint venturer, proprietor or otherwise, own or operate a landfill gas-to-energy business; and 

   

 (b) Seller shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, employ or cause to be employed any Company Employee, unless such Company Employee is no longer employed by Purchaser or the Companies through no fault of Seller or its Affiliates. 

  

Seller agrees and acknowledges that the restrictions contained in this Section
are reasonable in scope and duration and are necessary to protect Purchaser
after the Closing. If, however, any provision of this Section, as applied to
any Party or to any circumstances, is adjudged by a court to be invalid or
unenforceable, the same will in no way affect any other provision of this
Section or any other part of this Agreement, the application of such
provision in any other circumstances or the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement. If any such provision, or any part thereof, is held to be
unenforceable because of the duration of such provision or the area covered
thereby, the Parties agree that the court making such determination will have
the power to reduce the duration and/or area of such provision, and/or to
delete specific words or phrases, and in its reduced form such provision will
then be enforceable and will be enforced. Upon breach of any provisions of
this Section, Purchaser will be entitled to injunctive relief, since the
remedy at law would be inadequate and insufficient. 

   

 8.17 _Bifurcation of Transaction_. The Parties acknowledge that they desire to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on or prior to December 31, 2006. In the event that as of December 28, 2006, the Required Statutory Approval of FERC has not been obtained and become a Final Order, then the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to bifurcate the transactions contemplated hereby such that (i) all of the shares of stock of Monmouth Energy, Inc. are transferred from Montauk to Seller prior to the Closing; (ii) the sale of Montauk to Purchaser is consummated on or prior to December 31, 2006; and (iii) the sale of Monmouth Energy, Inc. to Purchaser is consummated within five Business Days after the Required Statutory Approval of FERC has been obtained and become a Final Order. In connection with such bifurcation, if any, the Parties shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement and/or a new agreement relating thereto, each in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each Party. 

   ##### 

   

  

 8.18 _Release_. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller prior to the Closing the release of John Schmitt as required under Section 7.2(g) hereof.

 (d) the matters described on _Schedule 4.14_ hereto (collectively, the _"Existing Litigation_ ");

 (g) any Liabilities or payments required under any self-insurance arrangement of any of the Companies for Liabilities arising prior to the Closing Date, including without limitation all self-insurance obligations which have not been specifically accrued or reserved for as reflected in the Financial Statements; 

   

 (h) any Liabilities arising out of or relating to (i) the matters described on _Schedule 4.20_ hereto or (ii) "superfund" obligations existing as of the Closing of GSF Energy, LLC for the Omega Chemical Superfund site; or 

    ##### 

  

     

 (i) any Liabilities arising out of or related to (i) violations of Environmental Laws and/or related Permits prior to the Closing, (ii) "superfund" obligations of the Companies that result from the disposal of Hazardous Wastes prior to the Closing or (iii) any failure prior to the Closing on the part of Seller or the Companies to comply with all applicable Environmental Laws and/or related Permits in connection with the Monmouth facility in New Jersey, including without limitation all outstanding enforcement actions pending before the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. 

   

 9.2 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the remainder of this Article IX, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and its Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") against, and hold them harmless from, any and all Losses suffered or sustained by any Seller Indemnified Party and arising from, in connection with or otherwise with respect to:

 (d) any Liabilities arising out of or related to (i) violations of Environmental Laws and/or related Permits after the Closing, (ii) "superfund" obligations of the Companies that result from the disposal of Hazardous Wastes after the Closing or (iii) any failure after the Closing on the part of Purchaser or the Companies to comply with all applicable Environmental Laws and/or related Permits in connection with the Monmouth facility in New Jersey. 

   

 9.3 _Calculation of Losses: Limitations_. 

  

 (a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this Article IX shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to such Loss and net of amounts accrued on the CompaniesÂ’ balance sheet as of the Closing Date and included in Closing Working Capital with respect to such Loss, and shall be (i) increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss. In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income, gain, loss deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Loss. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article IX, but subject to Section 9.3(d) hereof, neither Party shall have any obligation to indemnify the other Party for 

      ##### 

  

    

Losses described under Section 9.1 (a) or Section 9.2(a) hereof until such
other Party shall incur, in the aggregate, Losses described under Section 9.1
(a) or Section 9.2(a) hereof, as applicable, in excess of $250,000, and then
only for Losses in excess of such amount. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article IX, but subject to Section 9.3(d) hereof, neither Party shall have any obligation to indemnify the other Party for Losses described under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 hereof in excess of $11,700,000. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations set forth in Sections 9.3(b) and 9.3(c) hereof shall not limit any recovery for Losses suffered or sustained (i) by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.1(c), 9.1 (d), 9.1(f) or 9.1(h) hereof or as a result of a breach of Section 3.2, 4.2 or 4.3 hereof; (ii) by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in any case based on fraud or intentional or willful misconduct by Seller, DLH or the Companies (prior to the Closing); (iii) by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.1(e), 9.1(g) or 9.1(i) hereof or as a result of a breach of Section 4.13, 4.15 or 4.20 hereof (provided, however, that Seller shall not be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any Losses suffered or sustained as described in this clause (iii), together with all other Losses suffered or sustained by them, in excess of $20,000,000); (iv) by the Seller Indemnified Parties in any case based on fraud or intentional or willful misconduct by Purchaser; (v) by the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 9.2(c) or 9.2(d) hereof (provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be obligated to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for any Losses suffered or sustained as described in this clause (v), together with all other Losses suffered or sustained by them, in excess of $20,000,000); or (vi) by the Seller Indemnified Parties as a result of a breach of Section 5.2. 

   

 9.4 _Indemnification Procedures_. 

  

 (a) In order for a Purchaser Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party (in such capacity, the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any Person against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must notify the Party from which indemnification is sought (in such capacity, the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of the Third Party Claim promptly following receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly following the Indemnified PartyÂ’s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim and not also addressed to the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party; provided that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party. In the event the Indemnifying Party duly elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not 

     ##### 

  

    

be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof
unless (i) the Indemnifying Party has failed to promptly assume the defense
of a Third Party Claim after receipt of notice of the commencement thereof or
(ii) there are defenses available to the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party which are sufficiently disparate and several such that
continued representation by one counsel (or legal firm) of both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party would materially prejudice
the assertion or prosecution of such defenses or otherwise result in a
conflict of interest for such counsel. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such
defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from
the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. If the Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying
PartyÂ’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement,
compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party
may recommend and that by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay
the full amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim,
which releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection with such Third
Party Claim and that would not otherwise adversely affect the Indemnified
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable
for the fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in
defending such Third Party Claim) if the Third Party Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money
damages against the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably
determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated
from any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief or other
relief portion of the Third Party Claim can be so separated from that
for money damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the
defense of the portion relating to money damages. 

   

 (c) In the event any Indemnified Party has a claim against an Indemnifying Party under Section 9.1 or 9.2 hereof that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to such Indemnified Party under Section 9.1 or 9.2 hereof, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction. 

    ##### 

   

     

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall assume and control the defense of the Existing Litigation. 

   

 9.5 _Exclusive Post-Closing Remedy_. The remedies set forth in this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties after the Closing for any and all Losses sustained or incurred by the Parties or their respective successors or assigns in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 9.6 _Termination of Indemnification Obligations_. The indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 9.1 and Section 9.2 hereof with respect to (i) representations and warranties set forth herein shall terminate at the end of the applicable survival period set forth in Section 11.3 hereof, (ii) covenants set forth herein shall terminate on the date which is 18 months after the Closing Date (or such later time as may be expressly set forth in such covenant), (iii) the items described in Sections 9.1(e), 9.1(f) and 9.2(c) hereof shall terminate upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and (iv) the items described in Sections 9.1(i) and 9.2(d) hereof shall terminate on the third anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however, that such indemnification obligations shall not terminate with respect to (a) any item as to which the Indemnified Party shall have, before the expiration of such period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim) to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with Section 9.4 hereof; and (b) the items described in Section 9.1(c), 9.1 (d), 9.1(g) or 9.1(h) hereof. 

  

ARTICLE X

 10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated: 

  

 (a) By Seller upon written notice to Purchaser if Seller is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and (i) there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of Purchaser in a manner causing the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 hereof not to be satisfied and such breach shall not have been cured in all material respects within 30 days of receipt by Purchaser of written notice of such breach or (ii) Purchaser fails to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date if all conditions set forth in Section 7.1 hereof have been satisfied or waived as of such date; 

   

 (b) By Purchaser upon written notice to Seller if Purchaser is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement and (i) there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of Seller in a manner causing the conditions, set forth in Section 7.1 hereof not to be satisfied and such breach shall not have been cured in all material respects within 30 days of receipt by Seller of written notice of such breach or (ii) Seller fails to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date if all conditions set forth in Section 7.2 hereof have been satisfied or waived as of such date; 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) By either Party if the Closing Date has not occurred on or before February 28, 2007, for reasons other than the failure of the Party seeking termination to comply in full with its obligations under this Agreement; or 

   

 (d) By mutual consent of the Parties. 

   

 10.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this Agreement by Seller pursuant to Section 10.1 (a) hereof or by Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.1 (b) hereof, the Parties shall be entitled to pursue all remedies as may be available to them at law or in equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the termination of this Agreement by Seller pursuant to Section 10.1 (a) hereof, Seller shall be entitled to pursue any and all Losses suffered by it in connection with such termination. In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1 (c) or Section 10.1 (d) hereof, neither Party shall have any liability to the other Party as a result of such termination. 

  

 10.3 _Pre-Closing Remedies_. In addition to the remedies available at law, each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the other Party would be irreparably harmed in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached prior to the Closing. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that, in addition to any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled at law or in equity, they each shall be entitled to equitable remedies, including injunctive relief and/or specific performance, to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof.

  _Miscellaneous_  

   

 11.1 _Waivers and Amendments_. Any amendment or modification to this Agreement or the rights of either Party shall be made only by a written agreement signed by both Parties. 

  

 11.2 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to principles of choice of law. 

  

 11.3 _Survival_.

   ##### 

   

  

 11.5 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns, and nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any other Person any legal or equitable rights hereunder, except that the employees of the Companies on the Closing Date and the Additional Employees are intended third party beneficiaries, and shall have third party beneficiary rights, under Section 8.9 hereof.
