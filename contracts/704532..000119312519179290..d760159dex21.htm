exchange therefor.

share of Merger Sub common stock, par value $0.01 per share, issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Adjustment_. The Exchange Ratio and the Fractional Share
Consideration and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be,
will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of

Rudolph Common Stock, as applicable), reorganization, recapitalization,

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Nanometrics will
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Rudolph to act as

Nanometrics Common Stock (whether represented in certificated or non-
certificated direct registration form) to issue the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration and (ii) cash sufficient to make payments of Fractional Share
Consideration. All such cash and shares of Nanometrics Common Stock that are
deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_, are referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_." Nanometrics will cause the Exchange Agent to make delivery
of the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund will be for the sole benefit of the holders of
shares of Rudolph Common Stock. Nanometrics will cause the Exchange Agent not
to use the Exchange Fund for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in
this Agreement.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Nanometrics will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the

pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof together with the posting of any bond required by the Exchange Agent

Consideration into which such shares of Rudolph Common Stock have been
converted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, together with any Fractional Share
Consideration payable in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Nanometrics Common Stock in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof together with the posting of any bond
required by the Exchange Agent in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_) or

be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_ for each share of Rudolph Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed within ten business days
following the later to occur of (x) the Effective Time or (y) the Exchange

affidavits of loss in lieu thereof together with the posting of any bond
required by the Exchange Agent in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_)
or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent or Nanometrics may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it will be a
condition precedent of payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered will be
properly endorsed or will be otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B)
the Person requesting such payment has paid any transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or has
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax

Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares will only be made to
the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as

Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Rudolph

for any reason, they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following
the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Nanometrics will be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that has not been

such holders will be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation and
Nanometrics (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger
Consideration, payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_, without

be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Nanometrics and the Exchange Agent),

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Rudolph Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Rudolph Equity Plans_. As of the Effective Time, the Rudolph Equity
Plans will be assumed by Nanometrics. In addition, as of the Effective Time,
Nanometrics will assume all the obligations of Rudolph under the Rudolph
Equity Plans and the agreements evidencing Rudolph Stock Options and Rudolph

(b) _Rudolph Stock Options_.

 

(1) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding stock option to purchase
Rudolph Common Stock (each, a " _Rudolph Stock Option_ ") granted to an

continue to have, and will be subject to, substantially the same terms and
conditions as applied to the applicable Rudolph Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including the term, exercisability and vesting

 Time, (1) the number of shares of Nanometrics Common Stock underlying each
such assumed Nanometrics Stock Option will be equal to the product of (A) the
number of shares of Rudolph Common Stock underlying the applicable Rudolph
Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number and (2) the per share
exercise price for the shares of Nanometrics Common Stock underlying each
such assumed Nanometrics Stock Option will be equal to the quotient of (x) the
exercise price per share at which such assumed Nanometrics Stock Option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (y) the
Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The exercise price and
the number of shares of Nanometrics Common Stock purchasable under each
assumed Nanometrics Stock Option shall be determined in a manner consistent
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and in a manner consistent
with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code in the case of Rudolph
Stock Options that qualify as "incentive stock options" pursuant to Section
422 of the Code as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(2) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding Rudolph Stock Option that
is not assumed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(1)_ will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the positive
difference, if any, calculated by subtracting the aggregate exercise price of
such Rudolph Stock Option from the product of (i) the aggregate number of
shares of Rudolph Common Stock subject to such Rudolph Stock Option and (ii)
the Merger Consideration Value (subject to any withholding required by
applicable Law). Following the Effective Time, any such cancelled Rudolph
Stock Option shall solely entitle the holder thereof to the payment described
in this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(2)_, which shall be made by the Surviving
Corporation or Nanometrics as of, or within five (5) business days following,
the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Rudolph RSU Awards_.

 

(1) As of the Effective Time, each outstanding award of restricted stock
units, including performance stock units, that corresponds to a number of
shares of Rudolph Common Stock (each, a " _Rudolph RSU Award_ ") that is not
then vested will be assumed by Nanometrics and converted into a restricted
stock unit award (or performance stock unit award, as the case may be)
corresponding to shares of Nanometrics Common Stock (each, a " _Nanometrics
RSU Award_ "). Except as otherwise provided in this _Section_ __ _
2.3(c)(1)_, each assumed and converted Nanometrics RSU Award will continue to
have, and will be subject to, substantially the same terms and conditions as
applied to the applicable Rudolph RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including the vesting and settlement schedule(s) as were applicable to
the corresponding Rudolph RSU Award immediately before the Effective Time and
taking into account any applicable provisions regarding pre-Effective Time
determination of performance, conversion of such awards to time-based awards,
and forfeiture of awards that did not satisfy the performance requirements).
As of the Effective Time, the number of shares of Nanometrics Common Stock
subject to each such assumed Nanometrics RSU Award will be equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Rudolph Common Stock subject to the
applicable Rudolph RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
_multiplied by_ (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up or down to the nearest
whole share.

(2) Any share of Rudolph Common Stock underlying a Rudolph RSU Award
that is not assumed pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(1), but as to which such
underlying share of Rudolph Common Stock has not been issued by the Effective
Time, will, after taking into account any reduction in share numbers under the
application of performance-based awards, be issued as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and will be treated as a share of Rudolph Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
Section 2.1 and shall be entitled to the Per Share Merger Consideration as
provided in, and subject to, _Section_ __ _ 2.1_.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Rudolph will pass resolutions and take all
such other steps as are necessary for the treatment of Rudolph Stock Options
and Rudolph RSU Awards (collectively, the " _Rudolph_

  _Equity Awards_ ") as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_. The
parties acknowledge that, unless otherwise agreed by the Rudolph service
provider, nothing in this Section 2.3 shall affect or modify the treatment of
Rudolph Equity Awards as otherwise contemplated by any existing agreement or
contract between Rudolph and such Rudolph service provider.

 

(e) Nanometrics will reserve for issuance the number of shares of
Nanometrics Common Stock that will become subject to the assumed Nanometrics
Stock Options and Nanometrics RSU Awards. As soon as practicable following the
Closing Date, Nanometrics will file an appropriate Registration Statement on
Form S-8 or other appropriate form with respect to the offering of the shares
of Nanometrics Common Stock issuable upon vesting of the assumed Nanometrics
Stock Options and Nanometrics RSU Awards (the " _S-8
Registration Statement_") and will use reasonable best efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of the S-8 Registration Statement thereafter for so long as
any of such Nanometrics Stock Options and Nanometrics RSU Awards remain
outstanding. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Nanometrics
will deliver to the holders of the assumed Nanometrics Stock Options and
Nanometrics RSU Awards appropriate notices setting forth the effect of the
Merger on such holders rights and describing the treatment of such awards in
accordance with this _Article II_.

 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, Rudolph will take all actions reasonably
necessary to (1) terminate the Rudolph ESPP as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (2) provide that any offering period that would otherwise
be in progress on the Closing Date under the Rudolph ESPP (the " _Rudolph ESPP
Offering Period_ ") will be shortened by setting a new exercise date no later
than the last payroll day prior to the Effective Time (the " _Final Purchase
Date_ "). Any shares of Rudolph Common Stock acquired under the Rudolph ESPP
prior to or on the Final Purchase Date will be treated as outstanding shares
of Rudolph Common Stock for purposes of Section 2.1. Rudolph will provide
written notice of the setting of the Final Purchase Date and termination of
the Rudolph ESPP at least ten (10) business days prior to the Final Purchase
Date, in accordance with the Rudolph ESPP.

(g) Rudolph and Nanometrics may mutually agree in writing to treat equity
compensation held by Rudolph employees subject to non-U.S. Law in another
manner to take into account applicable non-U.S. law or Tax or employment
considerations; provided that the Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure such treatment corresponds as closely as permitted by
applicable Law to treatment of equity compensation held by Rudolph employees
subject to U.S. Law.

Section 2.4 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each of the Nanometrics Entities, the Surviving Corporation, and
the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration or other amounts payable by it pursuant to this Agreement to any
Person such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted with respect
to such payments under the Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local
or foreign Tax Law, and to collect any necessary Tax forms, including
Forms W-8 or W-9, as applicable, or any similar information, from any
recipients of payments hereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 2.5 _Fractional Shares_.

 

(a) No certificates, receipts or scrip representing fractional shares of
Nanometrics Common Stock will be issued upon the surrender or transfer for
exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of
Nanometrics will relate to such fractional shares of Nanometrics Common Stock,
and such fractional shares of Nanometrics Common Stock will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Nanometrics. Each
Person who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of
Nanometrics Common Stock in connection with the Merger shall receive, in
lieu thereof, an amount in cash (without interest, rounded to the nearest
whole cent and subject to the amount of any withholding Taxes as contemplated
in _Section_ __ _ 2.4_)) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i)
the fraction of a share to which

 such Person would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing price for a
share of Nanometrics Common Stock on Nasdaq on the last complete trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

(b) Nanometrics shall pay to the Exchange Agent an amount in cash in United
States dollars, to be deposited promptly (and in any event within one (1)

to pay any cash payment required by this Section 2.5.

 Subsidiaries and its and their directors, officers, employees and other
Representatives to immediately cease, any and all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person (or provision of any information to any Person)
with respect to any Nanometrics Competing Proposal. For purposes of this

defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than, with respect to
Nanometrics, Rudolph or any Rudolph Subsidiaries. Nanometrics shall promptly
inform its Representatives of Nanometricss obligations under this _Section_
__ _ 5.3_ following the date of this Agreement. Nanometrics acknowledges and

may, (1) contact the Person that made such Nanometrics Competing Proposal to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions thereof and (2) if the
Nanometrics Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation
with Nanometricss outside legal counsel and Nanometricss nationally
recognized independent financial advisor that such Nanometrics Competing
Proposal constitutes a Nanometrics Superior Proposal or would reasonably be
expected to result in a Nanometrics Superior Proposal and that a failure to
take any such action with respect to such Nanometrics Competing Proposal would

than the date that is five (5) business days prior to the Outside Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, nothing in
this Agreement will relieve Rudolph of its obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 5.5(d)_, including its obligations to call, give notice of and hold the
Rudolph Special Meeting and to seek the Rudolph Stockholder Approval at the
Rudolph Special Meeting, including if (x) a Rudolph Competing Proposal or
Rudolph Superior Proposal shall have made or received by Rudolph or (y) the
Rudolph Board of Directors shall have effected a Rudolph
Recommendation Change or announced or proposed any intention to do so.

(e) Subject to the foregoing provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.5_,
Nanometrics and Rudolph will use their respective reasonable best efforts to
hold the Nanometrics Special Meeting and the Rudolph Special Meeting on the
same date.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date,
if any, on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article
VIII_ , to the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of Nanometrics and
Rudolph will, and will cause their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the
other Party and to the Representatives of such other Party reasonable access
during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice to all of
their respective properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel designated on _Schedule 6.1(a)(i)_ (in the case of access to Rudolph
personnel) or _Schedule 6.1(a)(ii)_ (in the case of access to Nanometrics

and Rudolph will, and will cause each of Nanometrics Subsidiaries and the
Rudolph Subsidiaries, respectively, to, furnish reasonably promptly to the
other Party all information (financial or otherwise, including Tax Returns)
concerning its business, properties and personnel as such other Party may
reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Nanometrics nor
Rudolph will be required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ to provide the other
Party or the Representatives of such other Party with access to or to
disclose information (1) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement with a Third Party (as long as the withholding Party uses its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the required consent of such Third Party to
such access or disclosure), (2) the disclosure of which would violate any Law,
including the HSR Act (as long as the withholding Party uses its reasonable
best efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure not in violation of any Law) or (3) that is subject to any
attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege (as long as
the withholding Party uses its reasonable best efforts to allow for such
access or disclosure to the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of
any such attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege),
except in the case of this

 clause (3) to the extent reasonably required for the purpose of complying
with applicable Antitrust Laws, in which case such disclosure shall be made to
external counsel only and subject to prior execution of a common interest or
joint defense agreement in customary form. Each of Nanometrics and Rudolph
will use its reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the
businesses of the other Party that may result from the requests for access,
data and information hereunder. No investigation by any of the Parties or
their respective Representatives or information provided, made available or
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of any other Party set forth herein.

(b) Any information exchanged pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, will
be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(c) Nanometrics will give prompt notice to Rudolph, and Rudolph will give
prompt notice to Nanometrics, (1) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or other Transactions, or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Merger or the other Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication
or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent would reasonably be
expected to be material to Nanometrics, the Surviving Corporation or Rudolph,
(2) of any Action commenced or, to such Partys knowledge, threatened
against, such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to,
involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case in
connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any
other Transaction and (3) upon becoming aware of the occurrence of any event
or circumstance relating to it or any of the Nanometrics Subsidiaries or the
Rudolph Subsidiaries, respectively, that would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Nanometrics Material Adverse Effect
or a Rudolph Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay or impede
the consummation of the Transactions. The delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(c)_ will not cure any breach of any representation or
warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to
any Party.

 

Section 6.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, including (1) preparing and filing, in
consultation with the other Parties and as promptly as practicable and
advisable after the date hereof, all documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, filings, and other documents and to obtain
as promptly as practicable all waiting period expirations or terminations,
consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, Orders, registrations, approvals,
permits, and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
Governmental Authority in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
Transactions and (2) taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain all such
waiting period expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers,
licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, Orders and approvals. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to make
all necessary applications, notices, petitions and filings required (and
thereafter make any other required submissions and respond as promptly
as practicable to any requests for additional information or documentary
material) with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions (A) with the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") and the Federal
Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") on a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions and (B) any jurisdiction listed
in Section 6.2(a) of the Nanometrics Disclosure Letter (the
foregoing, collectively, the " _Specified Antitrust Authorities_ "). The
Parties agree to make the filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and
in any event within 10 business days after the execution of this Agreement
(unless another date is mutually agreed between the Parties), and to make a
filing in any jurisdiction listed in _Schedule 7.1(d)_ as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within 45 business days after the execution of
this Agreement (unless another date is mutually agreed between the Parties).
The Parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to supply as

 



56

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 promptly as practicable and advisable additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or by the Specified
Antitrust Authorities and to take all other actions necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
as soon as practicable.

 

(b) Each of Rudolph and Nanometrics will, in connection with the efforts
referenced in  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ to obtain all waiting period
expirations or terminations, consents, clearances, waivers, licenses, Orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, and authorizations for the Transactions
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, (1) cooperate in all respects
and consult with each other in connection with any filing or submission and in
connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding
initiated by a private party, including by allowing the other Party to have a
reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of filings
and submissions, (2) promptly inform the other Party of any communication
received by such Party from, and consult with the other Party and allow the
other Party to review in advance any material communications and promptly
inform the other Party of any communication or given by such Party to, the
DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Authority, by promptly providing
copies to the other Party (or to its outside counsel) of any such written
communications, and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the Transactions. Each Party, as they deem advisable and necessary, may
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other under this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ as "Outside Counsel Only
Material." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed
by such outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or other
Representatives of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in
advance from the source of the materials (Rudolph or Nanometrics, as the case
may be) or its legal counsel; _provided_ _further_ that materials whether
being submitted to the Party or to its outside counsel may be redacted (A) to
remove references concerning the valuation of Rudolph, Nanometrics or any of
their Subsidiaries, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements
and (C) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality
concerns and (3) to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or any other
applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, permit the other Party to
attend any meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with, the DOJ,
the FTC or any other Governmental Authority, or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private party, with any other Person. Rudolph and Nanometrics
shall jointly determine all communications and strategy relating to the
Antitrust Laws, and the Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another
and consider in good faith the views of one another regarding the form and
content of any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either
Party in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law
prior to their submission. Neither Party will agree to pull any filing, extend
any waiting period, or agree not to consummate the transaction for any period
of time without the written agreement of the other Party.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_, each
of Rudolph and Nanometrics will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
expiration or termination of all waiting periods and all consents, waivers,
authorizations and approvals of all third parties, including Governmental
Authorities, necessary, proper or advisable for the consummation of the
Transactions and to provide any notices to third parties required to be
provided by them prior to the Effective Time; _provided_  that without
consulting with Rudolph, Nanometrics will not incur any significant expense or
liability, enter into any significant new commitment or agreement or agree to
any significant modification to any contractual arrangement to obtain
such consents or certificates, and without consulting with Nanometrics,
Rudolph will not incur any significant expense or liability, enter into any
significant new commitment or agreement or agree to any significant
modification to any contractual arrangement to obtain such consents or
certificates. Without limiting the foregoing, Rudolph and Nanometrics shall
subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(d)_, as applicable, (i) each use its reasonable
best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any
decree, Order, or judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing,
on or before the Outside Date, including without limitation defending through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any Person and
(ii) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event
no later than the Outside Date), including (x) proposing, negotiating,
committing to

 



57

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 and (with effect from and after the Closing) effecting, by consent decree,
hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, licensing, divestiture or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Rudolph or Nanometrics (or any of
their respective Subsidiaries) and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that after the Closing Date would limit Rudolphs, Nanometricss, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries freedom of action with respect to, or
Rudolphs or Nanometricss ability to retain, one or more of their
Subsidiaries businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order, or other Order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the Closing.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ shall not be construed to require either Rudolph or
Nanometrics to, and, without the prior written consent of the other Party,
neither Rudolph nor Nanometrics shall, take (or agree to take) any action(s)
referred to in clauses (x) or (y) of  _Section_ __ _ 6.2(c)_ if such
action(s) would reasonably be expected to be material to Nanometrics and its
Subsidiaries (including Rudolph and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, at or
after the Effective Time.

 

Section 6.3 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement will be a joint press release in form and
substance acceptable to Nanometrics and Rudolph, respectively. Thereafter, so
long as this Agreement is in effect, neither Nanometrics nor Rudolph, nor any
of their respective affiliates, will issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement without the prior consent of the other such Party (such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless such Party
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by
applicable Law or by any listing agreement with or the listing rules of a
national securities exchange to issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement, in which event such Party will endeavor, on a basis reasonable
under the circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the
other Party to review and comment upon such press release or other
announcement in advance and will give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto. Nanometrics will not be
required by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ to provide any such opportunity to
Rudolph in connection with the receipt and existence of a Nanometrics
Competing Proposal or a Nanometrics Change of Recommendation, and Rudolph will
not be required by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ to provide any such opportunity
to Nanometrics in connection with the receipt and existence of a Rudolph
Competing Proposal or a Rudolph Change of Recommendation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, (1) each of Rudolph and
Nanometrics may make press releases or public announcements concerning this
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions that consists solely of
information previously disclosed in all material respects in previous press
releases or announcements made by Rudolph and/or Nanometrics in compliance
with this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ and (2) each of Rudolph and Nanometrics may
make public statements in response to specific questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analyst conference calls, and may make internal announcements to employees, so
long as any such statements consist solely of information previously
disclosed in all material respects in previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by Nanometrics and Rudolph and
do not reveal material, nonpublic information regarding the other parties,
this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions.

 

Section 6.4 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ Insurance and
Indemnification_. Nanometrics will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation
to, for six years from and after the Effective Time, indemnify and hold
harmless all past and present directors and officers of Nanometrics and
the Nanometrics Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Nanometrics Indemnified
Parties_ ") and all past and present directors and officers of Rudolph and the
Rudolph Subsidiaries (the " _Rudolph Indemnified Parties_ " and, collectively
with the Nanometrics Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any actual or
threatened claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party
to the fullest extent provided pursuant to the Nanometrics Governing Documents
or the organizational documents of any Nanometrics Subsidiary (in the case of
the Nanometrics Indemnified Parties) or the Rudolph Governing Documents or
the organizational documents of any Rudolph Subsidiary (in the case of the
Rudolph Indemnified Parties) or any indemnification agreements in existence on
the date of this Agreement

 with Nanometrics, Rudolph or either of their respective Subsidiaries, as
long as such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such funds to
which a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Merger or any of the other
Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time, in connection with such persons serving as an officer or director of
Nanometrics or any of the Nanometrics Subsidiaries or of Rudolph or any of
the Rudolph Subsidiaries, as applicable, or as an officer, director, employee
or other fiduciary of any other Person if such service was at the request or
for the benefit of Nanometrics or any of the Nanometrics Subsidiaries or
of Rudolph or any of the Rudolph Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the fullest
extent provided pursuant to the Nanometrics Governing Documents or the
organizational documents of any Nanometrics Subsidiary (in the case of the
Nanometrics Indemnified Parties) or the Rudolph Governing Documents or the
organizational documents of any Rudolph Subsidiary (in the case of the Rudolph
Indemnified Parties) or any indemnification agreements in existence on the
date of this Agreement with Nanometrics, Rudolph or either of their
respective Subsidiaries. All rights to elimination of liability,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in
favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in their respective certificate
of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) or in
any agreement will survive the Merger and the other Transactions and will
continue in full force and effect. For six years after the Effective Time,
Nanometrics will cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in the
Nanometrics Governing Documents, the Rudolph Governing Documents and any
other agreements of Nanometrics, the Nanometrics Subsidiaries, Rudolph or the
Rudolph Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party, in each case regarding
elimination of liability, indemnification of officers, directors and
employees and advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date of
this Agreement, and no such provision will be amended, modified or repealed in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights or protections thereunder
of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions). Nanometrics will
cause to be maintained, for an aggregate period of six years from the
Effective Time, (i) for the benefit of the Nanometrics Indemnified Parties, an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time that is no less favorable than
Nanometricss existing policy or, if insurance coverage that is no less
favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage (the " _Nanometrics D
andO Insurance_"); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Person will be required to
pay an annual premium for the Nanometrics DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of
the last annual premium paid by Nanometrics prior to the date of this
Agreement, as disclosed in _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ of the Nanometrics Disclosure
Letter; _provided_ _further_ that Nanometrics at any time may substitute
therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to Nanometrics DandO
Insurance with, if such tail coverage is obtained by Nanometrics prior to the
Effective Time, an annual cost not in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement, as disclosed in _Section_
__ _ 6.4 _of the Nanometrics Disclosure Letter and, if such tail coverage
shall be so purchased, after the Effective Time, Nanometrics shall maintain
such coverage in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations
thereunder; and (ii) for the benefit of the Rudolph Indemnified Parties, an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time that is no less favorable
than Rudolphs existing policy or, if insurance coverage that is no less
favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage (the " _Rudolph D andO
Insurance_"); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Person will be required to pay
an annual premium for the Rudolph DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid by Rudolph prior to the date of this Agreement, as
disclosed in _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ of the Rudolph Disclosure Letter; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Rudolph (prior to the Effective Time) or
Nanometrics (at or after the Effective Time) may substitute therefor a single
premium tail coverage with respect to the Rudolph DandO Insurance with, if such
tail coverage is obtained by Rudolph prior to the Effective Time, an annual
cost not in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date
of this Agreement as disclosed in _Section_ __ _ 6.4 _of the Rudolph
Disclosure Letter and, if such tail coverage shall be so purchased,
Nanometrics shall maintain such coverage in full force and effect and continue
to

 honor its obligations thereunder. In the event Nanometrics or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (1) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and will not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (2)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision will be made so that the
successors and assigns of Nanometrics or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, will assume the obligations of such Party set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_. The rights and obligations under this  _Section_ __ _
6.4_ will survive consummation of the Merger and will not be terminated or
amended in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Party without the
written consent of such Indemnified Party. The provisions of this  _Section_
__ _ 6.4_ are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives
and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under
Nanometricss or Rudolphs or any of their respective Subsidiaries
Organizational Documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in
any Contract of Nanometrics or Rudolph or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

 Section 6.5 _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties will use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or becomes applicable to
any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the Merger and the
other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize
the effect of such Takeover Statute on the Merger and the other Transactions.

 

Section 6.6 _Obligations of Merger Sub and Surviving
Corporation_. Nanometrics will take all action necessary to cause each of
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement before and after the Effective Time.

 

Section 6.7 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) From the Closing Date until the first anniversary of the Closing Date
or until an earlier date of termination of employment, Nanometrics, the
Surviving Corporation or an applicable Subsidiary will (and Nanometrics will
cause the Surviving Corporation or Subsidiary to) provide to the individuals
who continue in the service of Nanometrics or the Surviving Corporation or a
Subsidiary of either at and after the Closing (a " _Continuing Service
Provider_ ") (i) base salary or wages that is no less favorable than the base
salary or wages provided to such Continuing Service Provider immediately
prior to the Closing, (ii) bonus or incentive opportunities that are no less
favorable than the bonus or incentive opportunities (excluding value
attributable to equity-based compensation) provided to such Continuing
Service Provider immediately prior to the Closing and (iii) employee and
fringe benefits (including severance benefits, and group health, life and
disability plans, but excluding benefits provided pursuant to any defined
benefit pension plan) that are no less favorable in the aggregate to such
Continuing Service Providers than the employee and fringe benefits provided to
such persons in the aggregate immediately prior to the Closing, without being
required to take into account any equity-related, retention, deal bonus, or
other compensation related to or affected by the Merger.

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA maintained by Nanometrics, the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary
of either in which any Continuing Service Provider will participate effective
as of or after the Effective Time (collectively, " _New Plans_ "), subject to
applicable Law and applicable Tax qualification requirements, Nanometrics
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of
the Continuing Service Provider with Rudolph or a Rudolph Subsidiary, as the
case may be, as of the Effective Time for vesting, eligibility and level of
benefits purposes (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under a defined
benefit plan) in any New Plan in which such Continuing Service Providers are
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, in each case except to the
extent that recognizing such service would result in a duplication of
benefits.

 

(c) To the extent any Continuing Service Provider participates in a New
Plan on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date that is a welfare
plan of Nanometrics and the terms of such New Plan then

 



60

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 permit or revision to such terms to so permit would be commercially
reasonable, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of either (a "
_Nanometrics Welfare Plan_ "), Nanometrics will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries to, cause all (1) pre-existing condition
limitations which otherwise would be applicable to such Continuing Service
Provider and his or her covered dependents to be waived to the extent
satisfied under a Nanometrics Plan comparable to such Nanometrics Welfare Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date or, if later, immediately prior to such
Continuing Service Providers commencement of participation in such
Nanometrics Welfare Plan, (2) participation waiting periods, actively at work
requirements, and insurability requirements under each Nanometrics Welfare
Plan that would otherwise be applicable to such Continuing Service Provider
to be waived to the same extent waived or satisfied under the Rudolph Plan
comparable to such Nanometrics Welfare Plan immediately prior to the Closing
Date or, if later, immediately prior to such Continuing Service Providers
commencement of participation in such Nanometrics Welfare Plan and (3) co-
payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing
Service Providers in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to be
credited for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment and
maximum out of pocket requirement under any such Nanometrics Welfare Plan.

 

(d) If requested by Nanometrics at least ten (10) business days prior to
the Closing, then effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding
the Closing, Rudolph will terminate each Rudolph Plan intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (each a "
_Rudolph 401(k) Plan_ "). In the event that Nanometrics requests that any
such Rudolph 401(k) Plan be terminated, each Continuing Service Provider who
is a participant in a Rudolph 401(k) Plan (each, a "401(k) Participant") will
be allowed to participate, as soon as practicable following the Closing, in a
tax qualified plan that includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended to
satisfy the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Code that is sponsored by
Nanometrics or an affiliate of Nanometrics (the " _Nanometrics 401(k) Plan_
") and will be credited with eligibility service and vesting service for all
periods of service with Rudolph or any Rudolph Subsidiary to the extent so
credited with such service under the applicable Rudolph 401(k) Plan. In
addition, Nanometrics will, or will cause an affiliate to, take all actions
necessary so that the Nanometrics 401(k) Plan will accept rollover
contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning
of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans) from the Rudolph
401(k) Plan and Nanometrics (or its affiliate) will thereafter maintain such
loan under the Nanometrics 401(k) Plan. During the period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending at the time of the rollover of promissory notes and
related account balances, such loans will continue to be maintained under the
applicable Rudolph 401(k) Plan and Nanometrics will make, or will cause an
affiliate to make, payroll deductions in respect of required payments under
any such loan and timely remit such amounts to the Rudolph 401(k) Plan as
payments on such loan. During such period, provided that the 401(k)
Participant continues to make all required installment payments with respect
to such loan, such loan will not be placed in default, and Rudolph and
Nanometrics will take all necessary action to cause such loan not to be placed
in default.

 

(e) The Parties agree that the Merger shall constitute or be deemed to
constitute a "change of control" and "change in control" for purposes of the
Rudolph Plans, the Nanometrics Plans, and the awards issued and protections
provided under each.

 

(f) _Bonus and Profit Sharing Plan Treatment_.

 

(1) Each participant in a Rudolph Plan that provides for annual cash
incentive compensation based on the achievement of corporate and/or business
unit performance goals (each, a " _Rudolph Bonus Plan Participant_ ") shall
receive a payment in the first payroll whose cutoff date follows the Closing
equal to the product of (i) such participants target cash bonus (solely to
the extent allocated to the achievement of such corporate and/or business unit
performance goals) as in effect immediately prior to Closing and (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year
between January 1 and the Closing, and the denominator of which is 365. Each
Rudolph Bonus Plan Participant who is a Continuing Service Provider as of
December 31 of the year in which Closing occurs shall receive a payment in
accordance with Rudolphs ordinary course bonus practices equal to the product
of (i) such participants target cash bonus (solely to the extent allocated to
the achievement 

 



61

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 of such corporate and/or business unit performance goals) as of immediately
prior to Closing and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the calendar year between the Closing and December 31, and the
denominator of which is 365. Annual incentive compensation under any Rudolph
Plan based on the achievement of individual performance goals will be
determined and paid after the Closing in the ordinary course of business
based on actual achievement. Notwithstanding and in lieu of the foregoing, any
Rudolph Bonus Plan Participant whose bonus is subject to a key executive
incentive compensation plan (a " _KEICP_ ") shall have the treatment provided
by the KEICP.

(2) Each participant in the Nanometrics Plan that provides for annual
cash incentive compensation based on the achievement of corporate and

and Annexes and Schedules to this Agreement. The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. References herein to a Person are also to such Persons
successors and permitted assigns. All references in this Agreement to "$"or
other monetary amounts refer to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically
provided for herein, the term "or" will not be deemed to be exclusive. The
table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference purposes only and will not affect or be deemed to affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any term or provision
hereof. When reference is made herein to a Person, such reference will be
deemed to include all direct and indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless
otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires. All references herein
to the Subsidiaries of a Person will be deemed to include all direct and
indirect Subsidiaries of such Person unless otherwise indicated or the context

waive the application of any Law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will

Section 9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and

"), in any number of counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of

 



86

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 which when executed and delivered will be deemed to be an original but all
of which taken together will constitute one and the same agreement. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered using Electronic Delivery will be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and
will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party will raise the
use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract,
and each such Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent
that such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

 Section 9.9 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

(a) This Agreement (including the Nanometrics Disclosure Letter and the
Rudolph Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersede all other prior agreements (except that the
Confidentiality Agreement will be deemed amended hereby so that until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_,
Nanometrics, Rudolph and Merger Sub will be permitted to take the actions
contemplated by this Agreement) and understandings, both written and oral,
among the Parties or any of them with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.

 

(b) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, neither this Agreement
(including the Nanometrics Disclosure Letter and the Rudolph Disclosure
Letter) nor the Confidentiality Agreement are intended to confer upon any
Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
will nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Merger are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 9.11 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to conflicts of laws
principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state.

 

(b) Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court
finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any
thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement
of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally (1) agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding
except in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if)
such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Federal court of
the United States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from
any thereof, (2) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, the Federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, (3) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding
in such courts and (4) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in such courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final

 



87

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 judgment in any such action or proceeding will be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each Party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.11(b)_ in the manner provided for
notices in  _Section_ __ _ 9.4_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the
right of any Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 

Section 9.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to
this Agreement and any of the agreements delivered in connection herewith or
the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each
Party certifies and acknowledges that (a) no representative, agent or attorney
of any other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
Party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce either of such
waivers, (b) it understands and has considered the implications of such
waivers, (c) it makes such waivers voluntarily and (d) it has been induced to
enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this _Section_ __ _ 9.12_.

 

Section 9.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement will not be assigned by any of
the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in
its sole discretion and without the consent of any other party, any or all of
its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to (1) Nanometrics or (2) a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Nanometrics; _provided_ that no such assignment
will relieve any Nanometrics Entity of any obligation or liability under this
Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving any Party
of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

 

Section 9.14 _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon
such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed that prior to the
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ , each Party
will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a
decree or Order of specific performance to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and to any further equitable relief.

 

(c) The Parties rights in this _Section_ __ _ 9.14_ are an integral part
of the Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.14_ (including any objection on the
basis that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For purposes
of clarity, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for
a breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks any
remedy referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 9.14_, such Party will not be
required to obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy.

ARTICLE I

 

 _STOCKHOLDERS_

 

1.1 _Place of Meetings_. All meetings of stockholders shall be held at
such place, if any, as may be designated from time to time by the Board of
Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the
President or, if not so designated, at the principal executive office of the
corporation. The Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine
that a meeting shall not be held at any place, but shall instead be held
solely by means of remote communication in a manner consistent with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 

1.2 _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of stockholders for the election
of directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly
be brought before the meeting shall be held on a date and at a time designated
by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive
Officer or the President. The corporation may postpone, reschedule or cancel
any previously scheduled annual meeting of stockholders.

 

1.3 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose
or purposes may be called at any time only by the Board of Directors, the
Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President, and may
not be called by any other person or persons. Business transacted at any
special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to matters relating to the
purpose or purposes stated in the notice of meeting. The Board of Directors
may postpone, reschedule or cancel any previously scheduled special meeting of
stockholders.

 

1.4 _Notice of Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, notice of each meeting of
stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled
to vote at such meeting. Without limiting the manner by which notice
otherwise may be given to stockholders, any notice shall be effective if given
by a form of electronic transmission consented to (in a manner consistent with
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware) by the stockholder to
whom the notice is given. The notices of all meetings shall state the place,
if any, date and time of the meeting and the means of remote communications,
if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in
person and vote at such meeting. The notice of a special meeting shall state,
in addition, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. If
notice is given by mail, such notice shall be deemed given when deposited in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such
stockholders address as it appears on the records of the corporation. If
notice is given by electronic transmission, such notice shall be deemed given
at the time specified in Section 232 of the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware.

 

1.5 _Voting List_. The corporation shall prepare, at least 10 days before
every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled
to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the
address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of
each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any
stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting: (a) on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain
access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b), for a
period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting during ordinary business
hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation. If the meeting
is to be held at a physical location (and not solely by means of
remote communication), then the list shall be produced and kept at the time
and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be examined by
any stockholder who is present. Except as otherwise provided by law, such list
shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine
the list of stockholders required by this Section 1.5 or to vote in person or
by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.

 

1.6 _Quorum_. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the holders of a majority in voting power
of the shares of the capital stock of the corporation issued and outstanding
and entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person, present by means of
remote communication in a manner, if any, authorized by the Board of
Directors in its sole discretion, or represented by proxy, shall constitute a

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 quorum for the transaction of business; provided, however, that where a
separate vote by a class or classes or series of capital stock is required by
law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority in voting
power of the shares of such class or classes or series of the capital stock of
the corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on such matter,
present in person, present by means of remote communication in a manner, if
any, authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with
respect to the vote on such matter. A quorum, once established at a meeting,
shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a
quorum.

 

1.7 _Adjournments_. Any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned from time
to time to reconvene at any other time and to any other place at which a
meeting of stockholders may be held under these Bylaws by the chairman of the
meeting or by a majority of the stockholders present or represented at the
meeting and entitled to vote, although less than a quorum. It shall not be
necessary to notify any stockholder of any adjournment of less than 30 days if
the time and place, if any, of the adjourned meeting, and the means of remote
communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed
to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, are announced at
the meeting at which adjournment is taken, unless after the adjournment a new
record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting. At the adjourned meeting, the
corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the
original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the
adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at the meeting.

1.8 _Voting and Proxies_. Each stockholder shall have one vote upon the
matter in question for each share of stock entitled to vote held of record by
such stockholder and a proportionate vote for each fractional share so held,
unless otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation. Each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders, or to
express consent or dissent to corporate action without a meeting, may vote or
express such consent or dissent in person (including by means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders may be deemed to be
present in person and vote at such meeting) or may authorize another person or
persons to vote or act for such stockholder by a proxy executed or transmitted
in a manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
by the stockholder or such stockholders authorized agent and delivered
(including by electronic transmission) to the Secretary of the corporation. No
such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from the date of
its execution, unless the proxy expressly provides for a longer period. A
proxy shall be irrevocable if it satisfies the requirements to qualify as
irrevocable under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 

1.9 _Action at Meeting_. When a quorum is present at any meeting, any
matter, other than the election of directors, to be voted upon by the
stockholders at such meeting shall be decided by the vote of the holders of
shares of stock having a majority in voting power of the votes cast by the
holders of all of the shares of stock present or represented at the meeting
and voting affirmatively or negatively on such matter (or if there are two or
more classes or series of stock entitled to vote as separate classes, then in
the case of each such class or series, the holders of a majority in voting
power of the shares of stock of that class or series present or represented at
the meeting and voting affirmatively or negatively on such matter), except
when a different vote is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws. When a quorum is present at any meeting, any election by
stockholders of directors shall be determined by the vote of the majority of
the votes cast; provided, however, that if, as of the tenth (10th) day
preceding the date the corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such
meeting the stockholders of the corporation, the number of nominees exceeds
the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the
vote of a plurality of the votes cast. For purposes of this bylaw, "a majority
of the votes cast" shall mean that number of shares cast "for" a directors
election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that directors election
(with "abstentions" and "broker non-votes" not counted as a vote cast either
"for" or "against" that directors election).

1.10 _Conduct of Meetings_.

 

(a) _Chairman of Meeting_. Unless otherwise provided by the Board of
Directors, meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman of
the Board, if any, or in the Chairmans absence by the

 Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the Vice Chairmans absence by the
Chief Executive Officer, or in the Chief Executive Officers absence, by the
President, or in the Presidents absence by a Vice President, or in the
absence of all of the foregoing persons by a chairman designated by the Board
of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chairman chosen by
the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock entitled to vote
thereat, present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting. The
Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in the Secretarys
absence the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as
secretary of the meeting.

(b) _Rules, Regulations and Procedures_. The Board of Directors may adopt
by resolution such rules, regulations and procedures for the conduct of any
meeting of stockholders of the corporation as it shall deem appropriate
including, without limitation, such guidelines and procedures as it may deem
appropriate regarding the participation by means of remote communication of
stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting. Except to
the extent inconsistent with such rules, regulations and procedures as adopted
by the Board of Directors, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall
have the right and authority to convene and to recess and/or adjourn the
meeting and prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all
such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the
proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether
adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the
meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment
of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures
for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii)
limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders
entitled to vote at the meeting, their duly authorized and constituted
proxies or such other persons as shall be determined; (iv) restrictions on
entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and
(v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by
participants. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or
the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to
be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.

1.11 _Action without Meeting_.

 

(a) _Taking of Action by Consent_. Any action required or permitted to be
taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation may
be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a
consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be
signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum
number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on such action were present and
voted. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of
Incorporation, stockholders may act by written consent to elect directors;
provided, however, that, if such consent is less than unanimous, such action
by written consent may be in lieu of holding an annual meeting only if all of
the directorships to which directors could be elected at an annual meeting
held at the effective time of such action are vacant and are filled by such
action.

 

(b) _Electronic Transmission of Consents_. A telegram, cablegram or other
electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted
by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act
for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and
dated for the purposes of this section, provided that any such telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with
information from which the corporation can determine (i) that the telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission was transmitted by the
stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for
the stockholder or proxyholder and (ii) the date on which such stockholder or
proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the
date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram, cablegram
or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until
such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be
delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State
of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the
corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to a corporations registered office
shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on delivery,
consents given

 by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission may be otherwise
delivered to the principal place of business of the corporation or to an
officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded if, to the extent and in
the manner provided by resolution of the Board of Directors. Any copy,
facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may
be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all
purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such
copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the
entire original writing.

 

(c) _Notice of Taking of Corporate Action_. Prompt notice of the taking of
corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent
shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and
who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to
notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date
that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the
action were delivered to the corporation.

such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of
Directors and subject to the provisions of law, shall have and may exercise
all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of
the business and affairs of the corporation and may authorize the seal of the
corporation to be affixed to all papers that may require it. Each

Incorporation, the whole or any part of any unissued balance of the authorized
capital stock of the corporation or the whole or any part of any shares of the

the Board of Directors in such manner, for such lawful consideration and on
such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.

 

4.2 _Stock Certificates; Uncertificated Shares_. The shares of the
corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the Board of
Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or
all classes or series of the corporations stock shall be uncertificated

summarized on the face or back of each certificate representing shares of such
class or series of stock, provided that in lieu of the foregoing requirements
there may be set forth on the face or back of each certificate representing
shares of such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will
furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests a copy of the full
text of the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating,
optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and
the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or
rights.

 

Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated
shares, the registered owner thereof shall be given a notice, in writing or
by electronic transmission, containing the information required to be set
forth or stated on certificates pursuant to Sections 151, 156, 202(a) or

Subject to applicable law, shares of stock represented by certificates shall
be transferred only on the books of the corporation by the surrender to the
corporation or its transfer agent of the certificate representing such shares
properly endorsed or accompanied by a written assignment or power of attorney
properly executed, and with such proof of authority or the authenticity of
signature as the corporation or its transfer agent may reasonably require.
Uncertificated shares may be transferred by delivery of a written assignment
or power of attorney properly executed, and with such proof of authority or
the authenticity of signature as the corporation or its transfer agent may
reasonably require. Except as may be otherwise required by law, by the
Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, the corporation shall be
entitled to treat the record holder of stock as shown on its books as the
owner of such stock for all purposes, including the payment of dividends and
the right to vote with respect to such stock, regardless of any transfer,
pledge or other disposition of such stock until the shares have been
transferred on the books of the corporation in accordance with
the requirements of these Bylaws.

4.4 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. The corporation may issue a
new certificate of stock in place of any previously issued certificate alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon such terms and conditions as the
corporation may prescribe, including the presentation of reasonable evidence
of such loss, theft or destruction and the giving of such indemnity and
posting of such bond as the corporation may require for the protection of the
corporation or any transfer agent or registrar.

 

4.5 _Record Date_. The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date as a
record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of
or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or to express consent (or dissent)
to corporate action without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any
dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action. Such record date shall not precede the date on which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and such record date shall not
be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting, nor
more than 10 days after the date of adoption of a record date for a consent
without a meeting, nor more than 60 days prior to any other action to which
such record date relates.

If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day before the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day before the day on which
the meeting is held. If no record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is
necessary, shall be the day on which the first consent is properly delivered
to the corporation. If no record date is fixed, the record date for
determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of
business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution
relating to such purpose.

 

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for
the adjourned meeting.

 

4.6 _Regulations_. The issue, transfer, conversion and registration of
shares of stock of the corporation shall be governed by such other
regulations as the Board of Directors may establish.

signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by
electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether provided
before, at or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given,
shall be deemed equivalent to notice required to be given to such person.
Neither the business nor the purpose of any meeting need be specified in any
such waiver. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened.

5.4   _Voting of Securities_. Except as the Board of Directors may
otherwise designate, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the

persons to act as, proxy or attorney-in-fact for this corporation (with or
without power of substitution) at, any meeting of stockholders or
securityholders of any other entity, the securities of which may be held by
this corporation, or with respect to the execution of any written or
electronic consent in the name of the corporation as a holder of such
securities.

5.5 _Evidence of Authority_. A certificate by the Secretary, or an
Assistant Secretary, or a temporary Secretary, as to any action taken by the
stockholders, directors, a committee or any officer or representative of the
corporation shall as to all persons who rely on the certificate in good
faith be conclusive evidence of such action.

Certificate of Incorporation shall be deemed to refer to the Certificate of
Incorporation of the corporation, as amended and in effect from time to time.

 

5.7 _Severability_. Any determination that any provision of these Bylaws

ARTICLE VI

 

 _INDEMNITY_

 

6.1 _Third Party Actions_. The corporation shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other
than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact
that such person is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or, while
a director or officer of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the corporation,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if
such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe such persons conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.5, the
corporation shall be required to indemnify a director or officer in connection
with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such director or officer only
if the commencement of such proceeding (or part 

 



9

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 thereof) by the director or officer was authorized in the specific case by
the board of directors of the corporation. The termination of any action, suit
or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of
_nolo contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which
the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest
of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
had reasonable cause to believe that the persons conduct was unlawful.

 

6.2 _Actions by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The corporation
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify any person who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against expenses (including attorneys fees) and amounts paid in settlement
(if such settlement is approved in advance by the corporation, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably incurred by such
person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if
such person acted in good faith and in manner such person reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that
no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as
to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation
unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court
in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application
that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the
circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such
other court shall deem proper. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except
as otherwise provided in Section 6.5, the corporation shall be required to
indemnify a director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) commenced by such director or officer only if the commencement of
such proceeding (or part thereof) by the director or officer was authorized in
the specific case by the board of directors of the
corporation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI, no
person shall be indemnified hereunder for any expenses or amounts paid in
settlement with respect to any action to recover short-swing profits under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. 

6.3 _Successful Defense_. To the extent that a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation has been successful on the merits or
otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections
6.1 and 6.2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person
shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by law against expenses
(including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in
connection therewith.

 

6.4 _Payment of Expenses in Advance_. Expenses incurred in defending a
civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding, by an individual who may be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 6.1 or 6.2, shall be paid by
the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director,
officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
corporation as authorized in this Article VI.

 

6.5 _Claims_. If a claim by a director or officer for indemnification
(following the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding) or
advancement of expenses under this Article VI is not paid in full within
thirty days after a written claim therefor by the person entitled to
indemnification hereunder has been received by the corporation, such person
may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such
claim. In any such action the corporation shall have the burden of proving
that such person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or
advancement of expenses under applicable law.

 

6.6 _Indemnity Not Exclusive_. The indemnification and advancement of
expenses provided by or granted pursuant to the other sections of this
Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those

 



10

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any
by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors
or otherwise, both as to action in such persons official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office.

 

6.7 _Insurance_. The corporation shall have the power to purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any
such capacity or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not
the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
liability under the provisions of this Article VI.

6.8   _Other Sources_. The corporations obligation, if any, to indemnify
or to advance expenses to any person who was or is serving at its request as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity shall be reduced by any
amount such person may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses
from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or
non-profit enterprise.

6.9 _The Corporation_. For purposes of this Article VI, references to
"the corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any
constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed
in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued,
would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers,
employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under and subject to the
provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation the provisions of
Section 6.4) with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such
person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if
its separate existence had continued.

6.10 _Employee Benefit Plans_. For purposes of this Article VI,
references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans;
references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with
respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the
request of the corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves
services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an
employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in
the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee
benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the
best interests of the corporation" as referred to in this Article VI.

 

6.11 _Continuation of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted
pursuant to, this Article VI shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized
or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

ARTICLE VII

 

 _AMENDMENTS_

 

7.1 _By the Board of Directors_. These Bylaws may be altered, amended
or repealed, in whole or in part, or new bylaws may be adopted by the Board

  ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding") by reason of the fact that
he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or

serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust,

extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be
amended, any employee or agent of the corporation who was or is made or is

or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture,

IX, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this Article IX in respect of any
matter occurring, or any cause of action, suit or claim accruing or arising or
that, but for this Article IX, would accrue or arise, prior to such

rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this
reservation.

 

ARTICLE XI

A director of the corporation shall not be liable to the corporation or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is
not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended.

adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the corporation
hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of
such amendment, modification or repeal.

 determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of
the corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholders
understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such proposed nominee.

(ii) _Advance Notice of Stockholders Business_

 

At the annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be

120th day, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual

anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered
not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual
meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day
prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public
announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the corporation.
A stockholders notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter the

description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting,
the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions
proposed for consideration and, in the event that such business includes a

stock required to adopt the proposal and/or (y) otherwise solicit proxies
from stockholders in support of such proposal, (vi) any material interest of
the stockholder or beneficial owner in such business, (vii) a description of
any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the proposal
between or among such stockholder and/or such beneficial owner, any of their

understanding (including any derivative or short positions, profit interests,
options, warrants, convertible securities, stock appreciation or similar
rights, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been
entered into as of the date of the stockholders notice by, or on behalf of,
such stockholder and such beneficial owners, whether or not such instrument or
right shall be subject to settlement in underlying shares of capital stock of
the corporation, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to, manage
risk or benefit of share price changes for, or increase or decrease the voting
power of, such stockholder or such beneficial owner, with respect
to securities of the corporation and (vii) any other information relating to
such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, that is required to be
disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in
connection with solicitations of proxies for the proposal pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. The foregoing notice requirements of this
Section 2.5(ii) shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder with respect to
any business for which the stockholder has notified the corporation of his,
her or its intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting in compliance
with applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Exchange Act and such stockholders proposal has been included in a proxy
statement that has been prepared by the corporation to solicit proxies for
such annual meeting.

 

(iii) _Special Meetings of Stockholders._

 

Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as
shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporations
notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the board of
directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors
are to be elected pursuant to the corporations notice of meeting (a) by or
at the direction of the board of directors or any committee thereof or (b)
provided that the board of directors has determined that directors shall be
elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the corporation who is
a stockholder of record at the time of notice provided for in this Section
2.5 is delivered to the secretary of the corporation, who is entitled to vote
at the meeting and upon such election and who complies with the notice
procedures set forth in this Section 2.5. In the event the corporation calls
a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more
directors to the board of directors, any such stockholder entitled to vote in
such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may
be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporations notice
of meeting, if the stockholders notice required by this Section 2.5 (which
shall include all of the information, agreements and representations required
by Section 2.5(i) as if such stockholder was nominating such person or persons
for election at an annual meeting) shall be delivered to the secretary at the
principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the close of
business on the 120th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the
close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting
or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made
of the date of the special meeting at which directors are to be elected. In no
event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of a
special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for
the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.

(iv) _General_

 

No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation
unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
2.5, and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as
shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 2.5. The chairman of the meeting shall have the
power and duty to determine and declare whether a nomination was properly made
or business was properly brought before the meeting, in accordance with the
procedures prescribed by these bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall
so declare at the meeting and the defective nomination or any such business
not properly brought before the meeting shall be disregarded. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.5, unless otherwise required by
law, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder)
does not appear at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the
corporation to present a nomination or proposed business, such nomination
shall be disregarded and such proposed business shall not be transacted,
notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by
the corporation. For purposes of this Section 2.5, to be considered a
qualified representative of the stockholder, a person must be a duly
authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or must be
authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder or an electronic
transmission delivered by such stockholder to act for such stockholder as
proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person must produce such
writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable reproduction of the writing
or electronic transmission, at the meeting of stockholders.

 

For purposes of this Section 2.5, "public announcement" shall include
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. In no event shall the public announcement of an
adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period
(or extend any time period) for the giving of any stockholders notice as
described above.

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.5, a stockholder
shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth in
this Section 2.5; provided however, that any references in these bylaws to the
Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not
intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or
proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to this Section
2.5 (including paragraphs (i)(3), (ii)(c) and (iii) hereof), and compliance
with paragraphs (i)(3), (ii)(c) and (iii) of this Section 2.5 shall be the
exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business
(other than, as provided in the last sentence of Section 2.5(ii), business
other than nominations brought properly under and in compliance with Rule
14a-8 of the Exchange Act, as may be amended from time to time). Nothing in
this Section 2.5 shall be deemed to affect any rights (a) of stockholders to
request inclusion of proposals or nominations in the corporations proxy
statement pursuant to applicable rules or regulations promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (b) of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect
directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of the certificate of
incorporation.

 

Notwithstanding anything in Section 2.5(i) to the contrary, in the event that
the number of directors to be elected to the board of directors at the annual
meeting is increased effective after the time period for which stockholder
nominations would otherwise be due under Section 2.5(i) and there is no public
announcement by the corporation naming the nominees for the additional
directorships at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the
preceding years annual meeting, a stockholders notice required by Section
2.5(i) shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees
for the additional directorships, if it shall be delivered to the secretary
of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation not
later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which
such public announcement is first made by the corporation.



   2.6. |

MANNER OF GIVING NOTICE; AFFIDAVIT OF NOTICE 

---|--- 
 

Notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, shall be deemed to be given
when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the
stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. An
affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent
of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of
fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

Without limiting the foregoing, any notice to stockholders given by
the corporation shall be effective if given by a form of electronic
transmission permitted by applicable law. For purposes of these bylaws,
"electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly
involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may
be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be
directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated
process.

 

Without limiting the foregoing, any notice to stockholders given by the
corporation may be given by a single written notice to stockholders who share
an address if consented to by the stockholders at such address to whom such
notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholders by
written notice to the corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object
in writing to the corporation, within 60 days of having been given written
notice by the corporation of its intention to send the single notice as set
forth in this Section 2.6 shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such
single written notice.



   2.7. |

QUORUM 

---|--- 
 

The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to
vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a
quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business
except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of
incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any
meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or
(ii) the holders of a majority in voting power of the stock entitled to vote
thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to
adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement
at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned
meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be
transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
noticed.

ADJOURNED MEETING; NOTICE 

---|--- 
 

When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws
otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the
time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment
is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business
that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after
the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled
to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the board of directors shall fix
as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such
adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination
of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and a notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at the meeting as of the record date so fixed for notice of the adjourned
meeting.

 



   2.9. |

CONDUCT OF BUSINESS 

---|--- 
 

Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the chairman of the board
of directors, if any, or in his or her absence by a person designated by the
board of directors, or in the absence of a person so designated by the board
of directors, by a chairman chosen at the meeting by the holders of a majority
in voting power of the stock entitled to vote thereat, present in person
or represented by proxy. The secretary, or in his or her absence, an
assistant secretary, or in the absence of the secretary and all assistant
secretaries, a person whom the chairman of the meeting shall appoint, shall
act as secretary of the meeting and keep a record of the proceedings thereof.

The board of directors shall be entitled to make such rules or regulations for
the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it shall deem necessary,
appropriate or convenient. Subject to such rules and regulations of the board
of directors, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and
authority to convene and to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe
such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the
judgment of such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the
proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an
agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for
maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations
on participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation,
their duly authorized and constituted proxies and such other persons as the
chairman shall permit, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time
fixed for the commencement thereof and limitations on the time allotted to
questions or comments by participants. The chairman of the meeting, in
addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the
conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to
the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the
meeting and if the chairman should so determine, he or she shall so declare to
the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the
meeting shall not be transacted or considered. Unless and to the extent
determined by the board of directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings
of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules
of parliamentary procedure.

 



   2.10. |

VOTING 

---|--- 
 

The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be
determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these bylaws,
subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint
owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).

 

Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each
stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock
held by such stockholder.

Except as otherwise required by law or by the certificate of incorporation,
each director shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast
with respect to the director at any meeting for the election of directors at
which a quorum is present; provided, however, that if, as of the tenth (10th)
day preceding the date the 

 



6

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting to the
stockholders of the corporation, the number of nominees exceeds the number of
directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a
plurality of the votes cast. For purposes of this bylaw, "a majority of the
votes cast" shall mean that the number of shares cast "for" a directors
election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that directors election
(with "abstentions" and "broker non-votes" not counted as a vote cast either
"for" or "against" that directors election).

All other elections and questions presented to the stockholders at a meeting
at which a quorum is present shall, unless otherwise provided by the
certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, the rules or regulations of any
stock exchange applicable to the corporation, applicable law or pursuant to
any regulation applicable to the corporation or its securities, be decided by
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the
shares of stock of the corporation which are present in person or represented
by proxy and entitled to vote thereon.

 



   2.11. |

WAIVER OF NOTICE 

---|--- 
 

Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the Delaware
General Corporation Law or of the certificate of incorporation or these
bylaws, a waiver, given by the person entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express
purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of
any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither
the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special
meeting of the stockholders, directors, or members of a committee of directors
need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the
certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

 



   2.12. |

RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING 

---|--- 
 

In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any
adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in
respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of
any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record
date which (i) in the case of determination of stockholders entitled to notice
of any meeting of stockholders or adjournment thereof, shall, unless otherwise
required by law, not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days
before the date of such meeting (which date shall also be the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the board
of directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, that a later
date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such
determination), and (ii) in the case of any other lawful action, shall not be
more than sixty (60) days prior to such other action. If no record date is
fixed: (1) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of
or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on
the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is
waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which
the meeting is held and (2) the record date for determining stockholders for
any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the
Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting;
provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for
determination of the stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting,
and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled
to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed
for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance herewith at
the adjourned meeting.



   2.13. |

PROXIES 

---|--- 
 

Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize
another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such
proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its

 



7

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be
irrevocable if it satisfies the requirements to qualify as irrevocable under
the Delaware General Corporation Law. A stockholder may revoke any proxy
which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by
delivering to the secretary of the corporation a revocation of the proxy or a
new proxy bearing a later date.

 



   2.14. |

LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE 

---|--- 
 

The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare
and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a
complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (provided,
however, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote
is less than ten (10) days before the date of the meeting, the list
shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before
the meeting date), arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of
each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a
period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, (i) on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain
access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting or (ii) during
ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the corporation.
The list of stockholders must also be open to examination at the meeting as
required by applicable law. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock
ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to
examine the list of stockholders required by this Section 2.14 or to vote in
person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.



   2.15. |

INSPECTORS OF ELECTIONS 

---|--- 
 

The corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting
of stockholders, appoint one or three inspectors of election, who may be
employees of the corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof
and to make a written report thereof. The corporation may designate one or
more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails
to act. If there are three (3) inspectors of election, the decision, act or
certificate of a majority is effective in all respects as the decision, act or
certificate of all. In the event that no inspector so appointed or designated
is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the
meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each
inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take
and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict
impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or
inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares
of capital stock of the corporation outstanding and the voting power of each
such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the corporation
represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii)
count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable
period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination
by the inspectors (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of
capital stock of the corporation represented at the meeting and such
inspectors count of all votes and ballots and (vi) do any other acts that may
be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.
Such certification and report shall specify such other information as may be
required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and
ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the corporation, the inspectors
may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person
who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at
such election. Any report or certificate made by the inspectors of election is
prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to
pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.

 



   7.3. |

STOCK CERTIFICATES; PARTLY PAID SHARES 

---|--- 
 

The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided
that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or
resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock
shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares
represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to
the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the
board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be
entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by
any two authorized officers of the corporation (it being understood that each
of the chairman and the vice-chairman of the board of directors, the chief
executive officer, the president, any vice-president, the chief financial
officer, any assistant treasurer, the secretary and any assistant secretary
of the corporation shall be an authorized officer for this purpose)
representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all
of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer,
transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has
been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent
or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the
corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer
agent or registrar at the date of issue.

The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid
and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid
therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent
any such partly paid shares, upon the books and records of the corporation in
the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the
consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated.
Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation
shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only
upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.

or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full
or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation
shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however,
that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth
on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to
represent such class or series of stock a statement that

any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the corporation a

on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate
or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

arising pursuant to any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or these
bylaws (in each case, as they may be amended from time to time) or governed by
the internal affairs doctrine.

bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon
the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their
power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
