Objection Notice is delivered as provided above, the Buyer and the
Stockholders\' Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve such
dispute, and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final,
binding and conclusive on the parties. If the parties are unable to resolve,
despite good faith negotiations, all disputes reflected in the Objection

the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties (save in the event of fraud or manifest error). The fees and expenses
of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be split equally by the Buyer and
the Stockholders (pro rata between the Stockholders). The Cash, Indebtedness,
Working Capital, Employee Liabilities and Tax Liabilities reflected in the
Closing Calculation, as agreed or determined by the parties and as may be
revised to take into account the resolution of any and all disputes by the
parties and/or the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be deemed to be the
final "Closing Calculation". If following the agreement or the determination
of the Closing Calculation:

(a) the Working Capital is more than the Estimated Working Capital and/or the
Cash is more than the Estimated Cash and/or the Estimated Indebtedness is less
than the Indebtedness and/or the Estimated Tax Liabilities is less than the
Tax Liabilities, such aggregate excess shall be payable to the Stockholders
(subject to any netting-off of amounts owed to the Buyer per sub-Section (b)
below) by the Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds from an

Representative (each Stockholder shall be entitled to a pro rata portion of
the excess amount based on the determination of the Stockholders\'
Representative);

  



  

(b) the Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital and/or the
Cash is less than the Estimated Cash and/or the Estimated Indebtedness is more

the Stockholders, and the Buyer shall have the amount of the deficiency
(subject to any netting-off of amounts owed to the Stockholders per sub-
Section (a)) paid at Buyer's discretion by wire transfer of immediately
available funds from each Stockholder to Buyer pursuant to written
instructions provided by the Buyer (each Stockholder being required to
contribute pro rata based on the determination of the Stockholders\'
Representative _or_ from the Escrow Amount to Buyer and the
Stockholders shall be required to pay into the Escrow Account the amount of
such deficiency within ten (10) Business Days. If the amount of the
deficiency (subject to any netting-off of amounts owed to the Stockholders per
sub-Section (a)) exceeds the Escrow Amount, then such excess amount shall be
paid by Stockholders by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Buyer.

  



  

Any payments payable under this Section shall be payable within five (5)
Business Days of the agreement or the determination of the Closing Calculation
as provided herein. For the avoidance of doubt: (1) the Closing Calculation

Buyer shall not be entitled to claim or recover any Losses or any other form
of price adjustment post-Closing in respect of such matters (even if any
Losses exceed the relevant amount provided in respect of the Fixed Priced
Matter) and (2) the Closing Calculation shall reflect the provisions made in
respect of the Variable Priced Matters and the Buyer shall have the right to
seek recovery in respect of any provisions at Closing that exceed the amount
provided in respect of the Variable Priced Matters and the Sellers have the
right to be compensated in the event that the provisions at Closing in respect
of the Variable Priced Matters are below the amount provided in respect of
the Variable Priced Matters.

10.2 _Indemnification Procedures_. Claims for indemnification under this
Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

  



  

(a) A party claiming indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnified Party") with
respect to any Third-Party Claim that could give rise to a right of
indemnification hereunder shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days of written notice of such Third-Party Claim) (i) notify the
party from whom indemnification is sought (such notified party, the
"Indemnifying Party") of the Third-Party Claim, and (ii) transmit to the
Indemnifying Party a written notice (a "Claim Notice") describing
in reasonable detail the nature of the Third-Party Claim, a copy of all
papers served with respect to such Claim (if any), the basis of the
Indemnified Party's request for indemnification hereunder and a good-faith
estimate of the amount of Damages attributable to such Claim. Failure to
provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified
Party's indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

  



  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to elect to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim at its own expense
provided it makes such election within thirty (30) days after receipt of any
Claim Notice with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party who is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, by all appropriate
proceedings. If the Indemnifying Party irrevocably agrees that the Third
Party Claim involves Damages entitled to be indemnified, all costs of such
defense or any settlement by the Indemnifying Party, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, accountants' fees and any other reasonable fees and expenses
related to such defense, shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 10, be indemnifiable Damages.

  



  

(c) The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof, provided that
the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the entry of a judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the matter without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). If an Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any amount required to be paid by
the Indemnified Party that exceeds, where the Indemnified Party has withheld
or delayed consent in connection with the proposed compromise or
settlement of a Third-Party Claim, the amount for which that Third-Party
Claim could have been settled pursuant to that proposed compromise or
settlement (provided that (i) such final compromise or settlement is on
substantially the same terms (other than the monetary amount) as the proposed
compromise or settlement where the Indemnified Party has withheld or delayed
such consent, or (ii) any final judgment in such matter is for a larger
monetary amount), unless the Indemnified Party has withheld or delayed its
consent due to the proposed compromise or settlement requiring payment by the
Indemnified Party or a finding or admission by the Indemnified Party of any
violation of Legal Requirements, breach of any contract, any violation of any
rights of any Persons, or against its own legitimate commercial interests. No
Third-Party Claim that is being defended in good faith by the Indemnifying
Party shall be settled or compromised by the Indemnified Party without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

   

47 
--- 

 


--- 

   



  

(d) Notwithstanding any dispute as to liability as between any parties
hereunder, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
shall act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or
otherwise dealing with any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall
(in addition to, and not in limitation of, its obligation to act in good
faith), at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third-Party
Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of
any related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third-Party Claim
or any cross complaint against any Person and making available to the
Indemnifying Party all witnesses, records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Party's possession or under its control (or in the possession or
control of any of its Affiliates or Representatives) relating to the Third-
Party Claim as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party or its
counsel.

  



  

(e) The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Third-Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Section 10.2, and the Indemnified Party shall bear its
own costs and expenses with respect to such participation; provided, however,
if in the opinion of counsel of the Indemnified Party there is a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable costs and expenses of one counsel
to the Indemnified Party in connection with such defense.

  



  

(f) If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) Business Days after receipt of any Claim Notice that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
10.2, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, at, subject to
the limitations of this Section 10 and the last sentence of this Section 10.2,
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third-Party Claim by
all appropriate proceedings. The Indemnified Party shall have full control of
such defense and proceedings and the Indemnifying Party will be bound by any
compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim made by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Section 10.2, and the Indemnifying Party shall bear
its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to (or is deemed to have elected not to) assume
the defense of a Third-Party Claim, or elects to assume the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, but reserves the right to dispute whether such Claim is an
indemnifiable Damage hereunder, the determination of whether the Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be resolved either by the
parties hereto as provided herein.

  



  

   

48 
--- 

 


--- 

   



  

(g) With respect to any indemnification sought by an Indemnified Party from
the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly provide written notice to the Indemnifying
Party of any Claim with respect to which the Indemnified Party believes it is
or may be entitled to indemnification hereunder and in any event within forty-
five (45) days of the Indemnified Party becoming aware that it is going to
make a Claim (an "Indemnity Notice"). The Indemnity Notice shall describe in
reasonable detail the nature of the Claim, the Indemnified Party's best
estimate of the amount of Damages attributable to such Claim (the "Claimed
Amount") and the basis of the Indemnified Party's request for indemnification
hereunder.

  



  

(h) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within
thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Indemnity Notice that the
Indemnifying Party disputes such Claim (the "Dispute Notice") in which the
Indemnifying Party (i) agrees that part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount
is owed to the Indemnified Party (the "Agreed Amount") or (ii) asserts that no
part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnified Party (any part of the
Claimed Amount that is not agreed by the Indemnifying Party to be owed to the
Indemnified Party pursuant to the Dispute Notice (or the entire Claimed Amount
if the Indemnifying Party asserts that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed)
shall be referred to as the "Contested Amount"), the Indemnifying Party shall
be deemed to have accepted and agreed with such Claim. Subject to Schedule
4A, the Indemnifying Party shall pay within forty-five (45) days of the
receipt of the Indemnity Notice the Agreed Amount.

  



  

(i) If the Indemnifying Party has disputed a Claim for indemnification
(including any Third-Party Claim), the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution to such dispute.
If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to resolve
such dispute regarding a Contested Amount within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Dispute Notice, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance
with Section 12.1.

  



  

(j) This Section 10.2 shall be without prejudice to paragraphs 3 and 4 of
Schedule 4A and the terms of the Insurance Policies.

  



  

10.3 _Limitation on Liability and Liability Amounts_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

  



  

(a) (i) the Institutional Stockholder shall not be obligated to indemnify any
Buyer Indemnified Party and (ii) Buyer shall not be obligated to
indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party, unless and until the aggregate
Damages suffered by all Buyer Indemnified Parties or by all the
Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, that would otherwise be
subject to indemnification hereunder, exceeds the Tipping Basket Threshold
Amount set out in Schedule 4A, and then such Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification for all Damages, including the Tipping Basket
Threshold Amount; and

  



  

   

49 
--- 

 


--- 

   



  

(b) No Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for indemnifying any
Indemnified Party for any individual Claims or series of related Claims under
this Agreement where the Damages relating thereto are in the aggregate less
than the Tipping Basket Threshold Amount set out in Schedule 4A, and such
items shall be aggregated for purposes of Section (a) above.

  



  

10.4 _Calculation and Characterization of Damages_.

  



  

(a) For purposes of calculating Damages and for determining whether a breach
has occurred under Section 10.1, any Representation and Warranty
Qualification, or similar limitation or qualification contained in the
representations and warranties will be ignored and disregarded. For
the avoidance of any doubt, with respect to any claim for indemnification
relating to a breach (or alleged breach) of a representation or warranty that
may only be considered breached if the defect, inaccuracy, mistake or
misrepresentation is material or outside of the Knowledge of the Selling
Parties, the materiality of such defect, inaccuracy, mistake or
misrepresentation, or absence of Knowledge, will not be considered for
purposes of determining whether a breach of such representation and warranty
has occurred or in determining the amount of the Damages arising out of such
breach.

  



  

(b) In calculating the amount of the Damages to any Indemnified Party
hereunder, the amount of Damages will be net of any actual amounts
recovered by the Indemnified Party from any third party (including insurance
proceeds) as a result of the facts or circumstances giving rise to the
Damages.

  



  

10.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing, except for any equitable
relief to which any party hereto may be entitled or in the case of
actual fraud, the indemnification provisions of this Section 10 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all Claims relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement and no party shall pursue or seek to pursue
any other remedy.

  



  

10.6 _Mitigation of Damages_. The parties hereto shall cooperate with each
other to mitigate any Damages.

  



  

10.7 _Certain Damages_. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING UNDER THIS SECTION 10) OR THE TERM
"DAMAGES" COVER OR INCLUDE CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR ANY DAMAGES BASED ON
ANY TYPE OF MULTIPLE, WHETHER BASED ON STATUTE, TORT OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER
OR NOT ARISING FROM THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY'S SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT.

  



  

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event a third party seeks or obtains
consequential, incidental, special, indirect or punitive Damages or lost
profits from a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party, such
Damages shall, to the extent they would otherwise be indemnifiable under this
Agreement but for the fact that they are consequential, incidental, special,
indirect or punitive Damages, be direct Damages to such Buyer Indemnified
Party or Seller Indemnified Party and indemnifiable under this Agreement.

  



  

   

50 
--- 

 


--- 

   



  

10.8 Stockholders' disclosure of any liability shall not serve to relieve
Stockholders of any indemnity liability or obligation hereunder.

  



  

10.9 _Invalidity of Exculpatory Statements or Disclosure._ Stockholders shall
not be relieved of any liability hereunder as a result of the disclosures of
such potential liability. The Institutional Stockholder\'s indemnity
obligations shall remain in full force and effect even if Stockholders have
directly or indirectly disclosed the potential for liability.

  



  

10.10 _Inventory_. On or after the last day of the 23rd month following
Closing (the "Inventory Date") the Buyer shall procure that an inventory
count is carried out in order to quantify the Schlecker Inventory which is
still held at 17.00 p.m. (local time) on the Inventory Date ("Inventory
Valuation"). The Buyer shall (i) procure that the Inventory Valuation is
consistent with IFRS, including as to valuation, and (ii) promptly provide
the result of the Inventory Valuation and any supporting documents reasonably
requested by the Institutional Stockholder in respect thereof. The Buyer will
ensure that (A) the Schlecker Inventory will be utilized to satisfy
obligations under the Schlecker contract in preference to other inventory
using first-in, first-out principles, and (B) in the event the relevant
contractual commitments with Schlecker are terminated, to the extent any
Schlecker Inventory still exists, the Buyer will procure that commercially
reasonable efforts are made to sell such Inventory.

  



  

11\. RETURN OF RESTRICTED CASH

  



  

At the termination, renewal and/or expiry of the relevant leases entered into
by the Group that relate to the Restricted Cash, the Buyer will notify the
Institutional Stockholder of such fact. Buyer shall procure that upon any
Restricted Cash being released, surrendered, utilized or otherwise returned
to the Group (in any form), it shall promptly notify the Institutional
Stockholder (or its nominees) and pay the relevant amount to the
Institutional Stockholder (or its nominees) as soon as possible and, pending
any payment to Institutional Stockholder (or its nominees), procure that such
monies are held on trust for the Institutional Stockholder (or its nominees).

  



  

12\. MISCELLANEOUS.

  



  

12.1 _Dispute Resolution_.

(i) intentionally do or say anything which is harmful to, or with the
intention of harming the reputation of, the Buyer's Group, the Group or any
part thereof; or (ii) save in his role (if any) as a director and/or employee

Group, the Group or any part of either of them (as the case may be) but would
be adjudged reasonable if any part of the wording of the provision were
deleted or limited in a particular manner, the provision shall apply with

the obligations in this Section 12.3 is separate and severable and shall be
construed and be enforceable independently of the others. Without prejudice to
any other remedy which may be available to the Buyer, the parties agree the
Buyer shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in
