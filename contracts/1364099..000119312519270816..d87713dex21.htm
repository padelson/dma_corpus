thereunder or related thereto will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each Party submits for itself and its

relating to the Debt Financing, the Company further agrees that it shall not bring or support any action, cause of action claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in Law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against any Financing Source, in any way relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, but for the avoidance of doubt, other than any definitive
