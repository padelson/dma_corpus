ARTICLE II

 

THE MERGER

2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, (a) Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company; (b) the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease; and (c) the
Company will continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent. The Company, as the surviving corporation of the
Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation."

2.2 _The Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will cause the Merger to be consummated pursuant to the DGCL by filing
a certificate of merger in customary form and substance (the "Certificate
of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as
may be agreed in writing by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and specified
in the Certificate of Merger, being referred to herein as the "Effective
Time").

 

2.3 _The Closing_. The consummation of the Merger will take place at a closing
(the "Closing") to occur at (a) 9:00 a.m., Eastern time, at the offices of
Baker Botts L.L.P., 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, NY 10112 (provided that
the Closing may take place by conference call and electronic delivery (e.g.,
email/.pdf) of signatures), on a date to be agreed upon by Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company that is no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than
those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of
such conditions);  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Marketing Period has
not commenced or ended at the time of satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such
conditions), the Closing shall instead occur on the earlier of (i) a date
during (or prior to the commencement of) the Marketing Period specified by
Parent on no less than three (3) Business Days notice to the Company and (ii)
the third (3rd) Business Day after the end of the Marketing Period (subject
in each case to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth
in _Article VII_ at such time); or (b) such other time, location and date as
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company mutually agree in writing. The date on
which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the "Closing Date."

2.4 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
will be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time all (a) of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving
Corporation; and (b) debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Second Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the
"Charter"), will be amended and restated in its entirety to read substantially
identically to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that all references in the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub (i) to its name, date of
incorporation, registered office and registered agent shall instead refer to
the name, date of incorporation, registered office and registered
agent, respectively, of the Company as provided in the Charter immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) naming the incorporator(s), the initial
board of directors, or original subscribers for shares of Merger Sub shall be
omitted) and such amended and restated certificate of incorporation will
become the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until,
subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, thereafter amended in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and such certificate of
incorporation.

 



16

    

(b) _Bylaws_. The Parties shall take all necessary action such that, at the
Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will be amended and
restated in their entirety to read substantially identically to the bylaws of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until, subject
to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, thereafter amended in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

 

2.6 _Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) _Directors_. The Parties shall take all necessary action such that the
directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be installed as, from and after the Effective Time, the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified.

(b)  _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be installed as, from and after the Effective Time, the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are
duly appointed.

 

2.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any securities or other capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company,
the following will occur:

 



     | (i) |

each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and thereupon each
certificate representing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger
Sub will thereafter represent ownership of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation; 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting Company
Shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to $32.00, without interest thereon (the "Per Share Price"), and
shall no longer be outstanding as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.11_; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as treasury
stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub; or (C) owned by any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Owned Company Shares") will be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration
paid therefor. 

---|---|--- 

(b) _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price will be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with
respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this clause (b) shall
be construed to permit any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted
by any other provision of this Agreement.

 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.



     | (i) |

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the 

---|---|--- 
 



17

         |  Effective Time and held by a Company Stockholder who shall have
neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal
in respect of such share of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Company Shares") will not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_, but instead shall entitle the holder thereof only to
such rights as may be granted to a holder of Dissenting Company Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any
Dissenting Company Share held by any Company Stockholder who shall have failed
to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its
rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Share pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL will thereupon (A) be deemed no longer to be a Dissenting Company
Share and (B) be treated as if it had been converted into, and become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per
Share Price, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common
Stock in the manner provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.10_.  
---|--- 



     | (ii) |

The Company will give Parent (A) prompt written notice (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) of any demands for appraisal received by the
Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company
Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and Legal
Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
may not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any
such demands for payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares, or agree to
do any of the foregoing. For purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.7(c)(ii)_,
"participate" means that Parent will be kept reasonably apprised of proposed
strategy and other significant decisions with respect to demands for appraisal
pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares (to the extent
that the attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not
undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or
suggestions and participate in negotiations with respect to such demands but
will not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such
demands except for the payment, settlement or compromise consent set forth
above. 

---|---|--- 
 

2.8 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, all Company Stock Options that are outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall immediately
vest (if unvested), and shall cease to represent a right to acquire Company
Common Stock. Each Company Stock Option that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented a right to acquire Company Common Stock shall
be converted automatically into the right to receive (without interest), as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a cash payment equal
to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the per
share price of such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company Stock Option, less
applicable Tax withholdings; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance
of doubt, if the per share exercise price of any such Company Stock Option is
greater than or equal to the Per Share Price, such Company Stock Option shall
be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time without any cash payment
being made or other consideration provided in respect thereof.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the restrictions on each share of
Company Restricted Stock granted and then outstanding shall, without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
lapse, and each such share of Company Restricted Stock will be treated at the
Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to the
same conditions as, a share of Company Common Stock not subject to any
restrictions, subject to any withholding Taxes required by law to be withheld.

 



18

    

(c) As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU that is outstanding
and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled as of
the Effective Time and converted into a right to receive (without interest),
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, a cash payment in
an amount equal to the Per Share Price for each share of Company Common Stock
covered thereby, subject to any withholding Taxes required by law to be
withheld.

 

(d) As of the Effective Time, each Company Performance Share that is
outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted into a right to receive
(without interest), as soon as reasonably practical after the Effective Time,
a cash payment in an amount equal to the Per Share Price for each share
of Company Common Stock covered thereby, with the number of shares covered by
an award of Company Performance Shares to be equal to the greater of (1) the
number determined in accordance with the performance criteria as otherwise
provided in the applicable award agreement and as if the performance period
ended as of the last Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date and
(2) the target award level as provided in the applicable award agreement, plus
the amount of any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents associated with
such Company Performance Share, subject to any withholding Taxes required by
law to be withheld.

 

(e) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, at all times from and
after the Effective Time, maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy their
obligations to holders of Company Equity Awards pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 2.8_.

 

(f) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the later of the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter or the
Companys next regularly scheduled payroll payment date, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation (or, as applicable, its relevant Subsidiary) to pay
through its payroll system to each applicable holder of a Company Equity
Award, such amount due and payable to such holder pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.8(a)_ in respect of such Company Equity Award.

 

2.9 _Further Actions_. The Company will, prior to Closing, take all action
necessary to effect the cancellation, conversion and vesting, as applicable,
of Company Equity Awards upon the Effective Time and to give effect to
_Section_ __ _ 2.8_ (including cancellation of each Company Stock Option with
a per share exercise price greater than or equal to the Per Share Price for
no consideration and the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e)
promulgated under the Exchange Act). Except as otherwise mutually agreed by
the Parties as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.8_, the Company shall, prior to
Closing, take all actions necessary or appropriate so that all Company Equity
Awards and all Company Equity Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time
and following the Effective Time, no participant in any Company Equity Plan
or other Employee Plan will have any right thereunder to acquire any equity
securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.

 

2.10 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Company Stockholders to
receive the Per Share Price to which they have become entitled pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_ (the "Payment Agent"); and (ii) enter into a payment
agent agreement, in customary form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with such Payment Agent. The Company will reasonably cooperate with
Parent with respect to providing any information requested by the Payment
Agent in connection with fulfilling its responsibilities pertaining to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause
to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate
consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment
Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations
of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or

 



19

    

 instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the
United States with a maturity of no more than thirty (30) days; (ii)
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively; or (iii)
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available)
and, in any case of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), no such
instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months (such cash and any
proceeds thereon, the "Exchange Fund"). To the extent that (A) there are any
losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent
to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.7_; or (C)
all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the
Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.7_ for any reason, Parent will, or will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of
cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the
payments contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Any income from investment of
the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
Parent directs. Any amounts made available to the Payment Agent pursuant to
this Agreement to pay for any shares that are Dissenting Company Shares shall
be returned to Parent on demand.

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, and in any
event not more than five (5) Business Days thereafter, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of
record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate
or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company
Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the "Certificates"); and (ii)
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock that represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned
Company Shares) (the "Uncertificated Shares") (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form and reasonably acceptable to the Company (which will specify
that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Price payable in respect
thereof pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Subject to _Section_ __ _
2.10(g)_, upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, together with such
other documents and information as may reasonably be requested by the Payment
Agent, the holders of such Certificates will be entitled to receive, and the
Payment Agent shall promptly pay, in exchange therefor, an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per
Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect
thereof), and the Certificates so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled.
Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.10(g)_, upon receipt of an "agents message" by
the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be
entitled to receive, and the Payment Agent shall promptly pay, in exchange
therefor, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
holders transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per Share Price (less
any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The
Payment Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated
Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per
Share Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.10(c)_. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and
after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share
Price, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no holder of Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a
Certificate or an executed letter

 



20

    

 of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_.

 

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will
cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the Depository
Trust Company ("DTC") with the objective that the Payment Agent will transmit
to DTC or its nominees to the extent practicable and without duplication of
any other payments to be made by the Payment Agent or otherwise pursuant to
this Agreement, on the first (1st) Business Day after the Closing Date an
amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal to (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company Shares
and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (ii) the Per Share
Price.

 

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in
which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered or transferred in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered or
transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company
only if, in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a
Certificate, such Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper
form for surrender and transfer or, in the case of Uncertificated Shares, a
proper transfer instruction (together with any other documentation or
information reasonably requested by Parent or the Payment Agent) is presented
that is satisfactory to each of Parent and the Payment Agent, and, in the case
of shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares, the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent
(or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered
holder of such shares, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been
paid or are otherwise not payable.

 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective
Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their
Certificates (or otherwise complied with _Section_ __ _ 2.12_ in the case of
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates) or Uncertificated Shares representing
such shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 2.10_ will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in
respect of such shares of Company Common Stock solely to Parent (which shall
remain responsible for payment of the Per Share Price in respect thereof,
subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), solely as general
creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders
may be entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such holders two (2) years after the Effective Time, or at such
earlier time as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts
would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Authority, will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest
of any such holders (and their successors, assigns or personal
representatives) previously entitled thereto.

2.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after
the Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be converted or cancelled and retired, as
applicable in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, and cease to exist; and
(b) holders of each Certificate or Uncertificated Share theretofore
representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to

 



21

    

 have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per
Share Price payable therefor in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.7_, or in
the case of Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.7(c)_. The Per Share Price paid in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, there will be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures,
trades effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with
the exchange procedures of _Section_ __ _ 2.10(c)_) be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 

2.12 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Payment Agent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will pay to such Person the Per
Share Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.7_; _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the
Person claiming such Certificates to be lost, stolen or destroyed to deliver a
bond in customary form in such amount as it may reasonably determine as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

2.13 _Withholding_ _Rights_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company and the Surviving Corporation (and their Affiliates and
Representatives) will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts
payable in connection with this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any applicable Laws. To the
extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

2.14 _No Dividends or Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on
or after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

 

2.15 _Necessary Further Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of
the Company and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
take all such lawful and necessary action.

with respect to a section or subsection in this Agreement only to the extent
that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure in such Recent
SEC Report that it is applicable to such section or subsection of
this Agreement; and

 



22

Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

3.1 _Organization; Good Standing_. The Company (a) is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing pursuant to the DGCL; and
(b) has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as
it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties
and assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification
necessary (to the extent that the concept of "good standing" is applicable in
the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of the Charter and the Amended and Restated
Bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws"), each as amended to date. The Company is
not in violation of the Charter or the Bylaws.

 

3.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. The Company has the requisite corporate
power and authority to (a) execute and deliver this Agreement; (b) perform
its covenants and obligations hereunder; and (c) subject only to receiving the

delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of
its covenants and obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the
Transactions (including the Merger) have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company and no additional corporate
actions on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize (i) the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company; (ii) the performance
by the Company of its covenants and obligations hereunder; or (iii) subject
only to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the consummation
of the Transactions (including the Merger). This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability (A) may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally; and (B) is
subject to general principles of equity (the "Enforceability Limitations").

 

3.3 _Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws_.

 

(a) _Company Board Approval_. The Company Board (at a meeting or meetings duly

the performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations
hereunder, and the consummation of the Transactions (including the Merger)

(b) _Fairness Opinion_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company
Board has received the written opinion (or an oral opinion to be confirmed in
writing) of Lazard Freres and Co. LLC (the "Advisor") to the effect that, as of
the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the various
limitations, matters, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the
Per Share Price to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock (other than the
Owned Company Shares and the Dissenting Shares) pursuant to

 



23

    

 this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of
Company Common Stock (it being understood and agreed that such written opinion
is for the benefit of the Company Board and may not be relied upon by Parent
or Merger Sub).

(c) _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company Board has taken all necessary actions
so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of
the DGCL and any other similar applicable "anti-takeover" Law will not be
applicable to the Merger or this Agreement. No other state takeover statute
or similar statute or regulation applies to the Merger or the other
Transactions.

3.4 _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. The affirmative vote of the holders of
a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock entitled to vote on the Merger (the "Requisite Stockholder Approval") is
the only vote of the holders of any class or series of Company Capital Stock
that is necessary pursuant to applicable Law, the Charter or the Bylaws to
adopt this Agreement and consummate the Merger.

 

3.5 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder, and the consummation of the Transactions (including the Merger) do
not (a) contravene, violate or conflict with any provision of the Charter or
the Bylaws; (b) contravene, violate, conflict with, result in the breach of,

of termination or acceleration pursuant to, any Material Contract or any
Material Lease; (c) assuming that all Consents described in _Section_ __ _
3.6(i)_ through  _(iii)_ have been obtained or made, and any waiting periods

case of the consummation of the Merger, subject to obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, violate or conflict with any Law applicable to the
Company Group or by which any of their respective properties or assets are
bound; or (d) result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted Liens)
upon any of the properties or assets of the Company Group, except in the case
of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) for such violations, conflicts, breaches,
defaults, terminations, accelerations or Liens that would not be material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. 

3.6 _Requisite Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, filing or registration with, or notification to (any of the
foregoing, a "Consent") any Governmental Authority is required on the part of
the Company in connection with (a) the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company; (b) the performance by the Company of its covenants

Laws, including compliance with any applicable requirements of the Exchange

with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, each as in effect on the date that such Company SEC Report

filing prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of such amended or
superseded filing), each Company SEC Report did not contain, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters received

3.10 _Company Financial Statements; Internal Controls; Indebtedness_.

 

(a) _Company Financial Statements_. The consolidated financial statements
(including any related notes and schedules) of the Company Group filed with
the Company SEC Reports (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as
may be indicated in the notes thereto or as otherwise permitted by Form 10-Q
with respect to any financial statements filed on Form 10-Q); and (ii) fairly
present (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and subject in the
case of unaudited statements to normal, year-end audit adjustments), in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company Group as
of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended. There are no unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the
Company or any off-balance sheet arrangements of the type required to be
disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC
that have not been so disclosed in the Company SEC Reports.

 

(b) _Disclosure Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established and
maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined pursuant to Rule
13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act). The
Companys disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to
ensure that all (i) material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports and other documents that it files or furnishes pursuant
to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC; and (ii) such
material information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(c) _Internal Controls_. The Company has established and maintains a system
of "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined pursuant to Rule
13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act) sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with GAAP, including policies and procedures that require the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company Group; (ii) that
transactions are made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of
the Companys management and the Company Board (or a committee thereof); and
(iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of the assets of the Company Group. The Companys
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2018, and such assessment concluded that such system was effective. Since
January 1, 2017, the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of the Company have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor its principal executive officer or
principal financial officer has received notice from any Governmental
Authority challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or
manner of filing of such certifications. Neither the Company nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, the Companys independent registered public
accounting firm has identified or been made aware of (A) any significant
deficiency or material weakness in the system of internal control over
financial reporting utilized by the Company Group that has not been
subsequently remediated; or (B) any fraud that involves the Companys
management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial

functions: (A) disrupting, disabling, harming, or otherwise impeding in
any material manner the operation of, or providing unauthorized access to, a

(c) _No Audits_. No audits or other examinations or claimed deficiencies with
respect to any material amounts of Taxes of the Company Group are presently
pending or in progress or have, since January 1, 2017, been asserted or
proposed in writing. No written claim has ever been made by a Governmental
Authority in a jurisdiction where the Company Group does not file a Tax
Return that a member of the Company Group is or may be subject to material
amounts of tax in that jurisdiction that would be the subject of such Tax
Return other than any such claims that have been fully resolved or for which
adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP in the
Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof.

(d)  _Spin-offs_. The Company Group has not constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution of

any Person other than the Company Group pursuant to Treasury Regulation §
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or non-United States Law)
as a transferee or successor, or otherwise by operation of law.

 

(g) _Liens and Certain Tax Matters._ There are no Liens in respect of material
Taxes on any of the assets of the Company Group. No member of the Company
Group will be required to include any material item of income in, or exclude
any material item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period
ending after the Closing Date as a result of any prepaid amount, installment
sale, or other transaction on or prior to the Closing, any accounting method
change, use of an improper method of accounting, or agreement with a
Governmental Authority used or made prior to the Closing, or any intercompany
transaction or excess loss account described in Section 1502 of the Code
entered into or existing prior to the Closing.

(h)  _Miscellaneous_. As of the Closing Date, no member of the Company Group
that is organized outside the United States will hold any material assets that
constitute U.S. property within the meaning of Section 956 of the Code. No
member of the Company Group has any material obligation or liability with
respect to the unlawful receipt of any grants, subsidies, state aid or similar
amounts. No member of the Company Group has any material amounts due and owing
to any Governmental Authority under any applicable Law governing escheat and
unclaimed property.

and administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
with all applicable law, including the applicable provisions of ERISA, the

than routine claims for benefits that have been or are being handled through
an administrative claims procedure.

 

(e) _No Prohibited Transactions_. None of the Company Group, or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any of its directors, officers, employees or agents
has, with respect to any Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to any
fiduciary breach or non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section
4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) that could reasonably be expected
to result in the imposition of a material penalty assessed pursuant to Section
502(i) of ERISA or a material Tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code, in each
case applicable to the Company Group or any Employee Plan, or for which the
Company Group has any indemnification obligation.

 



33

    

(f) _No Additional Rights_. Except as set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 3.18(f)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter, none of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the consummation of the Merger or the Transactions will, either

Code.

 

(i) _International Employee Plans_. Each Employee Plan maintained for the
benefit of employees of the Company Group located outside of the United
States, other than statutorily-required plans sponsored or maintained by a
Governmental Authority (each such Employee Plan, an "International Employee
Plan") has been established, maintained and administered in compliance in all
material respects with its terms and conditions and in all material respects
with the requirements prescribed by any applicable laws. Furthermore, no
International Employee Plan has material unfunded liabilities that as of the
Effective Time will not be fully offset by insurance or fully accrued in
accordance with GAAP. With respect to each International Employee Plan: (i) if
required to have been approved by any non-U.S. Governmental Authority so as
to obtain any beneficial tax or other status, such International Employee Plan
has been so approved and no such approval has been revoked (nor, to the
Knowledge of Company, has revocation been threatened) and no event has
occurred since the date of the most recent approval or application therefor
that is reasonably likely to cause such revocation; (ii) except as provided
in  _Section_ __ _ 3.18(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no employees
of the Company Group (or any of their dependents) are entitled to any pension,
superannuation, retirement (including on early retirement) or death

is a "retirement compensation arrangement" (as such term is defined under the
Income Tax Act (Canada)).

3.18(j)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no Employee Plan or other
arrangement provides material post-termination or retiree life insurance,
health or other material welfare benefits to any Person, except as required by
Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or any similar state Law and at such
Persons sole expense. None of the Company Group has taken any action that
could reasonably be expected to cause the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Affiliates to have any legally binding obligation to provide post-retirement

(b) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as expressly permitted by this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3 _and except in respect of an Exempted Party (but only for
so long as such Person or group of Persons is an Exempted Party) until the
date which is fifteen (15) days after the No-Shop Period Start Date
(the "Cut-off Date"), from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company will and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their
officers and directors to, and will instruct and use its reasonable best

public information concerning the Company Group theretofore furnished to any
such Person with whom a confidentiality agreement was entered into within the
six (6) month period immediately preceding the No-Shop Period Start Date and

47

    

 agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an
Acquisition Transaction, an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"); or (E)
resolve or propose to do any of the foregoing. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company will enforce,
and will not waive or release, any provision of any standstill or
confidentiality agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , the Company will not be
required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive or release, any provision
of any standstill or confidentiality agreement solely to the extent that such
provision has the effect of prohibiting or purports to prohibit making a
confidential Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. For avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the Company and
its Representatives may, prior to the Cut-off Date, continue to engage in the

immaterial, unintentional breach) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, (i) the
Company and its Representatives may contact the Person or group of
Persons making the Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof or to request that any Acquisition Proposal made orally be
made in writing; and (ii) if such Acquisition Proposal is in writing and the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (x) such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (y) the Company
Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take the following actions would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable
law, then the Company and the Company Board may, directly or indirectly
through one or more of their Representatives (including the Advisor), (A)
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group
of Persons making the Acquisition Proposal and its or their Representatives
regarding such Acquisition Proposal and (B) enter into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group of Persons making such
Acquisition Proposal and (subject to such Person or group of Persons having
entered into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) furnish, or provide
access to, pursuant to such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement any non-
public information relating to the Company Group or its businesses,
properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or provide
access to any personnel of the Company Group; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide to Parent
any non-public information concerning the Company Group that is provided to
any such Person or group of Persons or its or their Representatives that was
not previously provided to Parent. In no event may the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives directly or indirectly reimburse
or pay, or agree to reimburse or pay, the fees, costs or expenses of, or

Acquisition Agreement_. Except as provided by _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_, at no
time after the date of this Agreement may the Company Board (or a committee
thereof):

withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub in any respect; (B)
adopt, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an
Acquisition Proposal; (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within seven (7) Business Days after Parent so requests in 

---|---|--- 
 



48

         |  writing, which request is transmitted after any public
disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that the Company will have
no obligation to make such reaffirmation on more than two separate occasions
with respect to a particular Acquisition Proposal); (D) take or fail to take
any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public
statement in connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than
a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen"

Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or
any substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the tenth (10th)
Business Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered
a violation of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_); or (E) fail to include the
Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in
clauses (A) through (E), a "Company Board Recommendation Change"); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) the
determination by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; or (2) the delivery by
the Company to Parent of any notice contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_,
in each case so long as the Company or the Company Board does not
intentionally issue any public statement to such effect, will in and of itself
constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change; or 
---|--- 



     | (ii) |

cause or permit the Company Group to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement. 

---|---|--- 
 

(e) _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval:



     | (i) |

to any material event, development, discovery, change or circumstance with
respect to the Company that (A) was not known to, or reasonably expected by,
the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement; and (B) does not relate to
(x) any Acquisition Proposal; or (y) the mere fact, in and of itself, that

estimates or predictions of revenue, earnings or other financial or operating
metrics for any period ending on or after the date of this Agreement, or
changes after the date of this Agreement in the market price or trading volume
of the Company Common Stock or the credit rating of the Company (an
"Intervening Event") (it being understood that the foregoing clause (y) will
not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any event, development,
discovery, change or circumstance underlying such fact or changes referred to
in clause (y) has resulted in or contributed to an Intervening Event), if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law and if and only if: 

---|---|--- 



     | (1) |

the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five (5)
Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board has (A) so
determined; and (B) intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)(i)_, which notice will specify the
applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (2) |

prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company and
its Representatives, during such five (5) Business Day period, must have (A)
negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent
that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (together with any corollary adjustments to the
terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters and/or Guarantee) so that the
Company Board would no longer determine that the failure to make a Company
Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties pursuant 

---|---|--- 
 



49

         |  to applicable law; and (B) permitted Parent and its
Representatives an opportunity to make a presentation to the Company Board
regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto proposed by
Parent (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation);
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event of changes in the circumstances
giving rise to such Intervening Event, the Company will be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)(i)(2)_ with respect to such new written notice
(except that the above-referenced five (5) Business Day period in respect of
such new written notice shall be three (3) Business Days); or 
---|--- 



     | (ii) |

if the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, whether during
the Go-Shop Period or after the No-Shop Period Start Date, that the Company
Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal and which
did not result from any breach (other than an immaterial, unintentional
breach) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, then the Company Board may (A) effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; or (B) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal, in each case if and only if:  

---|---|--- 



     | (1) |

the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; 

---|---|--- 



     | (2) |

the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; 

---|---|--- 



     | (3) |

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least four (4)
Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period"), which notice shall state (A)
that the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that has not
been withdrawn and that the Company Board has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
constitutes a Superior Proposal; (B) to the extent not previously provided to
Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(f)_, the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person or group of Persons making
such Acquisition Proposal and copies of all material documents relating to
such Acquisition Proposal; and (C) that the Company Board intends to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)(ii)_ absent revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such
Company Board Recommendation Change or termination; and (ii) prior to
effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company
and its Representatives, during the Notice Period, must have (1) negotiated
with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement (together with any corollary adjustments to the terms and
conditions of the Commitment Letters and/or Guarantee) so that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; and (2)
permitted Parent and its Representatives an opportunity to make a presentation
to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect
thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation);
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event of any revisions to the financial
terms or any other material term or condition of such Acquisition Proposal,
the Company will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to
comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)(ii)(3)_ with
respect to such new written notice (except that the Notice Period in respect
of such new written notice shall be three (3) Business Days); and 

---|---|--- 



     | (4) |

in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or permit
the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect

Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_, including paying (or
causing to be paid) the Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 8.3(b)(iii)_.

(f) _Notice_. On the No-Shop Period Start Date in respect of each Exempted
Party, the Company will notify Parent in writing of, and from the No-Shop
Period Start Date until the earlier to occur of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company will
promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours thereafter) notify Parent in
writing of, (i) the receipt by the Company or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, its Representatives of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
non-public information; (ii) the identity of the Person or group of Persons

Acquisition Proposal or request for non-public information made in writing and
any other written terms and proposals provided (including financing

request not made in writing. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent
reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt basis, of the status
and supplementally provide any change to the terms of any such Acquisition
Proposals (including as required by clauses (i) through (iv) above and any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

 

(g) _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company
or the Company Board from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act,

order to comply with applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule, it
being understood that any such statement or disclosure made by the Company
Board pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(g)_ must be subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and will not limit or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) and
the rights of Parent under this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, it being understood
that nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the
Company Board to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change other than in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_. In addition, it is understood and
agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement, a factually accurate public
statement by the Company or the Company Board that only describes the
Companys receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal, the material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto and is
otherwise permitted pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, will not
be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change.

(h) _Breach by Representatives_. The Company agrees that any action taken by
any of its Representatives that, if taken by the Company, would be a breach
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, will be deemed to be a breach of this _Section_
__ _ 5.3_ by the Company.

(b) _No Failure to Take Necessary Action_. In addition to the foregoing,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including subject to
clause (D) of the second sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_), neither Parent
or Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, will take

6.2 _Antitrust Filings_.

 

(a) _Filing Under the HSR Act and Other Applicable Antitrust Laws_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall, and in the case of Parent and Merger Sub shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, to the extent required in the reasonable judgment of counsel to

cause its respective Affiliates to cooperate and coordinate) with the other in
the making of such filings; (B) supply the other (or cause the other to be
supplied) with any information that may be required in order to make such

the Transactions, then such Party will make (or cause to be made), as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other Parties, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. The parties to this
Agreement shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, take
any action with the intention to, or that would reasonably be expected to,
hinder or delay the expiration or termination of any waiting period under the
HSR Act or the obtaining of approval of the FTC and DOJ as necessary. 

 



52

    

(b) _Divestitures_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if
and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the Transactions pursuant
to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Transactions,
each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective
controlled Affiliates (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include the
Company and its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing) to, (i) offer,
negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order,
settlement, undertaking, stipulation or otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture,
license or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other
equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or intangible), rights,
products or businesses of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective
controlled Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company Group,
on the other hand; (B) the termination, amendment or assignment of existing
relationships or contractual rights or obligation of Parent and Merger Sub
(and their respective controlled Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand,
and the Company Group, on the other hand; (C) the change or modification of
any course of conduct regarding future operations of Parent and Merger Sub
(and their respective controlled Affiliates), on the one hand, and the Company
Group, on the other hand; and (D) any other restrictions on the activities of
Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective controlled Affiliates,
if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company Group, on the other hand,
with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their respective
businesses, assets or rights or interests therein (each of the actions in the
foregoing clauses (A) through (D), a "Regulatory Condition"); and (ii)
contest, defend and appeal any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, brought or threatened to be brought by any Person (including
any Governmental Authority) under applicable Antitrust Laws in order to avoid
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted or terminated, any order of any kind or
nature that would prevent the consummation of the Transactions from occurring
prior to the Termination Date. Except as expressly provided for under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_, and except that any actions may be conditioned upon the
consummation of the Closing, all such efforts shall be unconditional and shall
not be qualified in any manner and no actions taken pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a
Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected
to occur. If any Regulatory Condition agreed to by Parent requires action by
or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses
or assets, and such action would constitute a breach of this Agreement, Parent
hereby consents to the taking of such action by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent required by such Regulatory Condition.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event will
Parent or Merger Sub be obligated pursuant to this Agreement to, and the
Company will not without the written consent of Parent, sell, divest, license
or hold separate any capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses, or to take
or commit to take any action, unless the consummation of such transaction or
effectiveness of such action is conditioned upon the Closing.

(c)  _Cooperation_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) and Parent and Merger
Sub shall (and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates to), subject
to any restrictions under applicable Laws, (i) promptly notify the other
parties hereto of, and, if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or,
in the case of oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any
material communication received by such Person from a Governmental Authority
in connection with the Transactions and permit the other parties to review and
discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the
other parties in relation to) any proposed draft notifications, formal
notifications, filing, submission or other written communication (and any
analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations, correspondence or other
documents submitted therewith) made in connection with the Transactions to a
Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably informed with
respect to the status of any such submissions and filings to any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions and any developments, meetings
or discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect thereof, including
with respect to (A) the receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent,
approval or waiver, (B) the expiration of any waiting period, (C) the
commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any investigation,
litigation or administrative or judicial action or proceeding under applicable
Laws and (D) the nature and status of any objections raised or proposed or
threatened to be raised by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions; and (iii) not independently participate in any meeting, hearing,
proceeding or discussions (whether in person, by telephone or

 



53

    

 otherwise) with or before any Governmental Authority in respect of the
Transactions without giving the other parties reasonable prior notice of such
meeting or discussions and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority,
the opportunity to attend or participate. However, each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub may designate any non-public information provided to any
Governmental Authority as restricted to "outside counsel" only and any such
information shall not be shared with employees, officers or directors or their
equivalents of the other party without approval of the party providing
the non-public information; _provided, however_ , that before sharing any
information provided to any Governmental Authority with another Party on an
"outside counsel" only basis each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may
redact any information (A) to remove references concerning valuation of the
Company, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, or (C) as
necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or
confidentiality concerns.

6.3 _Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings_.

 

(a) _Proxy Statement_. Promptly following the date of this Agreement (and in
any event within eighteen (18) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement), the Company will prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary proxy
statement (as amended or supplemented, the "Proxy Statement") relating to the
Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the Company
must include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement.

 

(b) _Other Required Company Filing_. If the Company determines or becomes
aware that it is required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement
with the SEC in connection with the Transactions pursuant to applicable Law
(such document, as amended or supplemented, an "Other Required Company
Filing"), then the Company will promptly prepare and file such Other Required
Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC and NASDAQ. The Company may not file the
Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without
first providing Parent and its Representatives a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, and the Company will give due consideration to
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent or
its counsel. On the date of filing, the date of mailing to the Company
Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting, neither the Proxy Statement nor any Other Required Company Filing
will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by
the Company with respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied
by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required
Company Filing will not, at the time that the Proxy Statement or such Other
Required Company Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 

(c) _Other Required Parent Filing_. If Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates determines that it is required to file any document
with the SEC in connection with the Transactions or the Company Stockholder
Meeting pursuant to applicable Law (an "Other Required Parent Filing"), then
Parent and Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to,
promptly prepare and file such Other Required Parent Filing with the SEC.
Parent and Merger Sub will cause, and will cause their respective Affiliates
to cause, any Other Required Parent Filing to comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules of the SEC. Neither Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their
respective Affiliates may file any Other Required Parent Filing (or any
amendment thereto) with the SEC without first providing the Company and its
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and Parent
will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested 

 



54

    

 thereto by the Company or its counsel. On the date of filing, the date of
mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of the
Company Stockholder Meeting, no Other Required Parent Filing may contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false
or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to any information supplied by the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Parent Filing.
The information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in any Other Required Parent Filings will not, at the time that such
Other Required Parent Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 

(d) _Furnishing Information_. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will furnish all information concerning it
and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may reasonably request
in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy
Statement and any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent
Filing. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any
information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, so that such
filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information will promptly
notify the other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing
describing such information will be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC
by the appropriate Party and, to the extent required by applicable Law or the
SEC or its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

(e) _Consultation Prior to Certain Communications_. The Company and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, without first
providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such written communication, and each Party will give due consideration to
all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the other
Party or their respective counsel.

(f)  _Notices_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any
amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any
receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, any
Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the
case may be; or (iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for
additional information in connection therewith.

 

(g) _Dissemination of Proxy Statement_. Subject to applicable law, the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that
it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the Proxy
Statement (including responding as promptly as practicable to any comments
made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statements); _provided_ , that the
Company shall not be required to mail the Proxy Statement prior to the date
that is thirty (30) days after the date hereof.

6.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting_.

 

(a) _Call of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the Company will take all action necessary in accordance with
applicable Law (including the DGCL), the Charter, the

 



55

    

 Bylaws and the rules of NASDAQ to (i) in consultation with Parent, establish
a record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting (and the Company will not
change the record date without the prior written consent of Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)) and commence
a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection
therewith as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement and (ii) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its stockholders (the "Company Stockholder Meeting"), in each case, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Company Stockholders, for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Company will not be required to convene and hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting at any time prior to the twentieth (20th) Business
Day following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company
Stockholders. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and unless there has been a
Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain (including to solicit proxies to obtain) the Requisite
Stockholder Approval as promptly as reasonably practicable, including making
the Company Board Recommendation and including the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, the adoption of this Agreement shall be the only matter (other than
matters of procedure (including, for the avoidance of doubt, a proposal to
approve the adjournment or postponement of the Company Stockholder Meeting for
any reason provided in clauses (i) through (iv) of  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(b)_)
and matters required by applicable Law to be voted on by the Company
Stockholders in connection with the adoption of this Agreement) that the
Company shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of the Company at
the Company Stockholder Meeting.

(b) _Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the Company from
postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting after consultation
with Parent if (i) there are holders of an insufficient number of shares of
the Company Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Company
Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting;
(ii) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder
Meeting by applicable Law or a written directive from the SEC; (iii) the
Company has notified Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ that the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 5.3(e)(ii)_ and the applicable notice period thereunder will not have
expired prior to the then-scheduled date and time of the Company Stockholder
Meeting; or (iv) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties not to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting or that such postponement or adjournment is required by
applicable Law in order to give the Company Stockholders sufficient time to
evaluate any information or disclosure or any amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement that the Company has sent to the Company Stockholders or
otherwise made available to the Company Stockholders by issuing a press
release, filing materials with the SEC or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in each case, any such postponement or adjournment shall only be for
the minimum amount of time reasonably necessary to resolve the matter giving
rise thereto. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, the Company will establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and
submit this Agreement and the Merger to its stockholders at the Company
Stockholder Meeting even if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has
effected a Company Board Recommendation Change.

6.5 _Financing_.

 

(a) _No Amendments to Commitment Letters_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy pursuant to, the Commitment Letters without the prior written consent
of the Company, if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i) reduce
the amount of the Equity Financing, or reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing below the amount necessary to consummate the Transactions, (ii)
impose new or additional conditions or other terms to the Financing,
or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of
the Financing, in a manner that would reasonably be

 



56

    

 expected to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger, or (iii) materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company (solely with respect to the Equity Commitment Letter), to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letters;
_provided_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, Parent may amend the Debt
Commitment Letter or definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing to
add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities who
had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement
and amend titles, allocations and fee arrangements with respect to the
existing and additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or
similar entities.

(b) _Equity Financing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange and obtain the
Equity Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Equity
Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts to:



     | (i) |

maintain in effect the Equity Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms

 applicable legal privileges (including attorney-client privilege) and
confidentiality obligations if so disclosed.

 

(e) _Alternative Debt Financing_. In the event any portion of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in the

Company of such event and the reasons therefor and use its reasonable best

document or instrument relating to the Debt Financing (other than customary
representation letters and authorization letters (including with respect to
the presence or absence of material non-public information and the accuracy
of the information regarding the Company Group contained in the disclosure and
marketing materials related to the Debt Financing)) will be effective until
the Effective Time, and the Company Group will not be required to take any

memoranda and high-yield offering prospectuses or memoranda prepared in
relation to the Debt Financing will contain disclosure reflecting the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries as the obligor. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_ will require (1) any officer or Representative of the
Company Group to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any other action
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ that could reasonably be expected to result
in personal liability to such officer or Representative; (2) the Company Board
to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto; (3) the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any persons who are directors, officers or employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents

by directors or officers continuing in their positions after the Effective
Time); or (4) legal counsel (other than local counsel) to the Company to
deliver any legal opinions in connection with the Debt Financing.

 

(c) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such
logos (i) are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or likely to
materially harm or disparage the Company Group or the reputation or goodwill
of the Company Group; and (ii) are used in connection with a description of
the Company, its business and products or the Merger.

(d) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose
such information to any Financing Sources or prospective financing sources and
other financial institutions and investors that may become parties to the Debt
Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in
connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their respective
counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (i) agree to be bound by the
Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto; or (ii) are subject to other
confidentiality undertakings reasonably satisfactory to the Company and of
which the Company is a beneficiary.

 

(e) _Reimbursement_. Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent will
reimburse the Company for any documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by the Company Group in
connection with the cooperation of the Company Group contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

(f) _Indemnification_. The Company Group and its Representatives will be
indemnified and held harmless by Parent from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys
fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
suffered or incurred by them in connection with their cooperation in arranging
the Debt Financing pursuant to this Agreement or the provision of information
utilized in connection therewith, except to the extent arising from (i)
inaccuracies in historical information furnished in writing by or on behalf of
the Company Group, including financial statements, solely to the extent such
inaccuracies would constitute a material breach of  _Section_ __ _ 3.9_ or
_Section_ __ _ 3.10_, or (ii) the willful misconduct, fraud or intentional
misrepresentation of the Company Group. Parents obligations pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(e)_ and this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(f)_ referred to
collectively as the "Reimbursement Obligations."

 

(g) _No Exclusive Arrangements_. In no event will the Guarantor, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (which for this purpose will
be deemed to include each direct investor in Parent or Merger Sub and the
Financing Sources or potential Financing Sources of Parent, Merger Sub and
such investors) enter into any Contract, arrangement or understanding (i)
awarding any agent, broker, investment banker or financial advisor any
financial advisory role on an exclusive basis; or (ii) prohibiting or seeking
to prohibit any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt
financing from providing or seeking

 



61

    

 to provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any Person, in
each case in connection with a transaction relating to the Company Group or in
connection with the Merger.

 

(h) _No Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree
that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing. If the
Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub will each continue to
be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ and subject to the requirements of _Section_ __ _
9.8(b)(ii)_ hereof being satisfied, to consummate the Merger.

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board (and any
committee empowered to take such action, if applicable) will (a) take all
actions within their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute or
similar statute or regulation (or, in the case of Section 203 of the DGCL,
the restrictions on "business combinations" contained therein) is or becomes
applicable to the Merger; and (b) if any "anti-takeover" statute or similar
statute or regulation (or, in the case of Section 203 of the DGCL, the
restrictions on "business combinations" contained therein) becomes applicable
to the Merger, take all action within their power to ensure that the Merger
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on the Merger.

6.8  _Access_. At all times during the period commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective
Time, the Company will afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable
access (under Company supervision) during normal business hours, upon
reasonable advance notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel
of the Company, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable
Law or regulation requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit
access to such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or
information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or any other legal privilege applicable to
such documents or information; (c) access (inconsistent with the level of
access provided prior to the date hereof) to a Contract to which the Company
Group is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant
to, or give a third Person the right to terminate or accelerate the rights
pursuant to, such Contract; (d) access would result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third Persons; or (e) such documents or information relate to
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, are reasonably pertinent to
any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand; or relate to,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, an Acquisition Proposal. Nothing in this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_ will be construed to require the Company Group or any of
its Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or
other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ will be conducted in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business
of the Company Group or create risk of damage or destruction to any property
or assets of the Company Group. Any access to the properties of the Company
Group will be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and
insurance requirements and will not (without the consent of the Company)
include the right to perform invasive testing or sampling of environmental
media. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply to
any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection
with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_. All requests for access pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.8_ must be directed to the General Counsel of the Company, or another person
designated in writing by the Company.

6.9 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company will take all actions necessary and
advisable to cause the Merger, and any dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the Merger by
each individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be
exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.10 _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

(a) _Indemnified Persons_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
to), from and after the Effective Time, honor and fulfill, in all

 



62

    

 respects, the obligations of the Company Group pursuant to any
indemnification agreements (including any indemnification provisions included
in any employment agreement) between a member of the Company Group and any of
their respective current or former directors or officers (and any person who
becomes a director or officer of the Company Group prior to the Effective
Time) (collectively, the "Indemnified Persons") for any acts or omissions by
such Indemnified Persons occurring prior to the Effective Time. In addition,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other
similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set
forth in the Charter, the Bylaws and the other similar organizational
documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as of the date of
this Agreement. During such six-year period, such provisions may not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the
beneficiaries thereof except as required by applicable Law.

 

(b) _Indemnification Obligation_. Without limiting the generality of the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, during the period commencing at the
Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law or pursuant to any indemnification agreements with, and the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational
documents of, the Company Group in effect on the date of this Agreement, each
Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including
attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or
compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding
arises, directly or indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly,
to (i) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, of an
Indemnified Person in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company Group or other Affiliates to the
extent that such action or omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred
prior to or at the Effective Time; and (ii) the Transactions, as well as any
actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect
thereto (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries by Parent or Merger Sub that is alleged to have
rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent),
except that if, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
6.10(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally
resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, (A) the Surviving
Corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the
Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing to control the defense
thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to
object to the Indemnified Persons entitlement to indemnification hereunder
with respect thereto, except to the extent it thereafter learns such Person is
not entitled to such indemnification); (B) each Indemnified Person will be
entitled to retain his or her own counsel (the reasonable fees and documented
expenses of which that are indemnifiable hereunder will be paid by the
Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to
control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) the Surviving
Corporation will advance all reasonable and documented fees and expenses
(including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified
Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding subject to indemnification
hereunder, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the
defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be
liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or
her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary
damages for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates will settle
or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification has been sought by
an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement,
compromise or consent includes an

 



63

    

 unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising
out of such Legal Proceeding to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Any
determination required to be made with respect to whether the conduct of any
Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be
made by independent legal counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which
counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees
and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to)
maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance ("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage,
conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of
the DandO Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __
_ 6.10(c)_, the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for
its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"). If
the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may (or if Parent requests,
shall) purchase a prepaid "tail" policy with respect to the DandO Insurance
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance carrier so long
as the annual cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium. If the Company purchases such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective
Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such "tail" policy
is in full force and effect and (ii) the obligations in the first sentence
hereof shall cease to apply.

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
in such consolidation or merger; (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person; or (iii) dissolves, then proper
provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_
may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the
prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person.
Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries
pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section_ __
_ 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are intended to be third
party beneficiaries of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, with full rights of
enforcement as if a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other
persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ will be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational
documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all
indemnification agreements entered into with the Company Group; or (iv)
applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

(f) _Joint and Several Obligations_. The obligations of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_ will be joint and several.

(g) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be
construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy, indemnification
agreement, certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational
document that is or

 



64

    

 has been in existence with respect to the Company Group for any of its
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ is not prior
to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or
agreements.

 

6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Employment; Benefits_. As of the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or
one of its Subsidiaries will continue to employ the employees of the Company
Group as of the Effective Time. For a period of not less than one (1) year
following the Effective Time (the "Continuation Period") the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) maintain for the benefit of each
Continuing Employee who is not a Represented Employee (as defined below) (i) a
base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than that provided to the
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) aggregate
annual cash bonus compensation opportunities that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to the Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) employee benefits
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to the
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that
"employee benefits" shall not include equity-based compensation, defined
benefit pension benefits, retiree health and welfare benefits and benefits
under any deferred compensation plan or program. With respect to each
Continuing Employee who is covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement
(each, a "Represented Employee"), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, continue to honor the Collective
Bargaining Agreements, in each case as in effect at the Effective Time, in
accordance with their terms (it being understood that this sentence shall not
be construed to limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
amend or terminate any such Collective Bargaining Agreement, to the extent
permitted by the terms of the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement and
applicable law). The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall be subject
to any applicable provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreements and
applicable law in respect of each such Represented Employee, to the extent the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ are inconsistent with or otherwise in
conflict with the provisions of any such Collective Bargaining Agreement or
applicable law.

(b) _Severance Programs_. For purposes of any Employee Plan set forth on 
_Section_ __ _ 6.11(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Closing shall
be deemed to constitute a "change in control," "change of control" or such
similar term. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor all
Employee Plans set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.18(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (including the Company Severance Plan) in accordance with their terms
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as provided
herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the later of the duration of the
Continuation Period or the remaining term of any individual employment,
severance or separation agreement in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to), provide
each Continuing Employee who suffers a termination of employment under
circumstances that would have given the Continuing Employee a right to
severance payments and benefits under the Company Groups severance policy or
individual employment, severance or separation agreement or other arrangement
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, that are listed on
_Section_ __ _ 6.11(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (each such listed
arrangement, a "Company Severance Plan") with severance payments and benefits
no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such Continuing
Employee under the applicable terms of the Company Severance Plan.

 

(c) _Annual Bonuses_. With respect to annual cash bonuses for the 2019
calendar year, as soon as practicable following the end of the 2019 calendar
year, but in no event later than March 15, 2020, the Company shall, or, if the
Effective Time has occurred, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, pay each Continuing Employee an annual cash bonus for the
2019 calendar year in an amount determined based on the level of attainment of
the applicable performance criteria under the bonus plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated in for the 2019 calendar year (with such
payouts determined in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice).
In the event the employment of any Continuing

 



65

    

 Employee is terminated by the Company (or, if the Effective Time has
occurred, the Surviving Corporation) following the 2019 calendar year (or, if
earlier, the Effective Time) and prior to the payment of the annual bonus for
the 2019 calendar year under circumstances entitling such Continuing Employee
to severance benefits under the Company Severance Plan (including such
Continuing Employees execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in
accordance therewith), such Continuing Employee will be entitled to an annual
bonus for the 2019 calendar year payable in the same manner and at the same
time as other bonuses for the 2019 calendar year are payable as described
above. In the event the Effective Time occurs after the 2019 calendar year and
before annual cash bonuses have been paid in respect of 2019 calendar year,
the Company Board shall, to the extent in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice, determine the level of performance achieved for
purposes of the payout of such bonuses in good faith based on the foregoing
principles (and, for the avoidance of doubt, without taking any discretionary
action to provide for bonuses in excess of the amount contemplated by the
terms of the annual bonus plan for 2019 as in effect on the date hereof, but
disregarding for this purpose any negative discretion except to the extent
exercised in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice)
and Parent shall cause the bonuses determined by the Company Board to be paid
in the ordinary course of business following the Closing. With respect to
annual cash bonuses for the 2020 calendar year, as soon as practicable
following the end of the 2020 calendar year and the determination of the
actual results with respect to any performance metrics for the 2020 calendar
year, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay each
Continuing Employee who remains employed by the Company Group and is otherwise
eligible for a cash payment under the terms of the bonus plan for the 2020
calendar year in which such Continuing Employee participated as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (if any), an annual cash bonus for the
2020 calendar year in an amount determined by the board of directors (or
similar governing body) of the Surviving Corporation or its designee in
good faith in accordance with the terms of the applicable bonus plan;
_provided_ that, if no bonus plan is adopted for 2020 prior to the Effective
Time (or such bonus plan is adopted in violation of _Section_ __ _ 5.2(i)_ of
this Agreement), then any obligation regarding the annual cash bonuses for
the 2020 calendar year shall have no force or effect other than the
requirements set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_.

 

(d) _New Plans_. To the extent that a new employee benefit plan is made
available to any Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time (each a
"New Plan"), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to be
granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company
Group prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant
(including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay
entitlement, but excluding for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan), except that such service need not be credited to the
extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In
addition, where applicable, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that: (i) at the Effective Time,
each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in each New Plan to the extent such waiting time was
satisfied under a similar Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the "Old Plans"), (ii) at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts to (and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to use
commercially reasonable efforts to) cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions or limitations and actively-at-work requirements of each New Plan
that is a group health plan to be waived or satisfied for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent waived or satisfied
under the analogous Old Plan as of the Effective Time and (iii) at the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause all
eligible expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Continuing Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance 

 



66

    

 and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(e) _Obligations of the Company Group._ Prior to the Closing, the Company
Group will use reasonable best efforts to satisfy all notice, consultation and
bargaining obligations with respect to the Transactions owed to its employees
or their representatives under applicable Law, Collective Bargaining
Agreements, or other Contracts. __

(f) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ will not be
deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) require
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to
continue any Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) establish, amend or modify any
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

 

6.12 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent will take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the failure by either
of them to perform and discharge any of their respective covenants,
agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

6.13  _Notification of Certain Matters_.

(a) _Notification by the Company_. At all times during the period
commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing
until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company will give prompt notice to

this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of
any failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such
untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_ to fail
to be satisfied at the Closing, except that no such notification will affect

forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties
under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement apply to any information provided to Parent pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.13(a)_.

Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect,
or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to
the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to
consummate the Merger set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _
7.3(b)_ to fail to be satisfied at the Closing, except that no such
notification will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty

consent of (and use their respective reasonable best efforts to consult with)
the other Parties before (a) participating in any media interviews; (b)
engaging in any meetings or calls with analysts, institutional investors or

Company Board Recommendation Change and made in compliance with _Section_ __ _
5.3_ and (y) Parent shall not be obligated to engage in such consultation
with respect to ordinary course communications to its Affiliates and its and
their existing or prospective investors and limited partners (in each case,

the foregoing, this _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ shall not apply to any press release
or other public statement made by the Company or Parent that is consistent

reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company will (a)
give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or

respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation. The Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement
regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement
regarding, any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has consented thereto in
writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
_provided_ that Parent shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement
that does not include a full release of Parent and its Affiliates or that
imposes any obligations (including any equitable relief) upon Parent or its
Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Company Group)). For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.15_, "participate" means, and the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure, that Parent will be
kept apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with
respect to the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the
attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not
undermined or otherwise affected), that Parent will be provided with
the reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all filings and responses
to be made by the Company in connection with such Legal Proceeding and that
Parent will be given the reasonable opportunity to provide, and may offer,

accordance with the DGCL.

 

6.19 _No Control of the Other Party_ __ _s Business_. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that the restrictions set forth in this Agreement are not intended
to give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other

which any such individual would be entitled to receive consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Per Share Price in respect of such
holders shares of Company Common Stock.

 

6.21 _Discharge of Indebtedness_. No less than two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall obtain from each lender or holder of
Indebtedness set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.10(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter (including the administrative agent under the Credit Facility) and
deliver to Parent a customary payoff letter signed by such lender or holder
(and administrative agent), (a) specifying all amounts of such Indebtedness
owed to such lender or holder, as well as any other amounts required to fully
pay off all of such Indebtedness on the Closing Date, and (b) agreeing that,
upon such lenders or holders receipt of the applicable payoff amount, (i)
all outstanding obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries arising under
or related to the applicable Indebtedness shall be repaid and discharged in
full (other than contingent indemnification obligations as to which no claim
has been made) and (ii) any Liens such lender or holder may have in connection
therewith shall be released.

 

6.22 _Certain Tax Matters_. On the Closing Date, the Company will deliver a
certification, in form and substance required by the Treasury Regulations
under Section 1445(b)(3) of the Code and reasonably acceptable to Parent, to
the effect that the Company is not and has not been within the applicable time
period a United States real property holding corporation within the
meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code, together with a duly executed
notice of such certification to the IRS. After the date of this Agreement, the
Company will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) (i) reasonably cooperate
with any reasonable request of Parent in connection with determining whether
any withholding Taxes are applicable to payments made in connection with this
Agreement, and determining the amount of any withholding Taxes applicable to
payments made in connection with this Agreement (including any such Taxes
imposed by taxing authorities in Brazil or China); and (ii) take such actions
as are reasonably requested by Parent to minimize such Taxes in connection
with the Transactions, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, as a result
of the Peoples Republic of China Administration of Taxation Circular 7 (2015)
or any similar or associated Laws.

(whether prior to or after the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval)
if the Effective Time has not occurred by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on April
20, 2020 (the "Termination Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Marketing Period shall have begun but not be completed by the Termination
Date, then Parent may elect to extend the Termination Date to the last day of
the Marketing Period; it being understood that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ will not be available to
(i) (1) Parent if the Company has the valid right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(i)_; or (2) the
Company if Parent has the valid right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_; and (ii) any Party whose action or failure to act
(which action or failure to act constitutes a breach by such Party of this
Agreement) has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, either (A)
the failure to satisfy the conditions to the obligations of the terminating
Party to consummate the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ prior to the
Termination Date or (B) the failure of the Effective Time to have occurred
prior to the Termination Date (it being agreed that Parent and Merger
Sub shall be a single Party for purposes of this clause (ii));

a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_,
except that if such breach is capable of being cured by the Termination Date,
Parent will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

written notice of such breach, delivered at least forty-five (45) days prior
to such termination, stating Parents intention to terminate this Agreement

that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

deliver prompt written notice thereof to the other Parties setting forth in
reasonable detail the provision of _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ pursuant to which this
Agreement is being terminated and the facts and circumstances forming the
basis for such termination pursuant to such provision.

(b)  _Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ will be effective immediately upon
the mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company or the delivery of
written notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. In the event of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, this
Agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party
(or any partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee,
Affiliate, agent or

 



73

    

 other representative of such Party) to the other Parties, as applicable,
except that _Section_ __ _ 4.15_, _Section_ __ _ 6.6(d)_,  _Section_ __ _
6.6(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.6(f)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.14_, this _Section_ __ _
8.2_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ and _Article IX_ will each survive the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding
the foregoing but subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_, nothing in this
Agreement will relieve any Party from any liability for any willful breach of
this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful breach" means a
material breach of this Agreement that is the consequence of an act or
omission by a Party with the actual knowledge or intention that the taking
of such act or omission, or the making of a representation or warranty, would
constitute a material breach of this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing,
no termination of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any
Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement or the Guarantee, which
rights, obligations and agreements will survive the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.

 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions will be paid
by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is
consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment Agent. Parent
will pay or cause to be paid (i) all fees for filings required to be made
under any Antitrust Laws pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ and (ii) all
transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees and all sales, use,
real property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees, in each case that are
required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Companys
Subsidiaries arising out of or in connection with the consummation of the
Merger (but in all cases excluding any direct or indirect income, capital
gains or similar Taxes payable in connection with the this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger, whether payable directly or via withholding on
amounts payable in connection with this Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger). With respect to the preparation and filing of Tax Returns as related
to the foregoing Taxes, Parent and the Company Group shall cooperate with each
other and provide such documents and assistance as may be necessary to
prepare all Tax Returns and, following the Closing, Parent shall timely file
such Tax Returns.

(b) _Company Payments_.



     | (i) |

If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.1(c)_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_; (B) following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_
or _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, an Acquisition Proposal for an Acquisition
Transaction has been publicly announced or disclosed and not withdrawn or
otherwise abandoned; and (C) within one (1) year following the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, as applicable, either an Acquisition Transaction
is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing
for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not such
Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated), then the Company will
substantially concurrently with the earlier of the execution of such
definitive agreement or the consummation of such Acquisition Transaction, pay
(or cause to be paid) to Parent (or its equity holders in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(iv)_) an amount equal to $20,600,000 (the "Company
Termination Fee"); _provided_ , that if Parent has previously been paid the
Parent Expenses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(v)_, the amount of the
Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(i)_
shall be reduced by the amount of such Parent Expenses actually paid to
Parent. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(i)_, all references to
"25%" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" will be deemed to be
references to "50%." 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(f)_,
then the Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business
Days) following such termination, pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent (or its
equity holders in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(iv)_) the Company
Termination Fee.  

---|---|--- 
 



74

         | (iii) |

If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(h)_,
then prior to or concurrently with such termination the Company shall pay (or
cause to be paid) to Parent (or its equity holders in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(iv)_) the Company Termination Fee; _provided,_ that if
such termination occurs prior to the Cut-off Date and the Company has entered
into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement to consummate an
Acquisition Transaction with a Person or group of Persons that is an
Exempted Party at the time of such termination, then the "Company Termination
Fee" shall mean an amount equal to $10,300,000. 

---|---|--- 



     | (iv) |

The Parties agree that, to the extent the Company is required to pay the
Company Termination Fee in an amount that exceeds Parent and Merger Subs
expenses or out of pocket costs incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the Transactions, such excess ("Holder Damages") represents an amount of
damages payable in respect of losses suffered by the direct or indirect
equity holders of Parent. Accordingly, in the event a Company Termination Fee
is payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, Parent shall in its
discretion determine the extent, if any, to which such fee constitutes Holder
Damages, and the Company shall pay such Holder Damages for the account of such
direct or indirect equity holders of Parent to one or more (but in no event
more than five (5)) accounts specified in writing by Parent.  

---|---|--- 



     | (v) |

If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(d)_ or Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, then
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days)
following delivery by Parent to the Company of a written statement setting
forth the amount of such Parent Expenses, pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent
the Parent Expenses. 

---|---|--- 
 

(c) _Parent Payments_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.1(g)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(i)_, then Parent must
promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following such
termination pay to the Company an amount equal to $40,000,000 in cash (the
"Parent Termination Fee").

(d) _Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages_. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that in no event will the Company or Parent be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than
one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination
Fee, as applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of
this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of
different events. The Parties agree that each of the Company Termination Fee,
the Parent Termination Fee and the Parent Expenses constitutes liquidated
damages and not a penalty. In no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Parent Expenses on more than one occasion.

 

(e) _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are an integral part of the Merger, and that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ or Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_ and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a Legal
Proceeding that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ or any portion thereof or a judgment against
Parent for the amount set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_ or any portion
thereof, as applicable, then the non-paying Party will pay or cause to be paid
to the other Party its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection
with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion
thereof at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date that such payment
or portion thereof was required to be made through the date that such payment
or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate that is the
maximum permitted by applicable law. All payments under this _Section_ __ _
8.3_ to be made by the Company to Parent shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Parent, and all payments under this

 



75

    

  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ to be made by Parent to the Company shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the Company.

 

(f) _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.



     | (i) |

Under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages and any other
amounts payable by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for breaches
(including willful breach) under this Agreement, the Guarantee or the Equity

amount of the Parent Termination Fee, plus (y) up to an additional $4,000,000
in the aggregate in respect of all of the Reimbursement Obligations and any
costs, interest and expenses in connection with a Legal Proceeding payable

including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of
the Parent Liability Limitation against Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor or
in any case against the other Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to,
this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Guarantee or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including, any breach by the
Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub), the termination of this Agreement, the
failure to consummate any of the Transactions or any claims or actions under
applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Other
than the Guarantors obligations under the Guarantee and the
Equity Commitment Letter, other than the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement and other than the
obligations of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates to the
extent expressly provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, in no event will
any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than the Guarantor, Parent
and Merger Sub have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or any
other Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions. 

---|---|--- 



     | (ii) |

the extent owed pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, plus, to the extent
applicable, any costs, interest and expenses in connection with a Legal

and (B) collectively, the "Company Related Parties") in respect of this
Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the
failure to consummate any of the Transactions or any claims or actions under
applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Upon
payment to Parent, or its direct or indirect equity holders pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(iv)_, of the Company Termination Fee, plus, to the
extent applicable, up to $4,000,000 in respect of any costs, interest and
expenses in connection with a Legal Proceeding payable pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.3(e)_, (1) none of the Company Related Parties will have any further
liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, any agreement 

---|---|--- 
 



76

         |  executed in connection herewith or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis of such
termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will
remain obligated with respect to, and Parent and the Company Group may be
entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, _Section_
__ _ 6.6(e)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.6(f)_,  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)_, _Section_

in the event the Company Termination Fee plus, to the extent applicable, such
costs and expenses are received by Parent, or its direct or indirect equity
holders pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)(iv)_, Parent and Merger Sub shall
not have, and each expressly waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy
or recourse (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at Law
(including at common law or by statute) or in equity). For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Agreement (including this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_)
shall relieve the Company from any liability for willful breach in any
circumstance in which this Agreement has been terminated and the Company
Termination Fee is not paid in full (but with the amount of any such
liability not to exceed the Company Liability Limitation). 
---|--- 



     | (iii) |

Under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages and any other

obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary
recovery or monetary award (including for willful breach) (A) in excess of

the Company Related Parties other than the Company, and in no event will
Parent, Merger Sub or the Parent Related Parties be entitled to seek or
obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including consequential, special,
indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Company Liability Limitation
against the Company or in any case against the other Company Related Parties
for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Transactions, the termination
of this Agreement, the failure to consummate any of the Transactions or any
claims or actions under applicable law arising out of any such breach,
termination or failure. Other than the obligations of the Company to the
extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in no event will any Company
Related Party or any other Person other than the Company have any liability
for monetary damages to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions. 

---|---|--- 



     | (iv) |

The Companys receipt of the aggregate amount of the Parent Termination Fee,
to the extent owed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(c)_, plus, to the extent
applicable, the Reimbursement Obligations and any costs, interest and expenses
in connection with a Legal Proceeding payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.3(e)_, will be the maximum amount of monetary damages that the Company
Group may recover from the Parent Related Parties in respect of this
Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the
failure to consummate any of the Transactions or any claims or actions under
applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure. Upon
payment to the Company of the Parent Termination Fee, plus, to the extent
applicable, up to

have any further liability or obligation to the Company relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis
of such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain
obligated with respect to, and Parent and Merger Sub may be entitled to
remedies with respect to, _Section_ __ _ 8.3(e)_); and (2) none of the
Company Group or any other Person will be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim, action or proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Related
Party arising out of this Agreement, any agreement executed in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or
any matters forming the basis for such termination (except that the Parties
(or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and Parent and
Merger Sub may be entitled to remedies with respect to, _Section_ __ _ 8.3_)
and, in the event the Parent Termination Fee plus, to the extent applicable,
such costs and expenses are received by the Company, the Company shall not
have, and expressly waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy or
recourse (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at Law
(including at common law or by statute) or in equity). For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Agreement (including this  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_)
shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub from any liability for willful breach in
any circumstance in which this Agreement has been terminated and the Parent
Termination Fee is not paid in full (but with the amount of any such
liability not to exceed the Parent Liability Limitation). 
---|--- 

(g) _Acknowledgement Regarding Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)_, it is agreed that Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company will be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief as provided in, and subject to the

limitations of, _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_, under no circumstances will the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both specific performance of the
type contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_ and the Parent Termination Fee or
any other monetary damages.

Company Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of its
Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or
obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award against any Parent Related

to this Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter or the Guarantee or the
Transactions (including any breach by the Guarantor, Parent or Merger Sub),

expressly provided for in the Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter; or
(ii) from any Person that is party to, and solely pursuant to the terms and
conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(i) _Non-Recourse Company Party_. In no event will Parent or Merger Sub or
any Parent Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of its

9.6_, _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, _Section_ __ _ 9.11_ and this _Section_ __ _
8.4_ (and the defined terms therein and any provision of this Agreement to the
extent an amendment, modification or alteration of such provision would

to the Financing Sources) may not be amended, modified or altered without the
prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

of the Financing Sources. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such

this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right.

8.6 _No Liability of Financing Sources_. None of the Financing Sources will
have any liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at law
or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and none of the Company Group

or thereunder; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ shall
limit the rights of the Company and its Affiliates from and after the
Effective Time under any debt commitment letter or the definitive
debt documents executed in connection with the Debt Financing (but not, for
the avoidance of doubt, under this Agreement) to the extent the Company and/or
its Affiliates are party thereto.

such assignment will not (i) affect the obligations of the parties (including
the Financing Sources) to the Equity Commitment Letter or the Guarantor
pursuant to the Guarantee; or (ii) impede or delay the consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise impede the rights of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and
will inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. No assignment by any Party will relieve such Party of any
of its obligations hereunder.

9.4 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that One Rock Capital Management, LLC and the Company have previously executed
a Confidentiality Letter Agreement, dated June 10, 2019 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), that will continue in full force and effect in accordance with
its terms. Except as set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Representatives will hold and treat all documents and
information concerning the Company Group furnished or made available
to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives in connection with
the Transactions in accordance with

 



80

    

 the Confidentiality Agreement. By executing this Agreement, each of Parent
and Merger Sub agree to be bound by, and to cause their Representatives to be
bound by, the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement as if
they were parties thereto.

9.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and
other agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter, constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be
superseded; (b) survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in
full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the
date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its
terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

9.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.6(f)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ and this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_, the Parties
agree that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set
forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is
not intended to, and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by _Section_
__ _ 6.6(f)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.10_; and (b) from and after the Effective
Time, the rights of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Equity Awards to receive the merger consideration set forth in _Article II_.
The provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.3(f)(i)_, _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, _Section_
__ _ 8.5_, Section __ _ 8.6_, _Section_ __ _ 9.10_, _Section_ __ _ 9.11_
and this _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ will inure to the benefit of the Financing
Sources and their successors and assigns, each of whom are intended to be
third party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and agreed that the
provisions of such Sections will be enforceable by the Financing Sources and
their respective successors and assigns).

 

9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

9.8 _Remedies_.

 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance and monetary damages (including the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee), under no circumstances will the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing and monetary
damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific performance and
all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee).

 

(b) _Specific Performance_.



     | (i) |

The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the
Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any Party
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_, subject to  

---|---|--- 
 



81

         |   _Section_ __ _ 8.6_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)(ii)_, (A) the
Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity, to seek an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; (B) the
provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are not intended to and would not
adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any
respect any Partys right to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent
would have entered into this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide
any proof of an inadequate remedy at law or any bond or other security in
connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably
waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or other security. 
---|--- 



     | (ii) |

The Parties agree not to raise any objections as to the availability,
unenforceability or adequacy of remedies to (A) the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the
specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants, obligations and agreements of the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, pursuant to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that the Company shall not be
entitled to any injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief or
remedy to enforce the obligation of Parent or Merger Sub to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded or to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger or the other Transactions, including to effect the Closing in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, unless and until (i) all conditions in
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied or waived
(subject to  _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ and other than those conditions that by
their terms are to be satisfied at Closing, _provided_ that such conditions
are satisfied at Closing) at the time when the Closing would have been
required to occur, (ii) the financing provided for by the Debt Commitment
Letter (including any alternative financing that has been obtained in
accordance with, and satisfies the conditions of, _Section_ __ _ 6.5(e)_) has
been funded or will be simultaneously funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing, (iii) the Company has irrevocably notified
Parent in writing after the expiration of the Marketing Period that all
conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ have been satisfied or waived
and the Company is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and (iv)
Parent and Sub fail to complete the Closing on the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3_. 

---|---|--- 

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

 

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to
the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether
inside or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any
Legal Proceeding relating to the Transactions, for and on behalf of itself or
any of its properties or assets, in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ or
in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable law, and nothing in
this _Section_ __ _ 9.10_ will affect the right of any Party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by applicable law; (ii) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits itself and its

 



82

    

 properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) (the
"Chosen Courts") in the event that any dispute or controversy arises out of
this Agreement, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court; (iv)
agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement,
the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will be
brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such
Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was
brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;
and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this
Agreement, the Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in
any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen
Courts shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

 

(b) _Jurisdiction for Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i)
that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to,
the Debt Financing or the performance of services thereunder or related
thereto will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of Manhattan and any
appellate court thereof, and each Party submits for itself and its property
with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or
support anyone else in bringing any such Legal Proceeding in any other
court; (iii) that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in
any applicable debt commitment letter will be effective service of process
against them for any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court; (iv) to
waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal
Proceeding in any such court; and (v) any such Legal Proceeding will be
governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of
laws of another jurisdiction. Without limiting the obligations of the
Financing Sources to Parent and Merger Sub under the Debt Commitment Letter
and other agreements relating to the Debt Financing, the Company further
agrees that it shall not bring or support any action, cause of action claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in Law or
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Source, in any way relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, but
for the avoidance of doubt, other than any definitive agreements executed in
connection with the Debt Financing or the performance thereof.

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
NEGOTIATION, VALIDITY OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE MERGER, IS
LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH
OF CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE GUARANTEE, THE EQUITY
COMMITMENT LETTER, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE EQUITY FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY
SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES IN CONNECTION WITH THE
FINANCING DESCRIBED IN THIS AGREEMENT). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS

 



83

    

 REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
9.11_.

 

9.12 _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The Parties agree that the
disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the
corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only
if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

 

9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same
agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar
attachment to email (any such delivery, an "Electronic Delivery"), will be
treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart
and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were
the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise
the use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through
the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a
contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except to the extent
such defense relates to lack of authenticity. 

9.14 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent
possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given
to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and
closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative and
that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this
Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect and nothing set
forth in any provision herein will in any way be deemed to limit the scope,
applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.

 

9.15 _Performance Guarantee_. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and
faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of the
obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of Merger Sub under
this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, including any such
obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings that are required
to be performed, discharged or complied with following the Effective Time by
the Surviving Corporation.
