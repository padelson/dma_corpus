add any contract, agreement or lease entered into by Seller or the High Plains

Purchased Contracts and included in the Purchased Assets. All Purchased
Contracts that are so removed from Schedule 1.1(d) in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement shall, for all purposes of this
Agreement, thereafter be deemed to be Excluded Assets and shall cease to be
Purchased Contracts and shall no longer be included in the Purchased Assets.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, updates to Schedule 1.1(d) in

condition to the obligations of Buyer to consummate the Closing or the
satisfaction thereof.

bonuses and other compensation payable by Seller or any High Plains Entity in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not constitute Assumed Obligations.

  

  

(b) Except for the Assumed Obligations, Buyer does not assume, and will not be
deemed by the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby to have assumed, any other liabilities or
obligations of Seller or relating to the Purchased Assets, of any kind or
nature, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, or whether due or
to become due, or otherwise, whether known or unknown, arising out of events,
transactions or facts which shall have occurred, arisen or existed on or
before the Effective Time, which liabilities and obligations, if ever in
existence, shall continue to be liabilities and obligations of Seller and the
High Plains Entities including any and all liabilities and obligations of or
on behalf of Seller and the High Plains Entities for Taxes in respect of
taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Effective Time
and those relating to the Excluded Assets or for borrowed money, including any
liability of infringement, misappropriation or other conflict with the
Intellectual Property of any third party arising on or before the Effective
Time (the "Retained Obligations"). Seller shall timely perform and discharge
in accordance with their respective terms all Retained Obligations. For
purposes of clarity, and not in limitation of the foregoing, Seller shall be
solely responsible for any forfeitures, fines and other payments
(collectively, "Fines") imposed by the FCC in connection with the Business'
operations prior to the Closing Date whether such Fines are imposed by the FCC
in connection with a Renewal Application (as defined below) or otherwise and
regardless of whether such Fines are imposed before or after the Closing Date.

  

  

1.4 Purchase Price

  

  

. In consideration for the sale of the Purchased Assets, Buyer shall, at the
Closing, in addition to assuming the Assumed Obligations, pay to Seller the
sum of $225,536,000.00 (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment as
provided in this Agreement. The Purchase Price shall be paid at Closing by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account(s) designated by
Seller.

  

  

1.5 Escrow Deposit

  

  

. Upon execution and delivery of this Agreement and pursuant to the terms and
conditions of an Escrow Agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") among Buyer, Seller
and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the "Escrow Agent"), Buyer shall deposit in escrow
with the Escrow Agent in cash an amount equal to $22,553,600.00 (the "Escrow
Deposit") to be held by the Escrow Agent in an escrow fund (the "Escrow
Deposit Fund") pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Deposit Fund shall be released to Seller in accordance
with Section 10.5 hereof and to Buyer in accordance with Section 10.6 hereof.
At the Closing, the Escrow Deposit Fund and all interest on, or other proceeds
(the "Earnings") of, the Escrow Deposit Fund shall be applied toward the
Purchase Price. The parties agree that any Taxes related to the Earnings shall
be paid by Buyer. On the Closing Date, the Escrow Deposit Fund and any
Earnings shall be disbursed to Seller and applied to the Purchase Price.

  

  

1.6 Prorations and Adjustments

  

  

.

  

  

(a) All income and expenses arising from the Business, including Assumed
Obligations and prepaid expenses, ad valorem and property taxes and
assessments (but excluding Seller's and the High Plains Entities' Accounts
Receivable), annual regulatory fees payable to the FCC, power and utilities
charges, and rents and similar prepaid and deferred items shall be prorated
between Seller and Buyer in accordance with the United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") to reflect the principle that Seller
shall be entitled to all income and be responsible for all expenses arising
from the Business through the Effective Time and Buyer shall be entitled to
all income and be responsible for all expenses arising from the Business after
the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Seller will credit to Buyer the economic value of all accrued and unused
vacation time (but not sick leave) that Buyer credits to the Transferred
Employees (as defined below) in accordance with Section 5.6, where economic
value is the amount equal to (i) the cash compensation that would be payable
to each such Transferred Employee at his or her level of compensation on the
Closing Date for a period equal to such accrued and unused vacation time plus
(ii) the employer's share of any related Taxes, including FICA taxes and
unemployment taxes.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.6 to the contrary, (i) except
as set forth herein, with respect to Trade Agreements (as defined below) for
the sale of time for goods or services assumed by Buyer, if at the Effective
Time, the Trade Agreements have an aggregate negative balance (i.e., the
amount by which the value of air time the Stations are obligated to provide
after the Effective Time exceeds the fair market value of corresponding goods
and services to be received by the Stations after such date), there shall be
no proration or adjustment, unless the absolute value of the aggregate
negative balance of the Stations' Trade Agreements together with the absolute
value of the aggregate negative balance of the Little Rock Stations' Trade
Agreements (as that term is defined in the Mission Agreement) exceeds
$100,000, in which event only such excess shall be treated as prepaid time
sales of the Stations, and adjusted for as a proration in Buyer's favor, and
(ii) there shall be no proration under this Section 1.6 to the extent there is
an aggregate positive balance with respect to the Stations' Trade Agreements.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Trade Agreement" means any contract,
agreement or commitment, oral or written, other than film and program barter
agreements, pursuant to which Seller or any High Plains Entity has agreed to
sell or trade commercial air time or commercial production services of a
Station in consideration for any property or service other than cash.

  

  

(d) There shall be no proration under this Section 1.6 for Program Rights
agreements except to the extent that any payments or performance due under
such Program Rights agreements relate to a payment period that straddles the
Effective Time in which case the amount payable in the payment period will be
prorated based on the number of days in such period. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Program Rights" means all rights of the Stations to broadcast
television programs or shows as part of the Stations' programming, including
all rights of the Stations under film and program barter agreements, sports
rights agreements, news rights or service agreements, affiliation agreements
and syndication agreements.

  

  

(e) The prorations and adjustments to be made pursuant to this Section 1.6 are
referred to as the "Closing Date Adjustments." At least five (5) business days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall estimate all Closing Date Adjustments
pursuant to this Section 1.6 and shall deliver a statement of its estimates to
Buyer, which statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for
those estimates. At the Closing, the net amount due to Buyer or Seller as a
result of the estimated Closing Date Adjustments shall be applied as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, as appropriate. Within sixty (60) days after
the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement of any adjustments to
Seller's estimate of the Closing Date Adjustments, and no later than the close
of business on the tenth (10th) day after the delivery of such statement (the
"Payment Date"), Buyer shall pay to Seller, or Seller shall pay to Buyer, as
the case may be, any amount due as a result of the adjustment (or, if there is
any good faith dispute, the undisputed amount). During the first sixty (60)
days after Closing, each of Buyer and Seller agrees to provide representatives
of the other party with prompt reasonable access to its related books, records
and employees during regular business hours (or in lieu of such access, copies
of reasonably requested materials and telephonic access to such employers
shall be provided upon two (2) business days' prior written notice to such
party) for the purpose of preparing the statement of adjustments to Seller's
estimate of the Closing Date Adjustments, all substantially in accordance with
the procedures and practices applied by Seller's business offices.

  

  

(f) Except with respect to items that Seller notifies Buyer that it objects to
prior to the close of business on the date that is at least one (1) business
day prior to the Payment Date, the adjustments set forth in Buyer's statement
shall be final and binding on the parties effective at the close of business
on the Payment Date. If Seller disputes Buyer's determinations set forth in
Buyer's statement or Buyer disputes Seller's determinations set forth in any
such objection notice, the parties shall consult with regard to the matter and
an appropriate adjustment and payment shall be made as agreed upon by the
parties within thirty (30) days after the Payment Date. If such thirty (30)
day consultation period expires and the dispute has not been resolved, then
the parties shall retain a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized
independent accounting firm that does not then have a relationship with Seller
or Buyer (the "Independent Accountant"), to resolve the disagreement and make
a determination with respect thereto as promptly as practicable. The
determination by the Independent Accountant on the matter shall be binding. If
an Independent Accountant is engaged pursuant to this Section 1.6, the fees
and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be borne by Seller and Buyer
in inverse proportion as such parties may prevail on the resolution of the
disagreement which proportionate allocation also will be determined by the
Independent Accountant and be included in the Independent Accountant's written
report, and an appropriate adjustment and payment shall be made within three
(3) business days of the resolution by the Independent Accountant, which
resolution the parties will request the Independent Accountant to render
within thirty (30) days after such retention.

  

  

1.7 Allocation

  

  

. All amounts constituting consideration within the meaning of and for the
purposes of Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") and the regulations thereunder shall be allocated among the Purchased
Assets and any other rights acquired by Buyer hereunder, as applicable, in the
manner required by Section 1060 of the Code. Prior to or promptly after the
Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall provide information to the other
regarding the providing party's proposed allocation of the Purchase Price and
any Assumed Obligations in accordance with the requirements of Section 1060 of
the Code, and, if the parties reach agreement with respect to such allocation,
then each party agrees to complete and timely file IRS Form 8594 (or any
successor form), to file all income Tax Returns in accordance with such agreed
allocation, and to take no action inconsistent with such agreed allocation. If
the parties do not reach agreement with respect to such allocation, then the
parties shall have no further obligation under this Section 1.7 and each party
shall make its own determination of such allocation for financial and Tax
reporting purposes.

  

  

1.8 Closing

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Subject to any prior termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1, the consummation of the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets
pursuant to this Agreement and the assumption of the Assumed Obligations (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP at
100 Federal Street, Floor 34, Boston, Massachusetts 02110 on the fifth (5th)
business day after the latest of (i) the date upon which the FCC Consent (as
defined below) shall have been granted and shall be in full force and effect
and shall have become a Final Order (as defined below), (ii) the date the HSR
Clearance (as defined below) occurs, (iii) the conclusion of the Marketing
Period (as defined below) (the "Closing Date"), and (iv) December 1, 2012,
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Closing set forth
herein, or on such other date or at such other location as is mutually
agreeable to Buyer and Seller; provided, however, that Buyer in its sole
discretion and upon at least ten (10) days prior written notice to Seller may
waive the requirement that the FCC Consent become a Final Order, in which
event, the date described in clause (i) above will be the date upon which
public notice of the grant of the FCC Consent is made by the FCC and the
parties will in good faith negotiate a form of unwind agreement relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Unwind Agreement") and execute and
deliver such Unwind Agreement at Closing. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Final Order" means an Action (as defined below) by the FCC (i) that has not
been vacated, reversed, stayed, enjoined, set aside, annulled or suspended;
(ii) with respect to which no request for stay, motion or petition for
rehearing, reconsideration or review, or application or request for review or
notice of appeal or sua sponte review by the FCC is pending; and (iii) as to
which the time for filing any such request, motion, petition, application,
appeal or notice, and for the entry of orders staying, reconsidering or
reviewing on the FCC's own motion has expired.

  

  

(b) The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing
Date" and, in respect of each Station 12:01 a.m. local time for such station
on the Closing Date is referred to herein as the "Effective Time"; provided,
however, that with respect to those certain Purchased Contracts relating to
advertising time on the Stations, the Effective Time shall be deemed to be
5:00 a.m., local time, on the Closing Date.

  

  

1.9 Governmental Consents

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Within five (5) business days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and
Seller shall file one or more applications with the FCC (the "FCC
Application") requesting FCC consent to the assignment of the FCC Licenses to
Buyer. FCC consent to the FCC Application with respect to those FCC Licenses
set forth on Schedule 1.9(a) (the "Primary FCC Licenses") without any material
adverse conditions other than those of general applicability is referred to
herein as the "FCC Consent." Buyer and Seller shall diligently prosecute the
FCC Application and otherwise use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the FCC Consent as soon as possible; provided, however, except as
provided in the following sentence or in Section 1.9(d), neither Buyer nor
Seller shall be required to pay consideration to any third party to obtain FCC
Consent. Buyer and Seller shall each pay one-half of all FCC filing fees
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, irrespective of whether the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated.

  

  

(b) Buyer and Seller each shall oppose any petitions to deny or other
objections filed with respect to the FCC Application to the extent such
petition or objection relates to such party. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall
take any intentional action that would, or intentionally fail to take such
action the failure of which to take would, reasonably be expected to have the
effect of materially delaying the receipt of the FCC Consent.

  

  

(c) If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within the original
effective period of the FCC Consent, and neither party shall have terminated
this Agreement under Section 10.1, Buyer and Seller shall jointly request one
or more extensions of the effective period of the FCC Consent. No extension of
the FCC Consent shall limit the right of either party to exercise its rights
under Section 10.1.

  

  

(d) The FCC Licenses of the Stations expire on the dates corresponding thereto
as set forth in Schedule 1.1(a). If, at any point prior to Closing, an
application for the renewal of any Primary FCC License (a "Renewal
Application") must be filed pursuant to the Communications Laws (as defined
below), Seller shall timely execute, file and prosecute with the FCC such
Renewal Application in accordance with Section 4.1(b) hereof. If the FCC
Application is granted by the FCC subject to a renewal condition, then,
without limitation of Section 1.9(a), the term "FCC Consent" shall be deemed
to also include Seller's satisfaction of such renewal condition. In order to
avoid disruption or delay in the processing of the FCC Application, Buyer
agrees, as a part of the FCC Application, to request that the FCC apply its
policy permitting the assignment of FCC Licenses in transactions involving
multiple stations to proceed, notwithstanding the pendency of one or more
Renewal Applications. Buyer agrees to make such representations and
undertakings as are necessary or appropriate to invoke such policy, including
undertakings to assume, as between the parties and the FCC, the position of
the applicant before the FCC with respect to any pending Renewal Application
and to assume the corresponding regulatory risks relating to any such Renewal
Application; provided, however, that nothing set forth in this Section 1.9(d)
shall be deemed to amend or modify the provisions of Section 1.3 relating to
the Retained Obligations. In addition, and exclusive of any agreements that
Seller enters into pursuant to Section 4.1, Seller shall promptly enter into
tolling agreements with the FCC to facilitate grant of any Renewal
Application, to extend the statute of limitations for the FCC to determine or
impose a Fine against a Station in connection with (i) any pending complaints
that such Station aired programming that contained obscene, indecent or
profane material, or (ii) any other enforcement matters against a Station with
respect to which the FCC may permit Seller to enter into a tolling agreement,
and Seller will comply with such agreements. Buyer and Seller shall consult in
good faith with each other prior to Seller entering into any such tolling
agreement under this Section 1.9(d). For the purposes hereof, "Communications
Laws" shall mean the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules,
regulations and written policies of the FCC promulgated pursuant thereto).

  

  

(e) Within ten (10) business days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and
Seller shall make any required filings with the Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") pursuant to the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (including a
request for early termination of the waiting period thereunder), and shall
thereafter promptly respond to all requests received from such agencies for
additional information or documentation. The parties will cooperate in good
faith to use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions with respect
to the FTC or the DOJ, as the case may be, that would facilitate the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
contemporaneously with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
that the certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Mission Agreement"), dated as
of the date hereof, between Seller and Mission Broadcasting, Inc. ("Mission")
with respect to Television Stations KLRT-TV, Little Rock, Arkansas and
KASN(TV), Pine Bluff, Arkansas (collectively, the "Little Rock Stations")
(such transactions, collectively, being the "Little Rock Acquisition") (it
being agreed that the consummation of the Little Rock Transaction is not a
condition to the parties' obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). Expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act is referred to herein as the "HSR Clearance."
Any filing fees payable under the HSR Act relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

  

  

(f) In connection with their obligations pursuant to this Section 1.9 with
respect to pursuing the FCC Consent and the HSR Clearance, Buyer and Seller
shall (i) keep each other informed in all material respects and on a
reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by such party
from, or given by such party to, any governmental agency and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any Action by a private
party, in each case with respect to this Agreement, the Business or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) notify each other of all documents
filed with or received from any governmental agency with respect to this
Agreement, the Business or the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) furnish
each other with such information and assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with their preparation of any governmental filing
hereunder and (iv) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any filing or submission with a governmental agency in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry by or before any governmental agency relating
to this Agreement, the Business or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any Action initiated by a private party. Subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, each of Buyer and Seller shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult with the other on, all information relating to the other party or
parties, as the case may be, and their respective Affiliates, that appears in
any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party
and/or any governmental agency with respect to this Agreement, the Business or
the transactions contemplated hereby. The FCC Consent and HSR Clearance are
referred to herein collectively as the "Governmental Consents."

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (other than the
first sentence of Section 1.9(b) or as expressly provided in this Section
1.9(g)): (i) neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall have any
obligation to defend against, contest or resist any action, suit, claim,
litigation, arbitration, investigation or proceeding by a Governmental Entity
or other Person which questions the validity or legality of the transactions
contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith, or if an
injunction or other order is issued in any such action, suit, claim,
litigation, arbitration, investigation or proceeding, to seek to have lifted
or otherwise challenge such injunction or other order; and (ii) neither Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates shall be required under this Section 1.9 (and Seller
shall not agree to any of the following (without the prior written consent of
Buyer)): (A) to proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license,
transfer, dispose of, hold separate or encumber before or after the Closing
any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein of Buyer, any of its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, the Purchased Assets); (B) to consent to any sale, divestiture,
lease, license, transfer, disposition or other encumbrance by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates of any of their respective assets, licenses, operations,
rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Purchased Assets); (C) to consent to any agreement to
take any of the foregoing actions; or (D) to agree to any changes to or
restriction on, or other impairment of Buyer's ability to own or operate, any
such assets, licenses, product lines, businesses or interests therein or
Buyer's ability to transfer or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with
respect to the Purchased Assets; provided, however, and for the avoidance of
doubt, that Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to respond promptly
to any request by the FTC or the DOJ, as the case may be. As used herein,
"Governmental Entity" means any (i) federal, state, municipal or other
government, (ii) governmental or quasi-governmental entity of any nature
(including any governmental agency, branch, department, official, or entity
and any court or other tribunal) or (iii) body exercising or entitled to
exercise any administrative, executive, judicial, legislative, police,
regulatory, or taxing authority or power of any nature, including any arbitral
tribunal.

  

  

(h) Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the FCC Consent or HSR Clearance has not been obtained as of the date the
fifth (5th) Business Day after the date that the Closing would be required to
take place under Section 1.8 (assuming, for such purposes that the FCC Consent
or HSR Clearance, as applicable, has been obtained), and the principal reason
that the FCC Consent or HSR Clearance has not been obtained (as reasonably
determined by counsel for Seller and Buyer, in consultation with each other
and in the exercise of their professional judgment) relates to the pendency of
the Little Rock Transaction, then Buyer and Seller will cease to seek to
consummate the Little Rock Transaction contemporaneously with the consummation
of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, in such event, Buyer
and Seller (and, pursuant to the Option Exercise Agreement, High Plains) will
cooperate in using commercially reasonable efforts to take any actions
necessary to secure FCC Consent or HSR Clearance for the purchase by Buyer of
the Purchased Assets, including the preparation and filing of any related
amendments to the FCC Application or other similar filings with the FCC, FTC
or DOJ, as the case may be, or other governmental agency, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to take such other actions as may be necessary
to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
possible and prior to the Outside Date, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

  

  

1.10 Multi-Station Contracts

  

  

. In the event that one or more Other Seller Stations is party to, or has
rights or obligations with respect to, a Purchased Contract (a "Multi-Station
Agreement"), the rights and obligations under such Multi-Station Agreement
that are assigned to and assumed by Buyer (and included in the Purchased
Assets and Assumed Obligations, as the case may be) shall include only those
rights and obligations under such Multi-Station Agreement that are applicable
to the Stations. The rights of each Other Seller Station with respect to such
Purchased Contract and the obligations of each Other Seller Station to such
any such Purchased Contract shall not be assigned to and assumed by Buyer (and
shall be Excluded Assets and Retained Obligations, as the case may be).

a request for carriage or, to Seller's Knowledge, sought any form of relief
from carriage of a Station from the FCC and (y) neither Seller nor any High
Plains Entity has received any written notice from any MVPD with more than
5,000 subscribers in any of the Station's DMAs of such MVPD's intention to

binding obligations of Buyer and, to Buyer's Knowledge, each other party
thereto, (c) include all material terms relating to the Financing, (d) have
not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and (e) all commitment fees
required to be paid thereunder have been paid or will be paid in full when
due. Except as set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no other
conditions to the consummation of the Financing and Buyer has no reason to
believe that any condition to the Commitment Letters will not be satisfied or
waived prior to the Closing Date. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the
obligation of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not conditioned upon the closing of the Financing or Buyer's
receipt of the proceeds of the Financing or Buyer's ability to finance or pay
the Purchase Price and that any failure of Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a result of the failure of all,
or any portion of, the Financing to be funded for any reason shall constitute
a material breach by Buyer of this Agreement giving rise to Seller's right to
terminate this Agreement under Section 10.1(c) hereof, subject to the terms
and conditions of Section 10.1(c), and entitle Seller to receive the Escrow
Deposit Fund (including, if applicable, attorneys' fees and costs) pursuant to
Sections 10.5 or 11.1, subject to the terms and conditions of Section 10.5.

alternative financing, any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated
in this Agreement or the Commitment Letters, payment of all amounts required
to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and payment of all related fees and expenses, Buyer shall
be Solvent (as defined below). For purposes of this Agreement: (i) "Solvent",
when used with respect to Buyer, means that, as of any date of determination,
(A) the Present Fair Salable Value (as defined below) of its assets will, as
of such date, exceed all of its liabilities, contingent or otherwise, as of
such date, (B) Buyer will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the business in which it is engaged or will be engaged
and (C) Buyer will be able to pay its debts as they become absolute and
mature, in the ordinary course of business, taking into account the timing of
and amounts of cash to be received by it and the timing of and amounts of cash
to be payable on or in respect of its indebtedness, in each case after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the term
"Solvency" shall have a correlative meaning; (ii) "debt" means liability on a
"claim"; (iii) "claim" for purposes of this Section 3.7 means (A) any right to
payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated,
unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
secured or unsecured or (B) the right to an equitable remedy for a breach in
performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment, whether or not
such equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured; and (iv) "Present Fair Salable Value" means the amount
that may be realized if the aggregate assets of Buyer (including goodwill) are
sold as an entirety with reasonable promptness in an arm's-length transaction
under present conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises.

Seller, the High Plains entities or any such Persons liable, with respect
thereto. Buyer represents and warrants that neither of Seller, the High Plains
Entities nor any of their respective Affiliates nor any other Person has made
any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding Seller, the High Plains Entities or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not expressly set forth in

High Plains Entity relating to Seller or any High Plains Entity or other
publications or data room information provided to Buyer or its
representatives, or any other document or information in any form provided to
Buyer or its representatives in connection with the sale of the Purchased
Assets and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, nothing in this Section 3.8 will in any way limit
Buyer's rights (including under Section 7.1(a) and Article 9) with respect to
representations and warranties of Seller explicitly included in this Article
3.

  

  

3.9 Brokers

  

  

. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other third party has

reimbursement of expenses, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer.

  

  

3.10 Buyer Superseding Contracts. With respect to each Section 1.2(r)
Contract, Buyer (i) has a valid and binding contract with the applicable
counterparty to such Section 1.2(r) Contract (each a "Buyer Superseding
Contract"), and (ii) pursuant to the terms of such Buyer Superseding Contract,
the Station(s) subject to such Section 1.2(r) Contract will, upon Closing, be

cooperation with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably

cooperation shall include:

  

  

(i) preparing and furnishing to Buyer and its financing sources as promptly as
practicable with unaudited balance sheets and related statements of operations
relating to the operation of the Business for (A) each fiscal quarter ending
on or after June 30, 2012, not later than the later of the 45th day after (x)
the date hereof or (y) the end of such quarter, which financial statements

and results of operations of the Business as of and for the periods then
ended, subject to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of footnotes and
(B) all other information regarding the Business as may be necessary and
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the Financing (all such
information, the "Required Information");

  

  

(ii) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agencies and
rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda (including assistance
in the preparation of pro forma financial statements giving effect to the
transactions hereunder and to the extent Buyer has provided any relevant
information in connection therewith) and similar documents, in each case, that
are required in connection with the Financing and to the extent such
preparation requires, information regarding the Business;

  

  

(iii) reasonably cooperating with Buyer to satisfy the conditions precedent to
the Financing to the extent within the control of Seller and causing the
taking of corporate actions (subject to the occurrence of the Closing) by
Seller reasonably necessary to permit the completion of the Financing; and

  

  

(iv) obtaining such consents, approvals, authorizations and instruments which
may be reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the Financing,
including customary lien releases, and instruments of termination or
discharge.

  

  

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries and the High Plains
Entities to, use commercially reasonable efforts to update periodically the
Required Information in order to ensure that such Required Information is
Compliant.

  

  

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Marketing Period" means the
twenty business days following Seller's delivery to Buyer of the Required
Information, if that Required Information is Compliant. If Seller shall in
good faith reasonably believe that it has provided the Required Information
and such Required Information is Compliant, Seller may deliver to Buyer a
written notice to that effect (stating the date on which it believes such
Required Information that is Compliant was provided), in which case Seller
shall be deemed to have provided such Required Information unless Buyer in
good faith reasonably believes that Seller has not provided all Required
Information or that such Required Information is not Compliant and, within
five (5) business days after the delivery of such notice, delivers a written
notice to Seller to that effect, stating with reasonable specificity which
items of Required Information have not been provided or are not Compliant. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Compliant" means, with respect to the
Required Information, that such Required Information, when taken as a whole
and after giving effect to any updates from time to time, does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the Required
Information, in the light of the circumstances under which the statements
contained in the Required Information are made, not materially misleading.

  

  

(d) Whether or not the Closing occurs, Seller shall not be required to bear
any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make any
other payment in connection with the Financing. Whether or not the Closing
occurs, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, and each of its
officers, directors, members, managers, employees, agents, subsidiaries, from
and against any and all losses and Damages, suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing (including any action taken
in accordance with this Section 4.2 and any information utilized in connection
therewith), except in the case of the applicable indemnitee's gross negligence
or willful misconduct. The Seller shall not have any liability under any loan
agreement or related document or any other agreement or document relating to
the Financing unless and until the Closing occurs or in respect of the use of
any non-Compliant information provided by Seller or any High Plains Entity or
on behalf of any of them. Whether or not the Closing occurs, Buyer shall
promptly (but, in any event, by the earlier of thirty (30) days after the
incurrence thereof or on the Closing Date) reimburse Seller for all reasonable
and documented third party costs and expenses incurred by Seller in connection
with the cooperation or other actions contemplated by this Section 4.2.

  

  

(e) Buyer hereby (A) acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the
Financing is not a condition to Closing and (B) reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the
terms of this Agreement, irrespective and independently of the availability of
the Financing or any alternative financing.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any liability of Seller
to Buyer, any Financing Source or any third party pursuant to this Section 4.2
or relating in any way to the Required Information shall be subject to and
limited by Article 9 herein if the Closing occurs (or Section 10.5, in the
event of a termination of this Agreement) and any liability of Seller
hereunder shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 1)a)i)(1)
and (2) hereof if the Closing occurs (or Section 10.5, in the event of a
termination of this Agreement).

  

  

4.3 Carve-Out Financial Statements

  

  

. If requested by Buyer, Seller shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and
the High Plains Entities to, assist Buyer in preparing carve-out financial
statements for the Business for pre-Closing periods and shall provide to

information as reasonably requested in connection with a registered public
offering or other capital market transaction, including (i) access to Seller's
and the High Plains Entities' books and records pertaining to the Business
including financial and sales data for fiscal years ending December 31, 2009,

periods, and materials used to prepare the Financial Statements, (ii) access
to and cooperation from, Seller's and the High Plains Entities' independent
accountants necessary to receive customary "comfort letters" (including

December 31, 2012, and to prepare or provide a carve-out accounting review in
relation to each quarterly period during the fiscal year ended December 31,

subsequent quarterly periods, and (iii) reasonable cooperation in order to
assist Buyer in responding to SEC comments; provided, however, that, subject

set forth in this Section 4.3 shall survive the Closing until they are fully
performed.

JOINT COVENANTS

  

  

Buyer and Seller hereby covenant and agree as follows:

  

  

5.1 Confidentiality

their stations. To the extent not already a direct party thereto, Buyer hereby
assumes the NDA and agrees to be bound by the provisions thereof applicable to
its Affiliate which is a party thereto and such NDA shall remain in effect in

(b) If after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time any Purchased
Asset is lost, damaged or destroyed or otherwise not in the condition
described in Section 2.6, then:

such Purchased Asset, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
nature of such loss, damage or destruction, the cause thereof (if known or
reasonably ascertainable) and the insurance coverage, if any, available with
respect to such lost, damaged or destroyed Purchased Asset; provided, however,
that, without limiting Seller's obligations pursuant to Section 5.4(a),
5.4(b)(ii) and 5.4(b)(iii), which shall apply irrespective of the value of the
lost, damaged or destroyed Purchased Asset, Seller shall not be required to
deliver the notice contemplated by this Section 5.4(b)(i) if the value of the
lost, damaged or destroyed Purchased Asset is less than $25,000;

  

  

(ii) Seller shall, and shall cause each of its subsidiaries and the High
Plains Entities to, use commercially reasonable efforts to repair or replace
such Purchased Asset, including by submitting one or more claims under any
applicable insurance policy maintained by Seller or any High Plains Entity
with respect to such lost, damaged or destroyed Purchased Asset and applying
the full amount of proceeds received by Seller or any High Plains Entity to
the repair or replacement of such lost, damaged or destroyed Purchased Asset;
provided, however, that, neither Seller nor any High Plains Entity shall be
obligated to repair or replace any lost, damaged or destroyed Purchased Asset
if (A) such Purchased Asset was obsolete or unnecessary for the continued
operation of the Business in the ordinary course of business and in accordance
with the FCC Licenses; provided, however, that, Seller shall provide Buyer
with written notice of the foregoing within five (5) days of such Purchased
Asset being lost, damaged or destroyed or (B) the value of the lost, damaged
or destroyed Purchased Asset is less than $25,000; and

  

  

(iii) if such repair or replacement is not completed prior to Closing, then,
subject to Section 10.1(d), the parties shall proceed to Closing (with
Seller's representations and warranties deemed modified to take into account
any such condition) and Seller shall or shall cause a High Plains Entity
promptly so repair or replace such Purchased Asset after Closing (and Buyer
will provide Seller access and any other reasonable assistance requested by
Seller with respect to such obligation), except that if such damage or
destruction materially disrupts the operations of any Station, then Buyer may
postpone Closing until the date five (5) business days after operations are
restored in all material respects, subject to Section 10.1; provided,
notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, any amounts paid by or
on behalf of Seller pursuant to, or in connection with, this Section 5.4,
shall not reduce the Cap with respect to Seller's obligation to indemnify any
Buyer Group Member pursuant to, and subject to, the terms and conditions of
Article 9.

  

  

5.5 Consents

estoppel certificates reasonably acceptable to Buyer from lessors under any
Real Property Leases requiring consent to assignment (if any), but no such
third party consents or estoppel certificates are conditions to Closing except

cooperate, and shall cause any relevant High Plains Entity to cooperate, to
the extent feasible in effecting a lawful and commercially reasonable
arrangement under which Buyer shall receive the benefits under the Purchased
Contract from and after Closing, and to the extent of the benefits received,
Buyer shall pay and perform Seller's obligations arising under the Purchased
Contract from and after Closing in accordance with its terms and indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates for any costs, expenses or liabilities
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by them in connection
with the enforcement of such Purchased Contract as it relates to any period

applicable law. Employees whose employment with Seller terminates and who
accept or are treated by Buyer as accepting such offers of employment by and
actually commence employment with Buyer (or its Affiliates) in accordance with
this Section 5.6 are referred to collectively herein as the "Transferred
Employees." For a period of one (1) year following the Closing (provided the
applicable Transferred Employee is still employed by Buyer), Buyer shall
provide each Transferred Employee (i) substantially similar (or greater)
salary, hourly wage rate, overtime and premium pay and substantially similar
(or greater) target bonus, commission and incentive pay opportunity as
applicable to similarly situated employees of Buyer having the same or similar
job functions and responsibilities and seniority as such Transferred Employee
and (ii) employee benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to
those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer. At the Closing, Buyer
shall provide Seller with a list of the Transferred Employees. Buyer shall
provide Seller a copy of its form of employment offer prior to distribution to
Employees. Unless otherwise provided under the terms of an employment
agreement identified on Schedule 1.1(d), each Transferred Employee shall be
employed by Buyer on an at will basis and nothing shall prohibit Buyer from
terminating the employment of any such Transferred Employees at any time after
the Closing Date or changing any of the terms and conditions of employment
related to such Transferred Employees at any time, except for such changes
that are inconsistent with Buyer's obligations as set forth in this Section
5.6.

  

  

(c) In the case of each Transferred Employee under a written employment
agreement identified on Schedule 1.1(d) as of the date hereof or entered into
prior to the Closing in accordance with the terms hereof, including Section
4.1, Buyer shall assume Seller's obligations under such Purchased Contract at
the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer shall not assume any written employment agreement identified
on Schedule 1.1(d) (or entered into prior to the Closing) of, nor owe any
obligation to, any Employee who is not a Transferred Employee.

  

  

(d) If any Employee to whom Buyer has offered employment does not consent to
employment with Buyer or for any other reason (other than rescission of such
offer by Buyer) does not commence employment with Buyer and severance benefits
are owed to such employee as a result, such severance benefits will be paid by
Seller or the High Plains Entities (as applicable).

  

  

(e) Buyer shall permit Transferred Employees (and their spouses and
dependents) to participate in its "employee welfare benefit plans" (including
without limitation health insurance plans) and "employee pension benefit
plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) and 3(2) of ERISA, respectively) in which
similarly situated employees of Buyer are generally eligible to participate,
with coverage effective immediately upon the Closing (and without exclusion
from coverage on account of any pre-existing condition except to the extent
such persons were subject to such pre-existing condition limitations under
Seller's group health plan), with service with Seller (and any predecessors of
Seller) deemed service with Buyer for purposes of eligibility, waiting
periods, vesting periods (but not benefit accrual) based on length of service
and calculation of vacation and severance benefits, if applicable.

  

  

(f) Effective as of the Closing Date or the payroll period ending immediately
after the Closing Date, Seller shall have contributed to Seller's 401(k) Plan
all matching or other employer contributions, if any, with respect to the
Transferred Employees' employment service rendered prior to the Effective Time
(irrespective of any end-of-year service requirements otherwise applicable to
such contributions) and cause the matching and other employer contribution
amounts of all Transferred Employees under the Seller 401(k) Plan to become
fully vested as of the Closing Date. Following the Closing Date, Seller shall
take all actions necessary or appropriate to ensure that under the terms of
the Seller 401(k) Plan, each Transferred Employee with an account balance is
eligible to receive a distribution as a result of the Closing. From and after
the Closing, Buyer shall permit each Transferred Employee who participates in
Seller's 401(k) plan to elect to make direct rollovers of their account
balances (including any outstanding loan balances) into Buyer's 401(k) plan as
of the Closing (or as soon as practicable thereafter when Buyer's 401(k) plan
is capable of accepting such rollovers), subject to compliance with applicable
law and subject to the reasonable requirements of Buyer's 401(k) plan.

  

  

(g) To the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements and, with respect
to sick leave, not to exceed the maximum amount of sick leave afforded to
similarly situated employees of Buyer (after giving credit for past service
with Seller and its predecessors and Affiliates), each Transferred Employee
will be credited under Buyer's vacation and sick leave policy with (i) the
full amount of vacation leave accrued by such Transferred Employee but unused
as of the Closing Date under the vacation policy of Seller applicable to such
Transferred Employee and (ii) the lesser of forty (40) hours or the full
amount of sick leave accrued by such Transferred Employee but unused as of the
Closing Date under the sick leave policy of Seller applicable to such
Transferred Employee. To the extent that any unused vacation is not credited
to any Transferred Employee under this Section 5.6(g), Seller and the High
Plains Entities will pay to each such Transferred Employee the cash value of
such unused vacation as of the first payroll date ending after the Closing
Date or such other time as required by applicable Legal Requirements.

  

  

(h) All workers' compensation obligations relating to, arising out of or
resulting from any claim by any Employee that results from an injury that
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time shall be retained by Seller and the
High Plains Entities. All workers' compensation obligations relating to,
arising out of or resulting from any claim by a Transferred Employee that
results from an injury that occurs after the Effective Time shall be the
exclusive responsibility of the Buyer. Seller further agrees that (A) any
Employee, including any Transferred Employee, who has received an offer of
employment from Buyer but has not yet commenced employment with Buyer and who
as of the Closing Date is receiving or is entitled to receive short-term or
long-term disability benefits under Seller's short-term or long-term
disability benefit plans shall receive or continue to be paid such benefits
after the Closing in accordance with the terms of the disability plans of
Seller and the High Plains Entities and (B) Buyer shall have no obligation to
provide any disability or other benefits or compensation to any such Person.

  

  

(i) Buyer or its Affiliates will have responsibility for complying with the
continuation coverage requirements under Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA")
solely for the "MandA qualified beneficiaries" (as defined in QandA-4 of Treasury
Regulation Section 54.4980B-9) who are listed on Schedule 5.6(i), as disclosed
as of the Effective Time. Schedule 5.6(i) will sets forth a list of (i) each
individual who is receiving or entitled to receive COBRA coverage from Seller
as of the Effective Time (or potentially entitled to receive COBRA coverage
from Seller at a later time in the case of each Employee on short-term or
long-term disability) and who immediately prior to the Effective Time is an
employee principally of the Business or was last employed principally in the
Business (or is an eligible beneficiary of any of the foregoing), but not any
other individual, (ii) the effective date of such coverage for each such
individual, (iii) the amount of the monthly COBRA cost with respect to such
individual and (iv) the expected duration of such coverage. Except as provided
in this Section 5.6(i), Buyer shall have no responsibility at any time arising
under or in connection with COBRA with respect to any individual who is a
former employee of Seller as of immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

(j) The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this
Section 5.6 or any other provision of this Agreement, shall (i) be construed
to establish, amend, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, contract, policy or arrangement of Seller, the High Plains Entities
or Buyer, (ii) limit the ability of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to amend,
modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them, (iii) create any third-party beneficiary rights or
obligations in any Person (including any Employee, Transferred Employee, or
Labor Union) other than the parties to this Agreement or create a contract
between Buyer, Seller, any High Plains Entity or any of their respective
Affiliates on the one hand and any employee of Seller or any High Plains
Entity on the other hand, and no employee of Seller may rely on this Agreement
as the basis for any breach of contract claim against Buyer or Seller, (iv) be
deemed or construed to require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue to
employ any particular employee of Seller or any High Plains Entity for any
period after the Closing, or (v) be deemed or construed to limit Buyer's or
any of its Affiliates' right to terminate the employment of any Transferred
Employee during any period after the Closing Date or confer on any Person any
right to employment or continued employment or to a particular term or
condition of employment with Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

(k) Schedule 5.6(a) separately identifies each Employee who is represented by
a Labor Union (and specifies which such Labor Union) as of the date hereof and
will be updated by Seller no more than fifteen (15) business days and at least
ten (10) business days prior to the Closing pursuant to Section 5.6(a). Buyer
shall adopt each Collective Bargaining Agreement listed on Schedule 1.1(d) and
assume all obligations with respect to any Transferred Employee under such
Collective Bargaining Agreement that arise out of, or are attributable to, the
period after the Effective Time. To the extent required by applicable law,
Buyer shall recognize each Labor Union as the exclusive representative of the
specific group of Transferred Employees that such Labor Union represents
pursuant to any assumed Collective Bargaining Agreement to which it is a
party.

  

  

5.7 Accounting Services; Access to and Retention of Records

  

  

.

  

  

(a) During the first sixty (60) days after the Closing, Buyer shall provide to
Seller at no additional cost the reasonable services of the Business' business
offices, together with reasonable access to related systems and records, for
the purposes of closing the books of the Business for the period prior to the
Closing, all substantially in accordance with the procedures and practices
applied by Buyer's business offices, as amended from time to time.

  

  

(b) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall preserve, in accordance with
Buyer's normal document retention procedures and practices, all books and
records transferred by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and shall
provide Seller a reasonable opportunity to access and obtain copies, at
Seller's expense, of any such books and records. In addition to the foregoing,
from and after the Closing, Buyer shall afford to Seller, and its counsel,
accountants, and other authorized agents and representatives, at Seller's
expense, during normal business hours, reasonable access to the employees,
books, records and other data relating to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Obligations, or the Transferred Employees in its possession with respect to
the periods prior to the Closing, and the right to make copies and extracts
therefrom, to the extent that such access may be reasonably required by Seller
(a) to facilitate the investigation, litigation and final disposition of any
claims which may have been or may be made against Seller, (b) for the
preparation of Tax Returns and audits and (c) for any other reasonable and
proper business purpose, provided in each case that such access does not
unreasonably disrupt the business and operations of the Business or of Buyer.

  

  

5.8 Further Action

  

  

. In furtherance (and not in limitation) of the provisions set forth in this
Agreement, at all times prior to the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all
action necessary or desirable in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as is practicable.

  

  

5.9 Notice

  

  

. Each party will give prompt written notice to the other party of any fact or
condition that causes or constitutes a breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants in this Agreement, or of any action, suit, proceeding
or investigation that is instituted or threatened against such party to
restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality or propriety of any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
pending the Closing, Seller shall give Buyer prompt written notice of the
occurrence of any of the following:

  

  

(a) Any loss, damage or destruction, as required pursuant to Section 5.4;

  

  

(b) the commencement of any proceeding before the FCC or any other
Governmental Entity involving any of the FCC Licenses or which could have a
Material Adverse Effect, other than proceedings or litigation of general
applicability to the television broadcasting industry that do not have a
disproportionate impact on the Business or the Stations as compared with other
broadcast television stations generally;

  

  

(c) any material labor grievance, material controversy, strike or material
dispute affecting the Business or the Stations and the scheduling of any
bargaining discussions with the certified bargaining unit;

  

  

(d) any violation by Seller, any High Plains Entity or any Station of any
Legal Requirement which would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect;

  

  

(e) any notice received by Seller of any High Plains Entity of any material
breach, material default, claimed material breach or material default or
termination of any Contract that, if it were in effect on the Closing Date,
would be a Purchased Contract;

  

  

(f) any material correspondence received by Seller or any High Plains Entity
from or sent by Seller or any High Plains Entity to any MVPD concerning must
carry status, retransmission consent and other matters arising under the
Communications Laws, including any material correspondence related to the
status of negotiations with any MVPD; and

  

  

(g) the loss of carriage or change in channel position of any Station on any
MVPD or the cessation of broadcasting or failure of a Station to broadcast at
least 80% of its authorized power for more than twenty-four (24) consecutive
hours or any other development which has a Material Adverse Effect on the
operation of the Business or the Stations.

  

  

5.10 Title Insurance; Survey

  

  

. Buyer may obtain, at its sole option and expense, and Seller shall and shall
cause each High Plains Entity (as applicable) to grant Buyer access to obtain
(a) commitments for owner's and lender's title insurance policies on the Owned
Real Property and commitments for lessee's and lender's title insurance
policies for all Leased Real Property (collectively the "Title Commitments"),
and (b) an ALTA survey on each parcel of Real Property (the "Surveys");
provided, however, that Seller and each High Plains Entity (as applicable)
shall provide Buyer with any existing Title Commitments and Surveys in its
possession. The Title Commitments will evidence a commitment to issue an ALTA
title insurance policy insuring good, marketable and indefeasible fee simple
(or leasehold, if applicable) title to each parcel of the Real Property
contemplated above for such amount as Buyer directs and will contain no
exceptions except for Assumed Liabilities or Permitted Liens. Seller and each
High Plains Entity (as applicable) shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in
obtaining such Title Commitments and Surveys (including by providing customary
representations and affidavits to Buyer's title company), provided that
neither Seller nor any High Plains Entity shall be required to incur any cost,
expense or other liability in connection therewith. If the Title Commitments
or Surveys reveal any Lien on the title, other than Assumed Liabilities or
Permitted Liens, Buyer may notify Seller in writing of such objectionable
matter as soon as Buyer determines that such matter is not an Assumed
Liability or Permitted Lien, and Seller shall and shall cause each High Plains
Entity to use commercially reasonable efforts to remove such objectionable
matter as required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

5.11 Environmental Assessments; Phase I Investigations

  

  

. Within sixty (60) days from the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall have the
right, at its sole cost and expense, to engage an environmental consulting
firm to conduct a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment and Compliance Review,
as such terms are commonly understood (a "Phase I Environment Assessment"),
with respect to the Real Property, provided such Phase I Environment
Assessment shall be conducted only (i) during regular business hours, (ii)
with no less than two (2) business days prior written notice to Seller, (iii)
in a manner which will not unduly interfere with the operation of the Business
or the use of access to or egress from the Real Property and (iv) without any
material damage to any property, real or personal, of Seller.

  

  

5.12 Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable

  

  

.

  

  

(a) On or as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later
than ten (10) business days after the end of the calendar month in which the
Closing occurs, Seller will deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth the
outstanding accounts receivable of the Business as of the Effective Time (the
"Accounts Receivable") and the outstanding accounts payable, including unpaid
commissions and bonuses due to Employees of the Business as of the Effective
Time (the "Accounts Payable").

  

  

(b) Subject to the terms and provisions in this Section 5.12, Buyer will
collect the Accounts Receivable in the same manner and with the same diligence
that Buyer uses to collect its own accounts receivable including account
reconciliation procedures for a period of 180 calendar days following the
Closing Date (the "Collection Period"). Buyer will not be obligated to, and
without the prior written consent of Seller will not, institute litigation,
employ any collection agency, legal counsel, or other third party, or take any
other extraordinary means of collections or pay any expenses to third parties
to collect the Accounts Receivable. All amounts collected by Buyer after the
Closing from an account debtor will be applied first to the Accounts
Receivable of such account debtor in the order of their origination, unless
the account debtor disputes such Accounts Receivable in writing or designates
payment of a different Accounts Receivable in writing. If during the
Collection Period a dispute arises with regard to an account included among
the Accounts Receivable, Buyer shall promptly advise Seller thereof and may
(or, if requested by Seller, shall) return that account to Seller. Buyer shall
not issue any credit or accommodation against any Accounts Receivable without
the prior written consent of Seller.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall pay, within forty (40) calendar days after the end of the
month of receipt of such Accounts Receivable, related commissions or bonuses
due to Employees or national sales representatives (unless already paid by
Seller or the High Plains Entities) (the "Net Receivables") as applicable (any
payment to national sales representatives shall be reconciled to actual
collections). Such Net Receivables shall be paid in consultation with Seller
and consistent with its current business practices subject to holdbacks and
offsets as reasonably directed by Seller and consistent with its current
business practices.

  

  

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.12, during the Collection
Period, Buyer will use the Net Receivables collected to pay the Accounts
Payable in a timely manner, provided, however, Buyer has no obligation to use
its own funds in excess of the Net Receivables to pay Accounts Payable. Within
thirty (30) calendar days after the end of each month during the Collection
Period, Buyer will deliver to Seller a written report, prepared in good faith
and accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation, with respect to (i)
the collections made with respect to the Accounts Receivable, (ii) the
calculation of Net Receivables and (iii) payments remitted with respect to the
Accounts Payable together with a copy of the invoices therefor. Such report
shall be accompanied by a payment to Seller of the amount by which the
collected Net Receivables paid during such month exceed the amount of the
Accounts Payable during such month. The parties shall cooperate in good faith
to answer any questions and resolve any issues raised by Seller in connection
with its review of such report.

  

  

(e) Within forty (40) calendar days after the end of the Collection Period,
Buyer shall deliver to Seller a final written report ("Final Report") which
report shall be accompanied by a final payment to Seller of the amount by
which the Net Receivables collected during the Collection Period exceeded the
amount paid in respect of the Accounts Payable during the Collection Period
less any interim amounts theretofore remitted to Seller. The Final Report
shall be prepared in good faith, accompanied by reasonable supporting
documentation and contain (i) a statement of accounts for each account
prepared in a manner consistent with Buyer's own record-keeping practices,
(ii) copies of all invoices received by Buyer after the Closing Date for
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and not previously provided to
Seller pursuant to Section 5.12(b), and (iii) an Accounts Receivable aging
report for the Business. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver the Final Report to Seller in an electronic format. The parties shall
cooperate in good faith to answer any questions and resolve any issues raised
by Seller in connection with its review of the Final Report.

  

  

(f) Following the expiration of the Collection Period, Buyer shall have no
further obligations pursuant to this Section 5.12, except to remit to Seller
any amounts received by Buyer which can be specifically identified as a
payment on account of any Accounts Receivable will be promptly paid over or
forwarded to Seller.

  

  

(g) All amounts due to Seller or Buyer under this Section 5.12 that are not
paid in accordance with the provisions hereof shall bear interest until paid
at a rate per annum equal to the generally prevailing prime interest rate (as
reported by The Wall Street Journal). The parties acknowledge and agree that
Accounts Receivable collected by Buyer for Seller pursuant to this Section
5.12 shall not be subject to a right of offset for any claim by Buyer against
Seller.

  

  

(h) After the Closing, Seller, at its own expense, shall have the right to
access and/or audit the books, records and operating practices and procedures
of the Business, upon reasonable notice to Buyer and during the normal
business hours of the Business, to confirm compliance by Buyer with the
provisions of this Section 5.12.

  

  

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.12, the parties
acknowledge and agree that Buyer shall not assume, or in any way become liable
for, any liabilities or obligations of Seller of any kind or nature with
respect to the Accounts Payable. Buyer shall have no obligation to make
payment respecting any Accounts Payable, if at such time, Accounts Payable
exceed the amount of collected Net Receivables. If at any time or from time to
time during the Collection Period the amount owing in respect of any Accounts
Payable exceeds the amount of available collected Net Receivables, Buyer will
promptly notify Seller of such deficit and Seller shall thereafter pay to
Buyer such difference within thirty (30) calendar days after the delivery to
Seller of such notice. If Seller shall not pay the deficit to Buyer within the
time period specified, Buyer shall have the option in its sole discretion to
pay such deficit, and Seller shall thereafter reimburse Buyer immediately for
such amount, including interest at the rate set forth in Section 5.12(h)
above.

  

  

(j) Effective upon the Closing Date and solely for purposes of facilitating
Buyer's compliance with this Section 5.12, Seller hereby irrevocably
constitutes and appoints Buyer, its successors and assigns, the true and
lawful attorney of Seller with full power of substitution, in the name of
Buyer, or the name of Seller, on behalf of and for the benefit of Seller, to
collect the Accounts Receivables, to endorse, without recourse, checks, notes
and other instruments in the name of Seller, to pay the Accounts Payables and
to do all such further acts and things in relation thereto as is contemplated
by Section 5.12 hereof. Seller agrees that the foregoing powers are coupled
with an interest and shall be irrevocable by Seller except as provided herein.
Each Seller further authorizes Buyer and its officers, successors and assigns
to receive and open all mail, telegrams, packages, electronic mail and other
communications that are addressed to such Seller and that relate to the
Business and/or any Purchased Asset, and to reply to and retain such
communications. The preceding sentence constitutes full authorization to the
postal authorities, express courier companies and other persons to make
delivery of such communications directly to Buyer or to persons specified by
Buyer. Seller confers this authority upon Buyer and its officers, successors
and assigns on the condition that Buyer shall promptly forward to Seller all
such mail, telegrams, electronic mail and other communications that do not
relate solely to the Business or the Purchased Assets.

  

  

5.13 Cooperation

  

  

. Buyer shall exercise reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller to release
any Liens on the Purchased Assets. Buyer acknowledges that Seller may make use
of the proceeds from the Purchase Price for the repayment of indebtedness
associated with any Liens on the Purchased Assets.

  

  

5.14 Tax Returns and Payments

  

  

.

  

  

(a) All material Tax Returns, estimates, and reports with respect to the
Purchased Assets or operation of the Business that are required to be filed by
Seller prior to the Closing Date or relating to periods prior to the Closing
Date will be timely filed when due with the appropriate taxing authorities or
extension requests will have been timely filed and granted. All material Taxes
pertaining to Seller's ownership of the Purchased Assets or Seller's operation
of the Business prior to the Closing Date will be paid by Seller when due and
payable unless protested in good faith.

  

  

(b) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes
and fees (including any penalties and interest), incurred in connection with
the transactions consummated pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the
Assets conveyed by Seller will be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by
Seller. Any Tax Returns that are required to be filed in connection with
transfer Taxes will be prepared by Buyer, at its own expense (except where
Seller is legally required to file any such Tax Return, in which case Seller
will prepare and file such Tax Return at its own expense). Without limiting
the foregoing, Buyer and Seller will cooperate in all reasonable respects to
prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns.

  

  

5.15 Fulfillment of Conditions

  

  

. Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy each of the
conditions for Closing of Buyer set forth in Article 7, and Buyer will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy each of the conditions for Closing
of Seller set forth in Article 6.

  

  

5.16 Further Action Regarding Intangible Property

  

  

. If, after the Closing Date, either Buyer or Seller identifies any Intangible
Property that is then owned by Seller or any High Plains Entity, Seller shall,
or shall cause such High Plains Entity to, transfer all rights in and to and,
if applicable, deliver, such Intangible Property to Buyer or its designated
Affiliate for no additional consideration. If, after the Closing Date, either
Buyer or Seller identifies any Intellectual Property that was transferred to
it from Seller but that does not constitute Intangible Property, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the applicable Affiliate to, promptly transfer all rights in
and to and, if applicable, deliver, such Intellectual Property to Seller for
no additional consideration. Each party shall take such further actions, and
execute and deliver such further documents, instruments and agreements, as the
other party may reasonably request, whether on or after the Closing Date, to
implement and/or give effect to the provisions of this Section 5.16.

  

  

5.17 Sublicense under NexGen Source Code

  

  

.

  

  

(a) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Source Code" means all of Seller's rights (including all of Seller's
Intellectual Property rights (if any)) in and to the NexGen TV source code in
the form delivered by Seller to Buyer on or before the Closing Date.

  

  

(ii) "Section 5.19 of the CC APA" means Section 5.19 of the Asset Purchase
Agreement, made as of April 20, 2007, by and among the company or companies
set forth as Seller on the signature page thereto, Clear Channel Broadcasting,
Inc., and TV Acquisition LLC, of which Buyer has been provided a true and
correct copy of Section 5.19 thereof.

  

  

(b) Effective upon the Closing Date:

  

  

(i) Buyer covenants and agrees that it shall use the Source Code in connection
with Buyer's ownership and operation of the Stations and, to the extent
permitted by Section 5.19 of the CC APA, other television stations owned or
controlled by Buyer. Except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.17,
neither Buyer nor its Affiliates shall sell, assign, license, or grant any of
its rights with respect to the Source Code to any other Person, or otherwise
permit any other Person to possess or use the Source Code in any manner, other
than to a Person that, directly or indirectly, acquires one of more of the
Stations from Buyer or its Affiliates, in which case, Buyer shall ensure that
such Person agrees to be bound to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 5.17. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Clear Channel Communications,
Inc. and its Affiliates are using and may continue to use, and that Seller is
not sublicensing to Buyer or its Affiliates, certain software, firmware and
hardware that may have previously been used in connection with or bundled with
the Source Code or into which the Source Code may have been previously
integrated, and Buyer covenants and agrees that it will not (and shall require
any Person that acquires, directly or indirectly, one of more of the Stations
from Buyer or its Affiliates not to) make any claim or initiate or maintain
any suit or other proceeding against Clear Channel Communications, Inc. and
its Affiliates in respect of such retained software, firmware and hardware or
the use, sale, assignment, license or other disposition thereof.

  

  

(ii) Seller hereby grants to Buyer and its Affiliates a non-exclusive,
perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-sublicensable, non-transferable
(except as set forth in this Section 5.17(b)(ii)), worldwide license to use,
reproduce, distribute, display, perform, improve, modify, update, upgrade,
enhance, make derivative works based upon and otherwise exploit the Source
Code, but in each case, in connection with the ownership and operation of the
Stations and, to the extent permitted by Section 5.19 of the CC APA, other
television stations owned or controlled by Buyer. Neither Buyer nor any
Affiliate shall sell, assign, license, or grant any of its rights with respect
to the Source Code to any other Person, or otherwise permit any other Person
to possess or use the Source Code in any manner, except that the sublicense
granted pursuant to this Section 5.17(b)(ii) may be assigned by Buyer to any
Person that acquires, directly or indirectly, one of more of the Stations from
Buyer or its Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted to
Buyer and its Affiliates hereunder with respect to the Source Code include the
right to use and otherwise exploit the object code version of NexGen TV.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.17, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that none of the rights and sublicenses granted to
Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.17 shall be construed, interpreted or
otherwise deemed to amend, contravene or otherwise exceed the scope of the
rights granted to Seller with respect to the Source Code pursuant to Section
5.19 of the CC APA.

  

  

5.18 Financing

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Buyer shall not agree to any amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification of, or waive any of its rights under, any Commitment Letter or
any definitive agreements related to any Financing, in each case, without the
prior written consent of the Seller; provided that the Buyer may amend,
replace, supplement or otherwise modify or waive its rights under any
Commitment Letter or definitive agreement related to any Financing (including
any replacement thereof in whole or in part with a high yield and/or high
yield bridge financing) without the prior written consent of Seller so long as
any such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or waiver (i) does
not reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing below an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and pay related fees and
expenses, (ii) does not impose new or additional conditions to the Financing
that would be reasonably expected to delay or prevent the funding of the
Financing, and (iii) does not adversely impact the ability of Buyer to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable (in
each case, taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) to
consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in
the Commitment Letters (as such terms may be modified or adjusted in
accordance with the terms hereof or of, and within the limits of, the "flex"
provisions contained in any related fee letter), including (i) using
reasonable efforts to (w) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, (x) negotiate

reasonable efforts to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters
(provided that all conditions to Buyer's obligations under this Agreement

and the Marketing Period has ended). Buyer shall furnish correct and complete
copies of all such definitive agreements to Seller promptly upon their
execution. At Seller's request, Buyer shall inform Seller in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to obtain and consummate the Financing (including
by providing substantially final draft agreements to the extent reasonably
requested). Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement, modification or
waiver of any Commitment Letter in accordance with this Section 5.18(a), (A)

modified or adjusted in accordance with the terms hereof and of, and within

any reason and such portion is reasonably required to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and pay related fees and expenses, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as reasonably
practicable but in any event no later than the Outside Date, financing from
alternative sources for such portion and which financing shall, in any event,
(i) be in an aggregate amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and pay related fees and expenses, and (ii) not adversely
impact the ability of Buyer to timely consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In the event that alternative Financing is arranged in
accordance with this Section 5.18(b), the term "Commitment Letter" shall mean
the commitment letters for such alternative Financing (as amended, replaced,
supplemented, modified or waived in accordance with Section 5.18(a)). In the
event that alternative Financing shall be obtained pursuant to this Section
5.18(b), the parties shall comply with the covenants in Section 5.18(a) with
respect to such alternative Financing mutatis mutandis. If applicable, Buyer
shall furnish correct and complete copies of all definitive agreements
relating to the alternative Financing to Seller promptly upon their execution.
At Seller's request, Buyer shall inform Seller in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to obtain and consummate the alternative Financing.

party of any demand, suit, claim or assertion of liability by third parties
that is subject to indemnification hereunder (a "Claim"), but a failure to
give such notice or delaying such notice shall not affect the indemnified
party's rights or the indemnifying party's obligations except to the extent
the indemnifying party's ability to remedy, contest, defend or settle with
respect to such Claim is thereby materially prejudiced and provided that,
where applicable, such notice is given within the time period described in
Section 9.1.

  

  

(b) The indemnifying party shall have the right to undertake the defense or
opposition to such Claim with counsel selected by it. In the event that the
indemnifying party does not undertake such defense or opposition, the
indemnified party may undertake the defense, opposition, compromise or
settlement of such Claim with counsel selected by it at the indemnifying
party's cost, except that the indemnified party shall not, without the
indemnifying party's written consent, settle or compromise any Claim or
consent to entry of any judgment which settlement, compromise or judgment does
not include the giving by the claimant to the indemnifying party of a release
from all liability to the claimant in respect of such Claim, if the
indemnifying party is party to such Claim.

  

  

(c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding:

  

  

(i) the indemnified party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense,
to participate in the defense, opposition, compromise or settlement of the
Claim;

  

  

(ii) the indemnifying party shall not, without the indemnified party's written
consent, settle or compromise any Claim or consent to entry of any judgment
which (A) settlement, compromise or judgment does not include the giving by
the claimant to the indemnified party of a release from all liability in
respect of such Claim, and (B) contains any covenants or undertakings binding
on the indemnified party other than customary agreements to keep the terms of
such settlement or compromise confidential; and

  

  

(iii) in the event that the indemnifying party undertakes the defense of or
opposition to any Claim, the indemnified party, by counsel or other
representative of its own choosing and at its sole cost and expense, shall
have the right to consult with the indemnifying party and its counsel
concerning such Claim and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and
their respective counsel shall cooperate in good faith with respect to such
Claim.

  

  

9.4 No Special Damages, Mitigation

  

  

. No indemnifying party shall be liable to any indemnified party for special,
indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, or lost profits,
unless and to the extent such damages are payable to a third party. Each party
agrees to exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Damages
in respect of any pending or threatened Claim.

  

  

9.5 Offset

  

  

. The amount of any Damages indemnifiable by any indemnifying party to any
indemnified party pursuant to this Article 9 will be reduced to reflect (a)
the value of any net Tax benefit (whether monetary or otherwise) that will be

Damages and (b) any amount actually recovered or recoverable by the
indemnified party under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such
Damages.

  

  

9.6 Treatment of Indemnity Benefits

  

  

. All payments made by Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, to or for the
benefit of the other pursuant to any indemnification obligations under this
Agreement shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes and such agreed treatment shall govern for purposes of this
Agreement.

  

  

9.7 Environmental Liabilities

  

  

. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (and subject in all respects
to the Cap), with respect to any claim for indemnification regarding any
breach of any representation or warranty under Section 2.9, Seller shall have
no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless a Buyer Indemnified Party for (a)
any Damages that would not have arisen but for any intrusive investigation
(including any soil, groundwater or surface water sampling) by Buyer or any of
its agents or representatives, except to the extent such intrusive
investigation was consented to by Seller, was required by or required to
attain compliance with Environmental Laws or environmental permits or a
Governmental Entity, was necessary to address a significant risk to human
health or safety, or was affirmatively required in writing by a landlord or by
a lease agreement, or (b) any investigation, monitoring or remedial costs or
other related costs that exceed the cost to meet a reasonably cost-effective
standard or remedy required by applicable Environmental Laws that is
consistent with the commercial or industrial use of the site as of the Closing
Date, as applicable (including any site-specific standards based on risk
assessments and any remedies or standards that require or are limited to the
imposition of deed restrictions, land use restrictions or monitored natural
attenuation), that do not materially interfere with the use of or materially
impair the value of the property and provided that such remedy is acceptable
to (i) the Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over the condition if the
approval of such Governmental Entity is required therefor under applicable
Environmental Laws and (ii) any landlord (with respect to conditions on leased
real property) if the approval of such landlord is required therefor,
including the applicable lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may clean
up to more stringent standards, but the increased cost shall be borne by Buyer
and not subject to indemnification by Seller.

  

  

9.8 Exclusive Remedies

  

  

. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that, if the Closing occurs, the
indemnification provisions of this Article 9 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedies of Buyer and Seller for any breach of the representations or
warranties or nonperformance of or default under any covenants or agreements
of Buyer or Seller contained in this Agreement or any Buyer Ancillary
Agreements or Seller Ancillary Agreements, and neither party shall have any
liability to the other party under any circumstances for special, indirect,
consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, or lost profits, unless and to
the extent such damages are payable to a third party; provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve or limit (a) the liability
of any party from any liability or Damages arising out of or resulting from
such party's fraud with scienter in connection with the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement, the Seller Ancillary Agreements or the Buyer
Ancillary Agreements, (b) Seller's obligations under Section 5.4(b)(iii). In
furtherance of the foregoing, each of Buyer and Seller hereby waive, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, except in the case of fraud
with scienter, any and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have
against the other arising under or based upon any federal, state or local law,
rule or regulation (including any such rights, claims or causes of action
arising under or based upon common law, tort or otherwise and relating to this
Agreement, any Seller Ancillary Document or any Buyer Ancillary Document
(including any certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.1(c) or Section
7.1(c)) or the transactions contemplated hereby) other than any rights, claims
or actions arising under Section 5.4(b)(iii) and this Article 9.

compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

TERMINATION AND REMEDIES

  

  

10.1 Termination

  

  

. Subject to Section 10.3, this Agreement may be terminated prior to Closing
as follows:

  

  

(a) by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller;

  

  

(b) by written notice of Buyer to Seller if (i) Buyer is not in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement, (ii) Seller breaches its
representations or warranties, or defaults in the performance of its
covenants, contained in this Agreement and (iii) all such Seller breaches and
defaults that are not cured within the Cure Period (as defined in Section
10.2) would prevent the conditions to the obligations of Buyer set forth in
Section 7.1 from being satisfied;

  

  

(c) by written notice of Seller to Buyer if (i) Seller is not in material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement, (ii) Buyer breaches its
representations or warranties, or defaults in the performance of its
covenants, contained in this Agreement and (iii) all such Buyer breaches and
defaults that are not cured within the Cure Period would prevent the
conditions to the obligations of Seller set forth in Section 6.1 from being
satisfied; provided, however, that no Cure Period shall apply to Buyer's
obligations to pay the Escrow Deposit Fund on the date hereof and to pay the
Purchase Price at Closing.

  

  

(d) by written notice of Buyer to Seller, or by Seller to Buyer, if the
Closing does not occur by the date that is twelve (12) months after the date
of this Agreement (such date, the "Outside Date"), unless the Closing has not
occurred by such date as a result of a material breach of this Agreement by
the party providing such notice of termination.

  

  

10.2 Cure Period

  

  

. Each party shall give the other party prompt written notice upon learning of
any breach or default by the other party under this Agreement, and such notice
shall include a description of the breach. The term "Cure Period" as used
herein means a period commencing on the date Buyer or Seller receives from the
other written notice of breach or default hereunder and continuing until the
earlier of (i) thirty (30) calendar days thereafter or (ii) five (5) business
days after the day otherwise scheduled for Closing; provided, however, that if
the breach or default is non-monetary and cannot reasonably be cured within
such period but can be cured before the date five (5) business days after the
scheduled Closing Date, and if diligent efforts to cure promptly commence,
then the Cure Period shall continue as long as such diligent efforts to cure
continue, but not beyond the date five (5) business days after the scheduled
Closing Date.

  

  

10.3 Termination and Survival

  

  

. Subject to Section 10.4 and Section 10.5, in the event of a termination of
this Agreement by either Seller or Buyer as provided in Section 10.1, this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and, subject to Section 10.5,
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Seller, Buyer or
their respective directors, officers, employees, incorporators, members,
partners, equityholders, Affiliates, agents, attorneys or representatives;
provided that the provisions of this Section 10.3 and Section 5.1
(Confidentiality), Section 10.5 (Liquidated Damages), Section 10.6 (Return of
Escrow Deposit), Section 11.1 (Expenses), Section 11.6 (Entire Agreement),
Section 11.9 (Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial),
Section 11.10 (Neutral Construction), Section 11.12 (Counterparts; Delivery by
Facsimile/Email) and Section 11.13 (Interpretation) shall remain in full force
and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement; provided, however,
that, subject to Section 10.5, any such termination shall not relieve any
party of any liability for any breach or default that occurred prior to such
termination.

  

  

10.4 Specific Performance

  

  

.

  

  

(a) Subject to Sections 10.4(b), 10.5 and 1.8, the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the parties hereto would be irreparably damaged if any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or are otherwise breached and that any non-performance or
breach of this Agreement by any party hereto could not be adequately
compensated by monetary damages alone and that the parties hereto would not
have any adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in addition to any other right
or remedy to which any party hereto may be entitled, at law or in equity
(including monetary damages), subject to Sections 10.4(b), 10.5 and 1.8, prior
to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, such party
shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of
specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief, subject to obtaining any required Governmental Consents, to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement
without posting any bond or other undertaking. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that, subject to Section 10.4(b),
the party seeking specific performance shall be entitled to enforce
specifically (a) a party's obligations under Section 1.9; (b) Buyer's
obligation (subject to Section 5.17) to draw upon and cause the Financing to
be funded, if available; and (c) a party's obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the obligation to
consummate the Closing and to pay the Purchase Price, if applicable), if the
conditions set forth in Article 6 or Article 7, as applicable, have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) or waived.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that Seller shall
be entitled to seek specific performance of Buyer's obligation to consummate
the Closing (including Seller's obligation to cause the High Plains Entities
to consummate the sale of the High Plains Purchased Assets in accordance with
the Option Agreement and the Option Exercise Agreement) if and only if (i) all
of the conditions set forth in Article 6 and Article 7 have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature would be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to such conditions being satisfied assuming a Closing
would occur) and nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause
the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Article 6 and Article 7 to
be satisfied, (ii) Buyer is required to complete the Closing pursuant to
Section 1.8(a) but has failed to do so as of two (2) business days following
the receipt of Seller's confirmation referred to in clause (iv), (iii) the
Financing has been funded or the provider(s) of the Financing have
acknowledged in writing that the Financing will be funded at the Closing and
(iv) Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing that, if an order of specific
performance is granted and the Financing is funded, then Seller would perform
its obligations to consummate the Closing and the Closing would occur. Without
limiting the foregoing, Seller agrees that Buyer may enforce Seller's rights
the High Plains Entities' obligations under the Option Agreement (as that term
is defined in the Option Exercise Agreement), as it relates to the Stations,
and under the Option Exercise Agreement directly against the High Plains
Entities.

  

  

10.5 Liquidated Damages

  

  

. If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(c) (only in a
situation where (a) all of the conditions set forth in Article 6 and Article 7
(other than those conditions that (i) by their nature would be satisfied at
the Closing by actions that Seller has indicated in writing to Buyer that
Seller is willing and able to take or (ii) are unsatisfied as a result of
Buyer's breach of its obligations under this Agreement and the failure of such
breach to be cured within the Cure Period to the extent provided herein) have
been satisfied or waived), then the Escrow Deposit Fund shall be paid to
Seller (or Seller's designee) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement, and such payment shall constitute liquidated damages. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that the recovery of the Escrow Deposit Fund as set
forth herein shall constitute payment of liquidated damages and not a penalty
and that such liquidated damages amount is reasonable in light of the
substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused by Buyer's
material breach or default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof of
loss and damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining
an adequate remedy, and the value of the transactions to be consummated
hereunder. Seller acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, if it terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1,
or in any other event prior to the occurrence of the Closing, Seller's sole
and exclusive remedy hereunder shall be the right (if any) to seek payment
from the Escrow Deposit Fund pursuant to this Section 10.5 (or, in the
alternative, and solely under the circumstances described in Section 10.4(b),
the right to specific performance by Buyer of the transactions to be
consummated at the Closing. Except in the case of fraud with scienter, in no
event shall any party be liable for punitive damages.

  

  

10.6 Return of Escrow Deposit

  

  

. In all cases other than a termination of this Agreement by Seller as
described in Section 10.5, which shall result in the payment of the Escrow
Deposit Fund to Seller (or Seller's designee) in accordance with Section 10.5
hereof, the Escrow Deposit Fund shall be released to Buyer upon a termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  

  

ARTICLE 11

  

  

MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

11.1 Expenses

  

  

. Except as may be otherwise specified herein, each party shall be solely
responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the
negotiation, preparation and performance of and compliance with the terms of
this Agreement. If more than one HSR Act filing is necessary because a party
has more than one ultimate parent entity, then such party shall pay the HSR
Act filing fees for any additional filings. Buyer shall pay one-half (1/2) and
Seller shall pay one-half (1/2) of all governmental Taxes, fees and charges
applicable to the transfer of the Purchased Assets under this Agreement
(including sales, use and real property transfer taxes and the costs of
recording or filing all applicable conveyance instruments) (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes"). The parties will cooperate in the preparation, execution
and filing of all Tax Returns regarding Transfer Taxes and in seeking or
perfecting any available exemption from Transfer Taxes. Each party is
responsible for any commission, brokerage fee, advisory fee or other similar
payment that arises as a result of any agreement or action of it or any party
acting on its behalf in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. In the event of any litigation regarding or arising from
this Agreement prior to the Closing, the prevailing party as determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction in a final non-appealable judgment shall be
entitled to recover its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys'
fees and expenses) incurred therein or in the enforcement or collection of any
judgment or award rendered therein.

  

  

11.2 Further Assurances

  

  

. After Closing, each party shall from time to time, at the request of and
without further cost or expense to the other, execute and deliver such other
instruments of conveyance and assumption and take such other actions as may
reasonably be requested in order to more effectively consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

11.3 Assignment

  

  

. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other party hereto, provided, however that Buyer may by written notice
to, but without consent of, Seller, assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to an Affiliate of Buyer, provided that any such assignment does not
materially delay the processing of the FCC Application, the grant of the FCC
Consent, the HSR Clearance or the Closing. The terms of this Agreement shall
bind and inure to the benefit of the parties' respective successors and any
permitted assigns, and no assignment shall relieve any party of any obligation
or liability under this Agreement.

. Any notice pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed delivered on the date of personal delivery or confirmed facsimile
transmission or confirmed delivery by a nationally recognized overnight

being valid and enforceable under applicable law, (b) the application of such
provision to any other party or to any other circumstance will not be affected
or impaired thereby and (c) the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to the Covered Matters, except for documents, agreements and

irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and, in the
case of appeals, appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action
and irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of any such action or proceeding. The consents to jurisdiction set forth in
this Section 11.9 shall not constitute general consents to service of process
in the State of New York and shall have no effect for any purpose except as
provided in this Section 11.9 and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any
third party. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such Action
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

  

  

(c) BUYER AND SELLER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN

BUYER OR SELLER IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

that the final terms hereof are the product of the parties' negotiations. This

investigation, defense or prosecution of any third party Action which is
pending or threatened against either party or its Affiliates with respect to

the other of a claim for indemnity with respect to such matter. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall make available its
Transferred Employees to give depositions or testimony and shall furnish all
documentary or other evidence that Seller may reasonably request. Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for all reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket third party
expenses incurred in connection with the performance of Buyer's obligations

effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.

each other party hereto or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and
deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such agreement or
instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or email to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or email as
a defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract and each such party
forever waives any such defense.
