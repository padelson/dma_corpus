respect of such shares of Non-Accelerated First Surviving Corporation Stock
shall be subject to the same vesting conditions and schedule that applied to
such shares of Non-Accelerated First Surviving Corporation Stock immediately
prior to the Merger 2 Effective 

 



-38-  Time (such consideration described in this proviso, the " _Unvested Merger 2

3.3 _Estimated Transaction Consideration_.

 

(a) _Determination and Allocation of Estimated Transaction Consideration_.

 

(i) No later than three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date, the
Partnership shall deliver to Parent (A) the Partnerships good faith
calculation and estimate of the aggregate amount of the Estimated Transaction
Consideration, the aggregate amount of the Closing Cash Consideration, the
aggregate amount of the Stock Consideration and each of the Estimated
Transaction Consideration Elements (including its good faith estimate of the
Applicable Share Price) and (B) an Allocation Schedule based on such
calculations and estimates. The calculations described above in the foregoing
clause (A), together with the Allocation Schedule, are collectively referred
to herein as the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ". In connection therewith,
the Partnership shall, from and after the delivery of the Estimated Closing
Statement, (x) keep Parent reasonably informed of the Partnerships
calculations of the Estimated Transaction Consideration and the Allocation
Schedule (including Estimated Net Working Capital) and (y) provide Parent with
reasonable access to such books, records, contracts and other documents of
the Partnership or its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request in order
for Parent to review such calculation. The Partnership shall consider in good
faith any comments, objections and suggestions that Parent has with regard to
such calculation and the Partnership may, notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the good faith determination of the Partnership, revise such calculation to
take all or a portion of such comments, objections and suggestions into
account and redeliver to Parent a revised Estimated Closing Statement, it
being

 



-39-  understood and agreed, however, that the final calculation of the Estimated
Transaction Consideration, the aggregate amount of the Closing Cash
Consideration, the aggregate amount of the Stock Consideration, each of the
Estimated Transaction Consideration Elements and the Allocation Schedule will
be as determined by the Partnership in its sole discretion, even if Parent has
not agreed with such calculation. No later than the 5:00 p.m. New York City
time on the Business Day immediately preceding the Closing Date, Parent shall
deliver a written notice to the Partnership specifying the number of
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock as of the open of business on the
Closing Date. In addition, the parties understand and acknowledge that the
Applicable Share Price will not be known until the close of trading of The
Nasdaq Stock Market on the last trading day immediately before the Closing
Date and as a result, the Partnership shall redeliver to Parent a revised
Estimated Closing Statement following the close of trading of The Nasdaq Stock
Market on the last trading day immediately before the Closing Date and prior
to the Closing, updated solely to give effect to the actual Applicable Share
Price. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the terms of (including the definitions contained in) this
Agreement, including _Exhibit A_ and, with respect to Estimated Net
Working Capital, _Exhibit B_.

(ii) The Estimated Transaction Consideration shall be allocated to each
Unitholder in accordance with the Allocation Schedule (it being understood
that the Estimated Transaction Consideration allocated to each individual
Unitholder shall be the aggregate amount that would be allocated to such
Unitholder if all of the assets and liabilities of the Partnership were sold
in an all-cash transaction for the Estimated Transaction Consideration and all
of the cash proceeds of such sale were distributed to the Unitholders (taking
into account each class, series, tranche or type within a class, series or
tranche of the Units and the vesting requirements, Threshold Equity Value (as
defined in the Partnership Agreement) and Class D Threshold Equity Value (as
defined in the Partnership Agreement), as applicable, with respect to such
Units) pursuant to Section 8.1(b) of the Partnership Agreement, giving effect
to Sections 8.1(c), 8.1(d) and 8.1(e) of the Partnership Agreement, but, for
the avoidance of doubt, not treating any portion of such distribution as an
Excess Free Cash Flow Distribution (as defined in the Partnership Agreement).

(b) _Payment of Estimated Transaction Consideration_.

 

(i) _Paying Agent; Paying Agent Fund_. At the Merger 1 Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, in
trust for the benefit of the Unitholders and Seller, (x) cash in immediately
available funds payable to the Unitholders and Seller pursuant to this
_Article III_ in an amount equal to the Closing Cash Consideration (less any
portion thereof that shall constitute Unvested Merger 2 Consideration) and (y)
stock certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(or, if applicable, Parent Series D Preferred Stock and Parent Series E
Preferred Stock) necessary to make all payments of the Stock Consideration
pursuant to this _Article III_ (less any portion thereof that shall constitute
Unvested Merger 2 Consideration). Any cash and shares of Parent Common Stock
(or, if applicable, Parent Series D Preferred Stock and Parent Series E
Preferred Stock) deposited with the Paying Agent, together with any interest
or other earnings thereon shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Paying
Agent Fund_ ". Parent shall also deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent from time to time as needed and on a prompt basis
additional cash in immediately available funds sufficient to pay any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which Seller and the
Unitholders are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_.

 



-40- (ii) _Payment_. Subject to compliance by Seller and each Unitholder that holds
Units (other than the Specified Units) immediately prior to the Merger 1
Effective Time with _Section 3.3(c)_, at the Closing, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be distributed from the Paying Agent Fund
to (A) each Unitholder that holds Units (other than Specified Units)
immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time an amount of cash equal to
the Merger 2 Cash Consideration and an amount of shares of Parent Common Stock
(or, if applicable Parent Series D Preferred Stock and Parent Series E
Preferred Stock) equal to the Merger 2 Stock Consideration, in each case in
respect of the shares (excluding Specified Shares) of First Surviving
Corporation Stock into which the Units (excluding Specified Units) that
such Unitholder holds immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time are
converted pursuant to Merger 1 (which aggregate amounts per Unitholder shall
be set forth in the Allocation Schedule) and (B) Seller an amount of cash
equal to the Closing Purchase Price and an amount of shares of Parent Common
Stock (or, if applicable Parent Series D Preferred Stock and Parent Series E
Preferred Stock) equal to the Stock Purchase Price (which amounts shall be set
forth in the Allocation Schedule). The Closing Cash Consideration payable to
Seller or the Unitholders and any additional payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares contemplated by _Section 3.3(g)_ shall be paid to Seller
and such Unitholders, in each case, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. The Closing Cash Consideration and any additional payment of cash in
lieu of fractional shares contemplated by _Section 3.3(g)_ paid to Seller and
the Unitholders shall be paid to the account of Seller or such Unitholders,
as applicable, which account shall be (x) identified to Parent in writing by
Seller or such Unitholders, as applicable, or by the Partnership on Sellers
or such Unitholders behalf, no later than two (2) Business Days prior the
Closing Date or (y) as set forth in the Letter of Transmittal delivered by
Seller or such Unitholders pursuant to _Section 3.3(c)_. The Stock
Consideration payable to Seller or the Unitholders shall be issued to Seller
and such Unitholders in the form of stock certificates, in each case, in the
name, and at the address, of Seller or such Unitholders, as applicable, (A)
provided to Parent in writing by Seller or such Unitholders, as applicable,
or by the Partnership on Sellers or such Unitholders behalf, no later than
two (2) Business Days prior the Closing Date, or (B) as set forth in the
Letter of Transmittal delivered by Seller or such Unitholders pursuant to
_Section 3.3(c)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any delay in delivering such
wire instructions or addresses shall be without prejudice to Sellers or such
Unitholders right to receive any of the Closing Cash Consideration or the
Stock Consideration, which shall be paid promptly after the later of the
Closing Date and the date of receipt of such wire instructions and/or address.
If and when the applicable vesting conditions and schedule that applied to an
outstanding share of Non-Accelerated First Surviving Corporation Stock
immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time have been satisfied after the
Merger 2 Effective Time, Parent shall promptly thereafter deliver to the
former holder thereof, with respect to such Non-Accelerated First Surviving
Corporation Stock, the Unvested Merger 2 Consideration such Non-Accelerated
First Surviving Corporation Stock is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section3.2(b)(iii)_. The Additional Transaction Consideration (if any) (as
set forth in the Final Closing Statement) will be paid to Seller and each
Unitholder pursuant to _Section 3.7(f)_.

 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Prior to the Closing, the Partnership shall mail or
otherwise deliver, or cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise deliver, to
Seller and each

 



-41-  Unitholder a (i) Letter of Transmittal, substantially in the form of
_Exhibit D_ attached hereto with such changes thereto as may be reasonably
required by the Paying Agent (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), which, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall include the obligation of Seller and each
Unitholder to agree to _Sections 3.9_ , _3.10_ , _3.11_ , _3.12_ and _3.13_ of
this Agreement and (ii) subject to the satisfaction of the Lock-Up
Conditions, a Lock-Up Agreement. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
in _Article VIII_ , in the event Seller or a Unitholder does not deliver to
the Paying Agent a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal at or
prior to the Closing or, if required, a Lock-Up Agreement to Parent at or
prior to the Closing, such failure shall not alter, limit or delay the
Closing; _provided_ , that Seller shall not be entitled to receive any of the
Purchase Price or such Unitholder shall not be entitled to receive (with
respect to First Surviving Corporation Stock held by such Unitholder) any of
the Merger 2 Consideration or Additional Transaction Consideration (if any),
in each case as contemplated herein unless and until such Person delivers a
duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent and, if
required, a duly executed and completed Lock-Up Agreement to Parent. Upon the
delivery to the Paying Agent of a duly executed Letter of Transmittal and, if
required, the delivery to Parent of a duly executed and completed Lock-Up
Agreement, Seller shall be entitled to receive, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Purchase Price and each such Unitholder shall be
entitled to receive (with respect to First Surviving Corporation Stock held by
such Unitholder), subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Merger 2
Consideration and the Additional Consideration (if any). Until a duly
executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and, if required, Lock-Up
Agreement is delivered by Seller or a Unitholder, as the case may be, to the
Paying Agent, such Persons membership interest in the General Partner and/or
such Persons Units and shares of First Surviving Corporation Stock shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Times to represent only the right to
receive upon such delivery the Purchase Price (in the case of the Seller) or
the Merger 1 Consideration, Merger 2 Consideration and Additional Transaction
Consideration (if any) (in the case of the Unitholders), in each case as
contemplated herein. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Lock-
Up Agreement shall be required in order for Seller or the Unitholders to
receive the Purchase Price (in the case of the Seller) or the Merger 1
Consideration, Merger 2 Consideration (including the Closing Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration) and the Additional
Transaction Consideration (if any) (in the case of the Unitholders) hereunder
unless each of the following has been satisfied (the " _Lock-Up Conditions_
"): (x) the Offering is consummated at or prior to the Closing, (y) the
directors and officers of Parent enter into a substantially identical
underwriters lock-up agreement with the underwriters of the Offering as the
Lock-Up Agreement to be entered into by Seller and the Unitholders and (z) the
Lock-Up Agreement to be entered into by Seller and the Unitholders is made
available to the Partnership for distribution to the Seller and the
Unitholders at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. If
there is no Threshold Cash Increase, unless otherwise designated in a
holders duly executed Letter of Transmittal (or supplement thereto), for
purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.358-2(a)(2)(ii), holders of First
Surviving Corporation Stock will be treated as having surrendered, in
exchange for the Closing Cash Consideration received by such holder, a
percentage of the total shares of First Surviving Corporation Stock held by
such holder that equals the percentage that the Closing Cash Consideration
represents of the sum of (x) the Closing Cash Consideration and (y) the Stock
Consideration Value; and (ii) for purposes of clause (i), the shares of First
Surviving Corporation Stock surrendered by a holder in exchange for the
Closing Cash Consideration received by such holder will be deemed to be,
first, those shares with the lowest share certificate number in the stock
ledger of Sunbeam Primary, in ascending order until the Closing Cash
Consideration has been fully paid.

 



-42- (d) _No Further Ownership Rights_.

 

(i) All shares of First Surviving Corporation Stock and Additional Transaction
Consideration (if any) paid upon the surrender of Units in accordance with
the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Units previously represented by
book-entry. From and after the Merger 1 Effective Time, the transfer books
of the Partnership shall be closed and there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the transfer books of the Partnership of the Units that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time.

 

(ii) All Merger 2 Consideration (including the Closing Cash Consideration and
the Stock Consideration) paid upon the surrender of shares of First Surviving
Corporation Stock in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of First Surviving Corporation Stock previously represented by book-
entry. From and after the Merger 2 Effective Time, the transfer books of the
First Surviving Corporation shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the transfer books of the First Surviving
Corporation of the shares of First Surviving Corporation Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 2 Effective Time.

(iii) If there is no Threshold Cash Increase and Merger 3 is consummated as
described in _Section 2.2(c)_ above, from and after the Merger 3 Effective
Time, the transfer books of the Second Surviving Corporation shall be closed
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the transfer books
of the Second Surviving Corporation of the shares of Second Surviving
Corporation Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Merger 3
Effective Time.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Parent Parties, Seller, the General Partner,
the Partnership, Sunbeam Primary, the Unitholders Representative, the Paying
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Termination of the Paying Agent Fund_. Any portion of the Paying Agent
Fund which remains undistributed to Seller and the Unitholders for twelve
(12) months after the Merger 2 Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
and Seller or any Unitholder, to the extent such Person has not theretofore
complied with _Section 3.3(c)_, shall thereafter look only to Parent for,
and, subject to _Section 3.3(e)_ above, Parent shall remain liable for, the
portion of the Merger 2 Consideration (including the Closing Cash
Consideration and the Stock Consideration) and Additional
Transaction Consideration (if any) to which Seller or such Unitholder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Any such portion of the Paying Agent Fund
remaining unclaimed by Seller or the Unitholders six (6) years after the
Merger 2 Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time
as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority) shall, to the extent permitted by Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



-43- (g) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued
pursuant to this Agreement. If a Unitholder would be entitled to receive a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Allocation Schedule,
in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common Stock, such Unitholder
shall receive cash (rounded to the nearest cent), without interest, in an
amount equal to the product of (i) the Applicable Share Price and (ii) the
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such Unitholder would
otherwise be entitled, and the Stock Consideration shall be reduced by the
amount of such fractional share.

 

(h) _Delivery of Additional Cash Consideration in Lieu of Stock
Consideration_. If Parent consummates an Offering prior to Closing, Parent
shall deliver a Closing Cash Consideration Increase Notice to the Unitholders
Representative no later than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date
that increases the Total Cash Amount by an amount equal to the
Offering Proceeds. Parent may, at its discretion and regardless of whether
Parent consummates an Offering, elect to increase the Total Cash Amount, as
reflected in a Closing Cash Consideration Increase Notice, by an amount in
excess of the Offering Proceeds. 

3.4 _Escrow Accounts_. Simultaneously with the Closing, Parent shall deliver,
or cause to be delivered, to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreements, as applicable: (a) an amount of cash in immediately
available funds equal to the Working Capital Escrow Amount to be held in the
Working Capital Escrow Account and (b) an amount of cash in immediately
available funds equal to the Unitholders Representative Escrow Amount to be
held in the Unitholders Representative Escrow Account.

 

3.5 _Transaction Costs_. Simultaneously with the Closing, Parent shall pay, or
cause to be paid, the Transaction Costs by wire transfer of immediately
available funds as directed by each payee thereof.

3.6 _Certain Indebtedness_. Simultaneously with the Closing, Parent shall
repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries, any outstanding amount of Indebtedness of the Partnership and
its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Credit Agreements by wire transfer of
immediately available funds as directed by Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands
Branch, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent thereunder.
Simultaneously with the Closing, with respect to each of the letters of credit
of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries issued pursuant to Indebtedness of
the Partnership and its Subsidiaries or commitments under agreements governing
Indebtedness of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries, Parent shall cause such
letter of credit to be returned to the issuers thereof, provide to the issuer
of such letter of credit a letter of credit in the same amount, on terms
satisfactory to the issuers of such letters of credit, or otherwise satisfy
the issuers of such letters of credit as to the disposition or retention of
such letters of credit under the applicable credit facilities (e.g., cash
collateralizing such obligations).

 



-44- 3.7 _Post-Closing Determination of Additional Transaction Consideration_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date until the determination of the Final
Closing Statement pursuant to this _Section 3.7_, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, permit
the Unitholders Representative and its Representatives reasonable access to
the personnel and accountants of the General Partner, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and provide reasonable access
(with the right to make copies), during business hours upon reasonable advance
notice, to the books, records, contracts and other documents (including
auditors work papers) of the General Partner, the Surviving Corporation
and/or its Subsidiaries that are or could reasonably be relevant to the
calculations set forth in the Closing Statement, a Dispute Notice or otherwise
related to the negotiation and/or resolution of the Final Closing Statement.

(b) Following the Closing, Parent shall prepare a good faith calculation of
the Final Transaction Consideration, the Final Transaction Consideration
Elements and the Additional Transaction Consideration (if any). The
calculations described under the foregoing sentence are collectively referred
to herein as the " _Closing Statement_ ". Parent shall deliver the Closing
Statement, together with reasonable supporting detail as to each of the
calculations (including with respect to the Final Transaction Consideration
Elements) set forth in the Closing Statement, to the
Unitholders Representative no later than sixty (60) days following the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties
agree that the Closing Statement, and the component items and calculations
therein, including the Final Transaction Consideration Elements, shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with the terms of (including the definitions
contained in) this Agreement, including _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit B_ attached
to this Agreement with respect to Net Working Capital. The Closing Statement
shall be conclusive, final and binding on all parties absent manifest error
unless the Unitholders Representative gives Parent written notice (a "
_Dispute Notice_ ") of any disputes or objections thereto (collectively, the
" _Disputed Items_ ") with reasonable supporting detail as to such Disputed
Items, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Closing Statement
(such period, the " _Review Period_ "). In the event the Unitholders
Representative fails to give Parent a Dispute Notice prior to the expiration
of the Review Period or otherwise earlier notifies Parent in writing that the
Unitholders Representative has no disputes or objections to the Closing
Statement, the Working Capital Escrow Account shall be distributed, and
payments shall be made by Parent, in accordance with _Section 3.7(f)_. In the
event the Unitholders Representative gives Parent a Dispute Notice prior to
the expiration of the Review Period then, within two (2) Business Days after
such Dispute Notice has been given to Parent, Parent and the Unitholders
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to make the distributions in accordance with _Section 3.7(f)(iii)_, solely to
the extent applicable in light of, and to the extent which, the Unitholders
Representative has not objected to the calculation set forth in the Closing
Statement and by way of example, (1) if the Final Transaction Consideration
set forth in the Closing Statement is higher than the Estimated Transaction
Consideration, Parent and the Unitholders Representative shall provide a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release all amounts in the
Working Capital Escrow Account to Seller and the Unitholders in accordance
with _Section 3.7(f)(iii)_ and (2) if the Final Transaction Consideration
set forth in the Closing Statement is less than the Estimated Transaction
Consideration, then Parent and the Unitholders Representative shall provide a
joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release an amount equal to
the excess (if any) of (A) all amounts in the Working Capital Escrow

 



-45-  Account, over (B) (x) the Estimated Transaction Consideration, _minus_ (y)
the Final Transaction Consideration set forth in the Closing Statement, to
Seller and the Unitholders in accordance with _Section 3.7(f)(iii)_.

(c) Parent and the Unitholders Representative shall, for a period of thirty
(30) days (or such longer period as Parent and the Unitholders Representative
may agree in writing) following delivery of a Dispute Notice to Parent (the "
_Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith to resolve their differences
(all such discussions and communications related thereto shall (unless
otherwise agreed by Parent and the Unitholders Representative in writing) be
governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any
applicable similar state rule), and any such resolution by them as to any
Disputed Items shall be conclusive, final and binding on all parties absent
manifest error. Any Disputed Items agreed to by Parent and the Unitholders
Representative in writing, together with any items or calculations set forth
in the Closing Statement not disputed or objected to by the Unitholders
Representative in the Dispute Notice, are collectively referred to herein as
the " _Resolved Matters_ ". Any Resolved Matters shall be conclusive, final
and binding on all parties absent manifest error, except to the extent such
component could be affected by other components of the calculations set forth
in the Closing Statement that are the subject of a Dispute Notice. If at the
end of the Resolution Period, Parent and the Unitholders Representative have
been unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Dispute Notice, either of Parent or the Unitholders
Representative may, upon written notice to the other, refer all matters that
remain in dispute with respect to the Dispute Notice (the " _Unresolved
Matters_ ") for resolution to the Independent Accountant. If one or more
Unresolved Matters are submitted to the Independent Accountant for resolution,
Parent and the Unitholders Representative shall enter into a customary
engagement letter with, and to the extent necessary each party to this
Agreement will waive and cause its controlling Affiliates to waive any
conflicts with, the Independent Accountant at the time such dispute is
submitted to the Independent Accountant and shall cooperate with the
Independent Accountant in connection with its determination pursuant to this
_Section 3.7_. Within ten (10) days after the Independent Accountant has been
retained, each of Parent and the Unitholders Representative shall furnish, at
its own expense, to the Independent Accountant and substantially
simultaneously to the other a written statement of its position with respect
to each Unresolved Matter. Within five (5) Business Days after the expiration
of such ten (10) day period, each of Parent and the Unitholders
Representative may deliver to the Independent Accountant its response to the
others position on each Unresolved Matter; _provided_ , that it delivers a
copy thereof substantially simultaneously to the other. With each submission,
each of Parent and the Unitholders Representative may also furnish to the
Independent Accountant such other information and documents as it deems
relevant or such information and documents as may be requested by the
Independent Accountant; _provided_ , that it delivers a copy thereof
substantially simultaneously to the other. The Independent Accountant may, at
its discretion, conduct one or more conferences (whether in person or by
teleconference) concerning the disagreement and each of Parent and the
Unitholders Representative shall have the right to present additional
documents, materials and other information and to have present its
Representatives at such conferences.

 

(d) The Independent Accountant shall be directed to promptly, and in any event
within thirty (30) days after its appointment pursuant to  _Section 3.7(c)_,
render its decision on the Unresolved Matters (and not on any other matter or
calculation set forth in the Closing

 



-46-  Statement). The Independent Accountants determination as to each Unresolved
Matter shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to each of Parent
and the Unitholders Representative, which shall include the Independent
Accountants (i) determination as to the calculation of each of the Unresolved
Matters and (ii) the corresponding corrective calculations set forth in the
Closing Statement that are derived from its determination as to the
calculation of each of the Unresolved Matters, all of which shall be
conclusive, final and binding on all parties absent manifest error. In
resolving any Unresolved Matter, the Independent Accountant may not assign a
value to such item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
Parent in the Closing Statement or by the Unitholders Representative in the
Dispute Notice or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by Parent
in the Closing Statement or by the Unitholders Representative in the Dispute
Notice. The Independent Accountant shall also determine the proportion of its
fees and expenses to be paid by each of Parent and the Unitholders
Representative based on the degree (as determined by the Independent
Accountant) to which the Independent Accountant has accepted the positions of
Parent and the Unitholders Representative. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Independent Accountants fees and expenses payable by Parent (if any) shall
be paid to the Independent Accountant directly by Parent, and the Independent
Accountants fees and expenses payable by the Unitholders Representative (if
any) shall only be paid from the funds in the Unitholders Representative
Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 3.11_ and in accordance with the
Unitholders Representative Escrow Agreement. To the extent the funds then
held in the Unitholders Representative Escrow Account are insufficient to
cover all of the Independent Accountants fees and expenses payable by the
Unitholders Representative, the Unitholders Representative shall pay such
fees and expenses within ten (10) Business Days following written demand from
such Independent Accountant (it being understood and agreed that Seller and
the Unitholders shall each, severally and not jointly, promptly pay the
Unitholders Representative their respective Pro Rata Portion of such fees in
accordance with _Section 3.12_).

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Final Closing Statement_ " shall
be (i) in the event that no Dispute Notice is delivered by the Unitholders
Representative to Parent prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the
Closing Statement delivered by Parent to the Unitholders Representative
pursuant to _Section 3.7(b)_, (ii) in the event that a Dispute Notice is
delivered by the Unitholders Representative to Parent prior to the expiration
of the Review Period, the Closing Statement delivered by Parent to the
Unitholders Representative pursuant to _Section 3.7(b)_, as adjusted
pursuant to the agreement of Parent and the Unitholders Representative in
writing, or (iii) in the event that a Dispute Notice is delivered by the
Unitholders Representative to Parent prior to the expiration of the Review
Period and Parent and the Unitholders Representative are unable to agree on
all matters set forth in such Dispute Notice, the Closing Statement
delivered by Parent to the Unitholders Representative pursuant to _Section
3.7(b)_, as adjusted by the Independent Account to be consistent with (A) the
Resolved Matters and (B) the Independent Accountants determination as to the
calculation of the Unresolved Matters in accordance with _Sections 3.7(c)_
and _3.7(d)_.

(f) _Payment of the Additional Transaction Consideration_.

(i) If the Final Transaction Consideration exceeds the Estimated Transaction
Consideration, then within two (2) Business Days after the final
determination of the Final Closing Statement, Parent shall deposit, in
immediately available funds, with the Escrow

 



-47-  Agent in the Working Capital Escrow Account an amount in cash equal to the
lesser of (x) the full amount by which the Final Transaction Consideration
exceeds the Estimated Transaction Consideration and (y) the Working Capital
Escrow Amount, and immediately thereafter, Parent and the Unitholders
Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent
to deliver promptly from the Working Capital Escrow Account by wire transfer
of immediately available funds in accordance with the Working Capital Escrow
Agreement all proceeds then in the Working Capital Escrow Account, after
giving effect to the last sentence of _Section 3.7(b)_, to the Unitholders
and Seller, in each case as set forth in _Section 3.7(f)(iii)_.

(ii) If (x) the Estimated Transaction Consideration exceeds the Final
Transaction Consideration or (y) the Final Transaction Consideration equals
the Estimated Transaction Consideration, then within two (2) Business Days
after the final determination of the Final Closing Statement, Parent and the
Unitholders Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Working Capital Escrow Account by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the Working
Capital Escrow Agreement (A) the full amount by which the Estimated
Transaction Consideration exceeds the Final Transaction Consideration to
Parent and (B) the funds remaining in the Working Capital Escrow Account,
after giving effect to the last sentence of _Section 3.7(b)_ and clause (A)
of this _Section 3.7(f)(ii)_ (if any) to the Unitholders and Seller, as set
forth in _Section 3.7(f)(iii)_. In the event that the full amount by
which the Estimated Transaction Consideration exceeds the Final Transaction
Consideration is greater than the funds then held in the Working Capital
Escrow Account, Parent shall have no recourse against the Unitholders
Representative, the Unitholders, Seller or any other Person.

(iii) All distributions of funds to Seller and the Unitholders after the
distribution of the Merger 2 Consideration, including the distribution of
funds from the Working Capital Escrow Account and the Unitholders
Representative Escrow Account as contemplated in, and subject to the
circumstances set forth in this Agreement, including the last sentence of
_Section 3.7(b)_, _Section 3.7(f)(i)_, _Section 3.7(f)(ii)_ and _Section
3.13_, as applicable, shall be made as follows:

 

(A) to the Unitholders Representative Escrow Account, solely to the extent
directed by the Unitholders Representative pursuant to _Section 3.11(b)_;
and

(B) only after giving full effect to clause (A) of this  _Section
3.7(f)(iii),_ to (x) each Unitholder that holds any Units (other than
Specified Units) immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time, an amount
equal to the Additional Transaction Consideration (if any) that is
allocable to such Unitholder in respect of the Units (excluding the Specified
Units) that it holds immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time (which
allocable amount shall be set forth on the Final Closing Statement) and (y)
Seller, an amount equal to the Additional Transaction Consideration (if any)
that is allocable to the General Partner in respect of the Units that it holds
immediately prior to the Merger 1 Effective Time (which allocable amount shall
be set forth on the Final Closing Statement).

 



-48- For the avoidance of doubt, each Unitholder (including the General Partner)
shall be allocated an amount of the Additional Transaction Consideration in
respect of the Units held by such Unitholder immediately prior to the Merger 1
Effective Time (with Seller being entitled pursuant to 3.1 to receive payment
of the amount of the Additional Transaction Consideration allocated to the
General Partner as consideration for the Purchase) (it being understood that
the Additional Transaction Consideration allocated to each such individual
Unitholder (including the General Partner) shall be (i) the aggregate amount
that would be allocated to such Unitholder if all of the assets and
liabilities of the Partnership were sold in an all-cash transaction for the
Final Transaction Consideration and all of the cash proceeds of such
sale were distributed to the Unitholders (taking into account each class,
series, tranche or type within a class, series or tranche of the Units and the
vesting requirements, Threshold Equity Value (as defined in the Partnership
Agreement) and Class D Threshold Equity Value (as defined in the Partnership
Agreement), as applicable, with respect to such Units) pursuant to Section
8.1(b) of the Partnership Agreement, giving effect to Sections 8.1(c), 8.1(d)
and 8.1(e) of the Partnership Agreement, but, for the avoidance of doubt, not
treating any portion of such distribution as an Excess Free Cash Flow
Distribution (as defined in the Partnership Agreement), _minus_ (ii) the
aggregate Estimated Transaction Consideration allocated to such Unitholder
pursuant to _Section 3.3(a)_ in respect of the Units of such Unitholder and
all other amounts previously distributed to such Unitholder (or, in the case
of the General Partner, Seller) pursuant to the last sentence of _Section
3.7(b)_, _Section 3.7(f)_ and/or _Section 3.13_ in respect of the Units of
such Unitholder.

 

(g) All payments pursuant to this _Section 3.7_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Final Transaction Consideration for all foreign, federal,
state and local income Tax purposes.

(h) The parties agree that the Unitholders Representative and its
Affiliates may engage Ernst and Young LLP and its Affiliates to advise or
represent them in connection with the determination of any Additional
Transaction Consideration and the matters addressed by this _Section 3.7_.
Each party shall (and shall cause its controlling Affiliates to) enter into
such waivers, indemnities and other agreements as Ernst and Young LLP and/or its
Affiliates shall reasonably require to permit Ernst and Young LLP and its
Affiliates to provide such advice or representation.

3.8 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Partnership, Parent, Sunbeam Primary and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment payable
pursuant to this _Article III_ such amounts as may be required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or
under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Authority; _provided_ ,
that prior to making any such deduction or withholding, the applicable
withholding entity shall provide notice to the recipient of the amounts
subject to withholding and a reasonable opportunity for such recipient to
provide forms or other evidence that would exempt such amounts from

paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

shall be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as or by the

obligations hereunder as may be determined by a final, non-appealable order of
a court of competent jurisdiction.

 

3.10 _Actions of the Unitholders  Representative_. A decision, act, consent
or instruction of the Unitholders Representative (acting in its capacity as
the Unitholders Representative) shall constitute a decision of Seller and all
the Unitholders and shall be conclusive, final and binding upon Seller and
each such Unitholder, and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Unitholders Representative as being the
decision, act, consent or instruction of Seller and each such Unitholder. Each
of the Parent Parties and the Surviving Corporation is hereby relieved from
any liability to any Person for any acts done by any Parent Party or the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Unitholders Representative.

 

3.11 _Unitholders  Representative Expenses Consideration_.

 

(a) All fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Unitholders Representative
pursuant to this Agreement, including any fees, costs and expenses of the

of the Unitholders with respect to any action taken, omitted to be taken, or
suffered by it in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent,
statement or other documents believed by it to be genuinely and duly
authorized, nor for any other action or inaction except its own Willful
Breach as may be determined in a final, non-appealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction. The Unitholders Representative may, in all questions
arising under this Agreement, or any other agreement (including the Escrow
Agreements) in connection with this Agreement, rely on the advice of counsel,
accountants and other advisors, and the Unitholders Representative shall not
be liable to Seller and/or any of the Unitholders for anything done, omitted
or suffered in good faith by the Unitholders Representative based on such
advice. The Unitholders Representative is authorized by Seller and each of
the Unitholders to incur expenses on behalf of Seller and the Unitholders in
acting hereunder. If the Unitholders Representative shall incur any
Liability, loss, cost or expense in connection with acting as such that is not
satisfied in full pursuant to a distribution or payment from an Escrow
Account, Seller and each of the Unitholders will, on the written request of
the Unitholders Representative, reimburse the Unitholders Representative for
its Pro Rata Portion of such Liability, loss, cost or expense. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Unitholders Representative is
authorized to deduct (or to cause to be deducted) from any payment or release
due to Seller or any of the Unitholders from any Escrow Account pursuant to
this Agreement the amount of such reimbursement. The parties
hereto understand and agree that the Unitholders Representative, its
Affiliates, partners, members, officers, directors, employees, agents and
Representatives are acting solely on behalf of and as agents for Seller and
the Unitholders and not in their personal capacity, and in no event shall the
Unitholders Representative, or any of its past, present and future
Affiliates, partners, members, stockholders, officers, directors, employees,
agents, Representatives, successors, predecessors, assigns and controlling
persons, and any past, present and future Affiliates, partners, members,
stockholders, officers, directors, employees, agents, Representatives,
successors, predecessors, assigns and controlling persons of any of the
foregoing be liable to Seller or any of the Unitholders hereunder or under the
Escrow Agreements. The term " _Pro Rata Portion_ " means, with respect to
Seller or a given Unitholder and a given amount (such given amount, the "
_Divisible Share_ "), (i) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of
Final Transaction Consideration actually distributed to such Person and the
denominator of which is the Final Transaction Consideration,  _multiplied_ by
(ii) the Divisible Share.

 



-51- (b) Each Unitholder and Seller agrees to indemnify the Unitholders
Representative and its Affiliates, partners, members, officers, directors,
employees, agents and Representatives for its respective Pro Rata Portion of
any and all Liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses
of any legal counsel retained by the Unitholders Representative) or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be
imposed on, or incurred by, or asserted against the
Unitholders Representative or any of its Affiliates, partners, members,
officers, directors, employees, agents or Representatives in any way relating
to or arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
the Unitholders Representatives duties hereunder or under the Escrow
Agreements or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the enforcement of any
of the terms hereof or thereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no Unitholder
or Seller shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise
from the Unitholders Representatives Willful Breach as may be determined in
a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. The
Unitholders Representative shall be fully justified in refusing to take or to
continue to take any action hereunder unless it shall first be fully
indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Unitholders and Seller
(based on their respective Pro Rata Portions) against any and all liability
and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to
take any such action.

 

(c) All obligations of the Unitholders Representative under this Agreement
shall terminate upon the final distribution of the funds in all of the
remaining Escrow Accounts.

3.13 _Release of Unitholders  Representative Escrow Amount_. The escrow
period for the Unitholders Representative Escrow Account shall terminate as
may be determined by the Unitholders Representative. The remaining funds in
the Unitholders Representative Escrow Account shall then be released as set
forth in  _Section 3.7(f)(iii)_.

other Contracts or arrangements related to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Debt Financing other than as expressly
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter furnished to the Partnership pursuant
to this  _Section 6.11_. As of the date hereof, none of the Parent Parties
has received any written notice of default or event that with notice or lapse
of time, or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of any of
the Parent Parties or any of their respective Affiliates or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, any other Person, in each case under the Debt Commitment Letter.
Assuming the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1_ and _Section 8.2_ are
satisfied at Closing, the aggregate proceeds contemplated to be provided
under the Debt Commitment Letter will, together with cash available to Parent
and its Affiliates, be sufficient for Parent and the Surviving Corporation to
pay and satisfy in full (x) the obligations pursuant to this Agreement to pay
the Merger 1 Consideration, the Merger 2 Consideration and the Additional
Transaction Consideration (if any), (y) all other amounts payable by Parent at
Closing pursuant to _Article III_ , and (z) all fees and expenses of the
Parent Parties and their respective Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Debt Commitment Letter is not
subject to any conditions or other contingencies (including pursuant to any
"flex" provisions in the related fee letter or otherwise) other than as
expressly set forth therein and, as of the date hereof, is in full force and
effect and is the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of
the Parent Parties and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties
thereto, as the case may be, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.
All commitments and other fees required to be paid under the Debt Commitment
Letter prior to the date hereof have been paid in full, and the Parent
Parties are unaware of any fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof that
would reasonably be expected to make any of the assumptions or statements set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter inaccurate or that would reasonably be
expected to cause the Debt Commitment Letter to be ineffective. Assuming the
conditions set forth in _Sections 8.2(a)_ and _8.2(b)_ are satisfied at
Closing, the Parent Parties are not aware of any fact or occurrence existing
on the date hereof that would or would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the Debt Financing not to be satisfied or that the full
amount of the Debt Financing not to be available in full to the Parent
Parties at the Closing Date.

Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other

nor any Subsidiary has received any written notice of any default or event
that with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by
Parent or its Subsidiaries under any Parent Material Contract, except for such
defaults or events that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has, from

Policies_ ") are (i) except for policies that have expired under their terms,
in full force and effect, and neither Parent nor any of Parents Subsidiaries
is in breach or default with respect to any such policy or binder, and (ii)

terms. Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, to the Knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any
of Parents Subsidiaries has, since January 1, 2012, received written notice
of (x) actual or threatened material modification or termination of any
material Parent Insurance Policy, other than premium increases in connection
with Parents annual renewal process, or (y) cancellation or non-renewal of
any material Parent Insurance Policy, other than in connection with ordinary
renewals.

 



-77- 6.15 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions set forth

respective Subsidiaries shall be Solvent. No transfer of property is being
made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud

course of business, taking into account the timing of and amounts of cash to
be received by it and the timing of and amounts of cash to be payable on or
in respect of its indebtedness, in each case, after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of the definition of
" _Solvent_ " (i) "debt" means liability on a "claim" and (ii) "claim" means

liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,

a breach in performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment,
whether or not such equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, liquidated,
unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,

the amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets of such Person
(including goodwill) are sold as an entirety with reasonable promptness in an
arms length transaction under present conditions for the sale of comparable
business enterprises.

6.16  _Investment Representation_. Parent is acquiring the Units and the

Code Ann. §§ 48-103-201 to 209 (the " _Combination Act_ "), any Takeover Law,
nor any takeover-related provision in the Parent Charter or Parent Bylaws,
would (i) prohibit or restrict the ability of Parent to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or any related agreement or the Certificate
of Mergers or its ability to consummate the Purchase or the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) have the effect of

Partnership as identified on its website as of the date hereof, on the other
hand, that relate in any way to the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries or
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

6.20 _Information Supplied_. Parent hereby represents and warrants that all of
the information (other than the written information expressly provided by the
Partnership for inclusion therein) included or incorporated by reference in
the Registration Statement and the Prospectus Supplement shall not at the time

affected DandO Indemnitee and Unitholder Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed
that the DandO Indemnitees and Unitholder Indemnitees to whom this _Section

either the Partnership (prior to the Closing) or the Unitholders
Representative (at and after the Closing), respectively (which approval will
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless and only to the
extent, in the judgment of such party upon the advice of its outside counsel,
disclosure is required by applicable Law (including the periodic reporting

7.10 _Employment and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Parent covenants and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, for a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date,
provide to each Continuing Employee (i) annual base salary or base wages, and
cash target incentive compensation opportunities (for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding equity incentives), in each case, that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than such annual base salary or base wages, and cash target
incentive compensation opportunities (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding
equity incentives) provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to
the Closing Date, (ii) severance compensation benefits to any Continuing
Employees during the one (1) year period following the Closing Date at levels
at least equivalent to the levels of such severance compensation benefits as
in effect under the Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing and (iii)
other employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing under
any Benefit Plan. Employees of the Partnership or the Partnerships
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing who continue their employment
with the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date

entitlement to benefits, including the level or amount of vacation and
severance compensation benefits under the benefit and compensation plans,
programs, agreements and arrangements of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are
eligible to participate following the Closing (the " _Parent Plans_ "), Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the
Partnership, the Partnerships Subsidiaries and any predecessor entities, to
the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to
the Closing to credit for such service under any similar Benefit Plan or if
no such Benefit Plan was in effect, to the extent permitted under the
applicable Parent Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such service shall be
credited to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service. In addition, Parent, the Surviving
Partnership or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall use commercially
reasonable

 



-94-  efforts to cause, as of any date that any employee benefits are no longer
provided to a Continuing Employee under a Benefit Plan (i) such Continuing
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in the comparable Parent Plan, (ii) for purposes of each such Parent Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-
work requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such conditions were
inapplicable or waived under the comparable Benefit Plans in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to such date, and (iii)
for the plan year in which such date occurs, the crediting of each Continuing
Employee with any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid
prior to such date in satisfying any applicable co-payments, deductibles or
out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent Plan.

single integrated transaction, from qualifying as a reorganization under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code, (iii) following the Merger 3
Effective Time, and consistent with any such consent, neither the Parent nor
any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of its Affiliates, shall knowingly take any
action or cause any action to be taken which would cause Merger 2 and Merger
3, taken together as a single integrated transaction, to fail to so qualify as
a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code and (iv) each of Parent and
the Partnership shall timely satisfy or cause to be satisfied the reporting
requirements contained in Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6).

ARTICLE XI

MISCELLANEOUS

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the
parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific
terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal
remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such failure to perform or
breach. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by Seller and/or the
Partnership, on the one hand, or the Parent Parties, on the other hand, of any
of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the
Parent Parties, on the one hand, and Seller and/or the Partnership, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as
applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other (as applicable)
under this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or inadequacy of legal
remedy and without bond or other security being required, and this right
shall include the right of Seller and the Partnership to cause the Parent
Parties to use their reasonable best efforts to enforce the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter, including, if necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby on a timely basis, by requiring the Parent Parties to file
one or more lawsuits against the Debt Financing Sources to enforce the Debt
Financing Sources obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter. The
pursuit of specific enforcement or other equitable remedies by any party
hereto will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to
pursue any other right or remedy (whether at law or in equity) to which such
party may be entitled at any time.

(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise at any time of any other remedy.

 

(c) Each of Seller and the Partnership, on the one hand, and the Parent
Parties, on the other hand, hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the
availability of the equitable

 



-113-  remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement by Seller or the Partnership or the Parent Parties,
as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Partnership or the
Parent Parties, as applicable, under this Agreement. The parties hereto
further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section
11.1_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek at any time
any other form of relief that may be available to a party under
this Agreement (including monetary damages) in the event that this Agreement
has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this
_Section 11.1_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii)
nothing set forth in this _Section 11.1_ shall require any party hereto to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 11.1_ prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under _Article IX_ (and
pursuing monetary damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement
of any legal proceeding pursuant to this _Section 11.1_ or anything set forth
in this  _Section 11.1_ restrict or limit any partys right to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article IX_ or pursue any
other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 

11.2 _Payment of Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer, intangible,

this Agreement shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation.

 

11.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
Partnership, Seller, Sunbeam Primary and the Parent Parties shall bear its
own expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument contemplated by
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby.

11.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits hereto, the Partnership Disclosure Schedule and the Parent
Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality Agreements represent the entire
understanding and agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended, supplemented or
changed by a written instrument signed by each of the parties hereto;
_provided_ , that this proviso of this sentence in this _Section 11.4_,
_Section 11.5(a)_ (only to the extent such provision is incorporated in 
_Section 11.5(b)_ by reference), _Section 11.5(b)_, _Section 11.6_,
_Section 11.9(a)(viii)_ and _Section 11.10_ may not be modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that is adverse in any respect to the Debt Financing
Sources without the prior written consent of the Lead Debt Financing Sources.
Each provision in this Agreement may only be waived by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against
whom enforcement of any such provision so waived is sought. No action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any
party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action
of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing
waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No
failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right, power or remedy hereunder shall

 



-114-  operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

11.5 _Governing Law_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract,
tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of
the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) submits, for itself and its
property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or,
only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in the State of Delaware), and any appellate court from any thereof, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement), or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment, and agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such Delaware
Court of Chancery (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any Federal court of the United
States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), (b) waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of
action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty
made in or in connection with this Agreement) in the Delaware Court of
Chancery (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any Federal court of the United States
of America sitting in the State of Delaware) or any appellate court from any
thereof, (c) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court and (d) agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to it at the applicable address set forth in
_Section 11.7_ below shall be effective service of process for any suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court.

 

(b) Each of the parties agrees that it will not bring or support, nor permit
any of its Affiliates to bring or support, any suit, action or legal
proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way
to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if
under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal

 



-115-  courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (and appellate courts thereof), and makes the agreements, waivers and
consents set forth in  _Section 11.5(a)_ _mutatis mutandis_ but with respect
to the courts specified in this _Section 11.5(b)_. The parties hereto further
agree that all of the provisions of _Section 11.6_ relating to waiver of
jury trial shall apply to any suit, action or other proceeding referenced in
this _Section 11.5(b)_.

11.6 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE DEBT COMMITMENT
LETTER OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING THE DEBT
FINANCING) OR THE ACTIONS OF THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION,
PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR
HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE.
THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED FOR
AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY AND THAT ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
COMMITMENT LETTERS OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY SHALL
INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING
WITHOUT A JURY.

shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when delivered personally
by hand (with written confirmation of receipt, by other than automatic means,
whether electronic or otherwise), (b) when sent by facsimile or e-mail (with
written confirmation of transmission) or (c) one (1) Business Day following

11.8 _Severability_. If any condition, term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other conditions, terms or provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the provisions of
_Article IX_ and _Article X_ , including the remedies (and limitations
thereon) and the limitations on representations, warranties and covenants, be
construed as integral provisions of this Agreement and that such provisions,
remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that diminishes
a partys rights hereunder or increases a partys liability or obligations
hereunder.

 

11.9 _Binding Effect; Assignment_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in
this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Person not a party to this Agreement except (i) prior to the
Merger 2 Effective Time, for the right of Seller and the Unitholders to
pursue claims for damages (including damages based on loss of the economic
benefits of the transaction to Seller and the Unitholders) and other relief
(including equitable relief) for any breach of this Agreement by any of the
Parent Parties, whether or not this Agreement has been validly terminated
pursuant to _Article IX_ , which right is hereby expressly acknowledged and
agreed by each of the Parent Parties, (ii) _Section 7.7_ shall be for the
benefit of, and enforceable by, the DandO Indemnitees and the Unitholder
Indemnitees, (iii) _Sections 7.8_ , _7.19_ and _11.3_ shall be for the
benefit of, and enforceable by, the Unitholders, Seller and the Unitholders
Representative on behalf of each of the Unitholders and Seller, as
applicable, (iv) _Section 7.12(a)_ shall be for the benefit of, and
enforceable by, the Partnership, the Partnerships Subsidiaries and its and
their respective partners, members, directors, managers, officers, employees,
accountants, legal counsel and other Representatives, (v) _Section 11.10_
shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the Nonparty Affiliates of
the parties, (vi) _Section 11.11_ shall be for the benefit of, and
enforceable by, Seller, the Unitholders and STB, (vii) from and after the
Merger 1 Effective Time, the rights of the Unitholders (other than the General
Partner) and Seller to receive, as applicable, the Purchase Price, the Merger
1 Consideration, the Merger 2 Consideration and the Additional Transaction
Consideration (if any), in each case as set forth in _Article III_ , shall be
for the benefit of, and enforceable by, Seller and the Unitholders (other
than

 



-118-  the General Partner), (viii) _Sections 11.4_ , _11.5(a)_ (only to the
extent such provision is incorporated in _Section 11.5(b)_ by reference),
_11.5(b)_ ,  _11.6_ , _11.9(a)(viii)_ and _11.10_ shall be for the benefit
of, and enforceable by, the Debt Financing Sources, (ix) _Sections 3.2_ ,
_3.7_ , _3.9_ , _3.10_ , _3.11_ , _3.12_ and _3.13_ shall be for the benefit
of, and enforceable by, the Unitholders Representative on behalf of itself
and each of the Unitholders and Seller, as applicable and (x) _Section 7.22_
shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the Unitholder Indemnitees.
The rights granted pursuant to clause (i) of this _Section 11.9(a)_ shall
only be enforceable on behalf of Seller and the Unitholders by the Partnership
in its sole and absolute discretion, as agent for Seller and the Unitholders,
it being understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims shall
attach such Membership Interests and such Units, as applicable, and
subsequently transfer therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements or
other amounts recovered or received by the Partnership with respect to such
claims (net of expenses incurred by the Partnership in connection therewith)
may, in the Partnerships sole and absolute discretion, be (A) distributed, in
whole or in part, by the Partnership to Seller and the Unitholders as of any
date determined by the Partnership and/or (B) retained by the Partnership for
the use and benefit of the Partnership on behalf of Seller and the Unitholders
as the Partnership deems fit.

(b) No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder
may be made, directly or indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), by
(i) the Partnership, the General Partner or Seller, without the prior written
consent of Parent or (ii) any of the Parent Parties, without the prior written
consent of either the Partnership and Seller (prior to the Closing) or the
Unitholders Representative (at and after the Closing), respectively, except
that at and after the Merger 2 Effective Time, the Parent Parties may
collaterally assign their rights hereunder to any commercial lender or other
debt financing source of the Parent Parties without the Partnerships consent.
Any attempted assignment without obtaining such required consent shall be null
and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Parties may assign
this Agreement (in whole but not in part) to one or more wholly owned
Subsidiaries of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall
relieve the Parent Parties of their respective obligations under this
Agreement; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that in no event shall the Parent
Parties be permitted to assign this Agreement to any Person to the extent such
that, as a result of such assignment, either (x) any additional consent or
approval of, or filing, declaration or registration with, any Governmental
Authority would be required under this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or (y) any delay would occur with respect to
any consent or approval of, or filing, declaration or registration with, any
Governmental Authority that otherwise is required to be made under this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

11.10 _Non-Recourse_. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreements, all claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes
of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and such representations and
warranties are those solely of) the Persons that are expressly identified as
parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the " _Contracting Parties_ "). No
Person who is not a Contracting Party, including any current, former or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager,
stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative or

 



-119-  assignee of, and any financial advisor, Debt Financing Source or lender to,
any Contracting Party, or any current, former or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor,
Debt Financing Source or lender to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of
action, obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with,
or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach
(other than as set forth in the Confidentiality Agreements), and, to the
maximum extent permitted by Law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and
releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations
against any such Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the
maximum extent permitted by Law, except to the extent otherwise set forth in
the Confidentiality Agreements, (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and
releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may
otherwise be available at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or
disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose
liability of a Contracting Party on any Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by
statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality,
alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil,
unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise; and (b) each Contracting Party
disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the
performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement.

11.11 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. It is acknowledged by each
of the parties that each of Seller, the Partnership and certain affiliates of
Hellman and Friedman LLC who are Unitholders have retained Simpson Thacher and
Bartlett LLP (" _STB_ ") to act as its counsel in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and that STB has not acted as counsel
for any other party in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and that none of the other parties has the status of a client of STB for
conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof. Each of the
Parent Parties, Seller, the Partnership and Sunbeam Primary hereby agrees
that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between the Parent
Parties, the General Partner, the Surviving Corporation, Sunbeam Primary or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Unitholders
and/or Seller, on the other hand, STB may represent any or all of the
Unitholders and/or Seller in such dispute even though the interests of the
Unitholders and/or Seller may be directly adverse to the Parent Parties, the
General Partner, the Surviving Corporation, Sunbeam Primary or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, and even though STB formerly may have represented the
General Partner, the Partnership, Sunbeam Primary and/or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not apply if STB, at the
time of such dispute, is handling ongoing matters for the Parent Parties, the
General Partner, the Surviving Corporation, Sunbeam Primary and/or any of
their respective Subsidiaries. Each of the General Partner, the Partnership
(on behalf of itself and the Surviving Corporation), Sunbeam Primary, and the
Parent Parties acknowledges and agrees that, in connection with any future
dispute between the Parent Parties, the General Partner, the Surviving
Corporation, Sunbeam Primary and/or any of their respective Affiliates, on
the one hand, and any of the Unitholders, Seller and/or their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, as to all communications among STB, Seller, the General
Partner, the Partnership, Sunbeam Primary any of the Partnerships
Subsidiaries and/or

 



-120-  any Unitholder that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to the applicable Unitholder and/or Seller, as the case
may be, and may be controlled by such Unitholder and/or Seller, as the case
may be, and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Parent Parties, the General
Partner, the Surviving Corporation, Sunbeam Primary or any of their
respective Affiliates.

11.12 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent agrees to cause Merger Sub, Merger Sub II,
the General Partner (solely following the Closing), Sunbeam Primary (solely
following Merger 2) and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform
all of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this
Agreement on a timely basis. Parent unconditionally guarantees to the
Partnership the full and complete performance by each of Merger Sub, Merger
Sub II, the General Partner (solely following the Closing), Sunbeam Primary
(solely following Merger 2) and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, of
its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall be liable for any
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Merger Sub,
Merger Sub II, the General Partner (solely following the Closing),
Sunbeam Primary (solely following Merger 2) or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, under this Agreement. Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment,
demand of performance, filing of any claim, any right to require any
proceeding first against Merger Sub, Merger Sub II, the General Partner
(solely following the Closing), Sunbeam Primary (solely following Merger 2)
and/or the Surviving Corporation, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever
in connection with the performance of its obligations set forth in this
_Section 11.12_ or elsewhere in this Agreement.

11.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including by means of facsimile or e-mail in .pdf format), each
of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of
which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the
same agreement.
