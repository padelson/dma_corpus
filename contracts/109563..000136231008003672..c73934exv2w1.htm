3.2 _Terms of Payment_. One Hundred Sixty-Nine Million Dollars
(US$169,000,000) shall be payable on the Closing Date, in immediately
available United States Dollars by wire transfer to a bank account or
accounts designated by Sellers, subject to adjustment as provided in Section

paid the payroll obligations referred to in Item 1 of _Schedule 2.1_, Buyer
shall remit the amounts so paid to Parent via check mailed to the address set
forth in Section 17 hereof. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

3.3 _Adjustment of Purchase Price_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted and
Parent shall pay to Buyer on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the extent the
Buyer is unable to collect the value of Accounts Receivable (net of any
reserves therefor on Parents consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2008
or any additional reserves accrued up to the Closing Date in accordance
with Parents general policy for accounts receivable reserves and in a manner
consistent with prior practice (or as otherwise disclosed on _Schedule
3.3_)) within 180 days after the Closing Date. On the 181st day following the
Closing Date, Buyer agrees to transfer any uncollected Accounts Receivable to
Parent, and Parent agrees to pay to Buyer the full amount of any
uncollected Accounts Receivable (net of any reserves therefor on Parents
consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2008 or any additional reserves
accrued up to the Closing Date in accordance with Parents general policy for
accounts receivable reserves and in a manner consistent with prior practice
(or as otherwise disclosed on _Schedule 3.3_)) in immediately available
United States Dollars by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Buyer.
In calculating the aggregate amount of uncollected Accounts Receivable, the
following protocol shall apply: (i) payments referencing an invoice shall be
credited against such invoice, (ii) payments that do not reference, but that
are in the exact amount of an invoice (or the undisputed portion of an
invoice) shall be credited to such invoice, and (iii) all other payments
shall be credited to the oldest undisputed invoice. Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to collect all Account
Receivables. Uncollected Accounts Receivable and reserves therefor shall be
determined based upon the aggregate amounts thereof that would be included on
Parents consolidated balance sheet as of the Closing Date, rather than on a
Seller-by-Seller basis. Buyer shall preserve and shall make available
to Sellers (in the event of any claim for payment by Buyer under this Section
3.3) all books and records relating to the Accounts Receivable and any
reserves therefor. 

  

3.4. _Allocation_. The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Transferred
Assets, the covenants not to compete and the other identified intangibles in
the manner indicated on  _Schedule 3.4_ (which Schedule may be prepared
following the execution of this Agreement). Buyer will, on or before the 60th
day after the Closing Date, deliver to Sellers its draft of Schedule 3.4.
Sellers and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to agree on Schedule 3.4 and
shall attempt to resolve any disagreements within 15 days after Sellers
receipt of the proposed Schedule 3.4. Following agreement on _Schedule 3.4_,
Sellers and Buyer covenant and agree not to take a position on any income tax
return, before any governmental agency charged with the collection of any
income tax or in any judicial proceeding that is in any way inconsistent
with the terms of this Section 3.4. On or before the 90th day after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall send to each Seller copies of Internal Revenue
Service Form 8594 containing Buyers allocation, under Section 1060 of the
Code, of the Purchase Price among the Transferred Assets. Such Forms 8594
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with _Schedule 3.4_. Buyer
and Sellers shall prepare all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
allocations set forth on such Forms 8594.

instruments for which provision is made herein will constitute valid and
binding obligations of each Seller, enforceable against it in accordance with
their respective terms. 

  

4.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Assuming the expiration or
early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the performance by Sellers
of their obligations under this Agreement will: (a) result in a violation of
applicable statute, ordinance, rule, or regulation, order, judgment, writ or
decree of any court or governmental or regulatory body applicable to any
Seller, or by which any of the Transferred Assets may be bound; (b) conflict
with any of Sellers charter documents; or (c) result in the breach of, or
constitute a default under, any agreement or instrument listed on _Schedule
4.3_ to which any Seller is a party, or by which any Seller or any of the
Transferred Assets is bound. Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.3_, no
action, approval, consent or authorization by any governmental agency,

order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to
assign any material Transferred Contract to Buyer.

principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis (between periods and from
period to period) and present fairly the financial position of the Sellers as

or services sold by Sellers infringe on the proprietary rights of others.

indemnification for, infringement of any other partys intellectual property
rights. 

   

(b) The Intellectual Property has been sufficient for the conduct of the
Business by Sellers. Sellers have title and ownership interests in the
Intellectual Property (other than trade secrets) free and clear of all
encumbrances. There are no restrictions or limitations on Sellers right to
use and transfer any Intellectual Property to Buyer as contemplated by this
Agreement, and all of Sellers rights in and to the Intellectual Property
will be conveyed to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(c) Sellers have not licensed any third party to use any Intellectual Property
and have not entered into any contract or arrangement pursuant to which any

otherwise violating the rights of the Intellectual Property.

directly or indirectly, guaranteed indebtedness, liabilities or obligations
of Sellers;

(l) any agreement, contract or other instrument entered into with any third
party under which the Business has, directly or indirectly, made any advance,

Except as disclosed on _Schedule 4.11_, each Material Contract is in full

respects performed and are performing all obligations required to be
performed under the Material Contracts, and neither Sellers nor to the best
of Sellers knowledge any other party thereto is in default under any of the
Material Contracts. Sellers have not received any notice of default under any
Material Contract, nor has any event occurred that with notice or lapse of
time or both would constitute a default by Sellers thereunder. To the
knowledge of Sellers, no Material Contract is subject to any impending
cancellation or breach. Sellers are not bound by any commitments for the
performance of services or delivery of products in excess of their ability
to provide such services or deliver such products during the time available
to satisfy such commitments. All outstanding commitments for the performance
of services or delivery of products were made on a basis calculated to
produce a profit under the circumstances prevailing when such commitments
were made.

sheets as of May 31, 2008. Transferred Inventory that has been owned by any
Seller for in excess of 24 months has been acquired and has been maintained
by such Seller in the ordinary course of Business. Schedule _4.12_ identifies
all of the locations of the Transferred Inventory, including without
limitation, locations used by Sellers, Sellers customers or suppliers, or
otherwise, together with Sellers cost of such Transferred Inventory. Except
as otherwise described on  _Schedule 4.12_, none of the Transferred
Inventory in Sellers possession is held on consignment, and none of
the Transferred Inventory is consigned to third parties. Sellers are not
under any liability or obligation with respect to the repurchase or return of

Inventory complies with all applicable laws, standards and regulations. The
Transferred Inventory complies with all material specifications agreed to
between the Business and its customers.

regarding the existence of any such violation.

attached contains a listing of the top 10 customers and suppliers of each

transactions contemplated hereby, its relationship with Sellers. To the best
of Sellers knowledge, no customer or supplier listed in _Schedule 4.16_

    ##### 

  

   

Each Pension Plan listed on Schedule 4.18 that is intended to qualify under
Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined to be so qualified by the
Internal Revenue Service, the trust maintained thereunder has been determined
to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and nothing has
occurred since the date of such determinations that is likely to cause the
loss of such qualification or exemption. No charge, complaint, action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation, claim or demand with respect to a Plan or
to the administration or the investment of the assets of any Plan that the
Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate maintains or has maintained, or to which the
Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate contributes or has contributed, for the
benefit of any current or former employee (other than routine claims for
benefits) is pending or threatened that could reasonably be expected to
result in a material liability to the Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate or to
such Plan or a fiduciary of such Plan. All contributions (including all
employer contributions and employee contributions) that have been required to
have been paid with respect to each Plan have been paid within the time
required by such Plan or applicable laws. Except as required by the Code or
this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not accelerate the time of vesting or the time of payment, or
increase the amount, of compensation due to any director, employee, officer,
former employee or former officer of the Sellers or an ERISA Affiliate. No
written or oral representations have been made to any employee or former
employee of the Sellers or any ERISA Affiliate at any time promising or
guaranteeing any employer payment or funding for the continuation of medical,
dental, life or disability coverage for any period of time beyond the end of
the current plan year (except to the extent of coverage required under
COBRA). Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.18_, neither the Sellers nor any

Pension Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, a multiemployer plan as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA, a multiple employer plan within the meaning of
Section 210 of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code, or a voluntary
employees beneficiary association, as defined in Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code. No Pension Plan, Welfare Plan, or Benefit Arrangement will result in
any liability to the Buyer or will have an adverse impact upon the
Transferred Assets or subject the Transferred Assets to any lien under ERISA,
the Code, or the laws of any state. Each Plan listed on Schedule 4.18 that is
a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, as defined in Section 409A(d)(1)
of the Code, has been operated in compliance with the provisions of said
Section 409A and has been amended to the extent necessary to be compliant
with such Section 409A. As used herein, the term "ERISA Affiliate" shall mean

knowledge of actual or threatened violation of any law relating to employment
practices or employment relations. 

 

    #####

or commitment with respect to any written or oral employment, compensation,
deferred compensation, consulting, severance pay or similar agreement,
express or implied, other than the agreements listed on _Schedule 4.11_ or
_Schedule 4.18_.  _Schedule 4.19_ sets forth a payroll list as of May 31,

_Schedule 4.22_ shall be referred to herein as the "Leased Real Property."
Sellers have a good and valid leasehold as to the Leased Real Property, free
and clear of all mortgages, security interests, title defects, pledges, liens
and the possibility of liens, charges, tenancies, restrictions
and encumbrances, other than taxes and assessments, both general and special,
which are a lien but not yet due and payable that do not, individually or in
the aggregate, materially detract from the value of the Leased Real Property
or materially impair the use and operation thereof in carrying on the
Business. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.22_, each lease for Leased
Real Property (the "Leases") is in full force and effect and has not been
amended or modified. All terms, conditions, and provisions required to be
performed by Sellers under the Lease have been duly and timely performed and
complied with. There is no default on the part of the landlord and, to the
best of Sellers knowledge, no event has occurred or failed to occur which
with the giving of notice, the passage of time, or both, would constitute a
default by the landlord or Sellers under the Lease. The landlord has
not waived, or extended the time for the performance of, any obligation of
Sellers under the Lease. Except as disclosed on _Schedule 4.22_, there are
no security deposits or prepaid rent (including last months rent in advance)
with respect to the Lease.

equivalents, accrued liabilities and accounts payable ("Net Tangible
Assets"). 

  

4.25 _Accounts Receivable_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.25_, all of
the Business trade and other accounts receivable and all notes, bonds and
other evidences of the right to receive fees or other payments arising from
transactions occurring in the Sellers conduct of the Business (collectively,
"Accounts Receivable") represent valid and binding obligations of
the respective debtors enforceable in accordance with their terms, arise from
sales actually made or services actually performed in the ordinary course of
business and are collectible in the ordinary course of business consistent

applicable reserve reflected in the Financial Statements. Since May 31, 2008,

regular collection practices and has not given or granted any rebates,
discounts, advances or allowances to any customers not in the ordinary course
of business and has not otherwise sold, discounted or disposed of any

will give, or cause to be given, to Buyer and its representatives, such
reasonable access to the personnel, properties, titles, contracts, books,

Buyer to obtain information in connection with the preparation, and any
audit, of Buyers tax returns and any tax related claims, demands, other
audits, suits, actions or proceedings by or against Buyer as the owner and/or
operator of the Business. Sellers and Buyer agree to act in good faith
with respect to payments received from customers after the Closing Date.
Sellers and Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to
deliver payments to the appropriate party for processing, including efforts
to review outstanding invoices and payment amounts to determine
the appropriate party for payment. In addition, Sellers will, from time

transfer to and to vest in Buyer all right, title, and interest of Sellers in

of Buyer in and to all of the Transferred Assets. Sellers obligations under

(including W-2s), sales, use, gross receipts and property taxes, and
Forms 1099. Buyer will also reasonably assist Seller with any federal, state

by Seller to assemble such information into tax packages in a manner
consistent with the services previously provided to Seller by such employees.

copying such records pertaining to the Business as may reasonably be
requested by Sellers in connection with their rights or obligations as the
former owners of the Transferred Assets. Buyers obligations under this

purposes of the benefit plans and vacation and sick leave policies of Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Employee on sick leave, short-term
disability, long term disability leave, or any other leave of absence except
a military leave of absence shall only be offered employment by Buyer when he
or she is physically able to return to work, provided however that Buyer shall

11\. _COVENANTS NOT-TO-COMPETE; CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION_. 

  

11.1 In order for Buyer to have the full benefit of its purchase, during the
five-year period following the Closing Date (except as set forth below), none
of The Hillman Company, the Sellers and the Retained Businesses, nor any of
their respective affiliates will compete with Buyer, directly or indirectly,
whether as a shareholder, partner, member, agent, or consultant, or in
any other capacity, (i) enter into or engage, directly or indirectly, in any

including the provision, sale, design or distribution of products or services

limited partnership or equivalent interest in any private equity funds in
which The Hillman Company or any of its affiliates may invest as a limited

fund or any portfolio company to compete) or (iv) directly or indirectly,
hire, induce, attempt to influence, solicit for employment, encourage to

case Seller shall not employ such person for a period of one year from the
later of the Closing Date or the date the person discontinues employment
with Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , the restrictions of this clause (iv)
shall not apply to any Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated by
Buyer without cause. The restrictions of this Section 11.1 apply in the
United States. The Restrictions set forth in this Section 11.1(i), (ii) and
(iii) shall not apply to the Retained Businesses in the territory set forth
on Schedule 11.1 (the "Territory") and shall apply to the Retained Businesses
during the three-year period following the Closing Date and not thereafter. 

  

11.2 For the five-year period following the Closing Date, Sellers and Buyer
agree to keep confidential and not to disclose to others information relating
to the Business and, in the case of Buyer, to the business of the Retained

is required to be disclosed by applicable law or by court or governmental
order. 

  

11.3 The Hillman Company, Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that a breach of any
of their obligations under this Article 11 would result in irreparable injury
to the other party for which damages would not be an adequate remedy.
Therefore, Sellers and Buyer consent to the issuance of injunctive relief in
the event of a breach of its or their obligations under this Article 11,
in addition to any other remedies to which they may be entitled by law or
equity. Any Proceeding brought to enforce a provision of this Article 11 must

11.4 Any provision of the foregoing covenant that is prohibited or
unenforceable, including without limitation, as to time, geographic area, or
scope of activity, shall be void to the extent of that prohibition or
unenforceability only and the remaining provisions, including the
remainder of any provision found only partially invalid or unenforceable,
shall continue to be in full force and effect and shall not be affected by
such invalidity or unenforceability. Buyer agrees that if any provision of
the foregoing is too broad, any reviewing court can "blue pencil" the
provision and enforce it to the maximum extent possible. 

  

11.5 The Hillman Company and Sellers acknowledge that their covenants not-to-
compete are a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Hillman Company and
Sellers further acknowledge that the restrictions and scope of this Article
11 are reasonable and necessary to protect the Buyers legitimate interest
in the Business. The Buyer acknowledges that its covenants in Section 11.2
are a material inducement to Sellers to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Buyer further
acknowledges that the restrictions and scope of Section 11.2 are reasonable
and necessary to protect the Parents legitimate interest in the business of
the Retained Businesses. 

  

12. _INVESTIGATION_. Notwithstanding any investigation or inquiry made by or on behalf of Buyer or Sellers, each party shall be entitled to rely on the representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein or given on the Closing Date. The representations, warranties, and covenants that are contained in this Agreement or given on the Closing Date will survive any investigation and inquiry made by or on behalf of Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be. 

   

13\. _INDEMNIFICATION_. 

  

13.1 _By Sellers_. Sellers agree, jointly and severally, to hold harmless,
indemnify and defend Buyer and its legal representatives, successors and

attorneys fees) ("Damages") incurred by Buyer by reason of (a) breach of any
of the representations or warranties set forth in Article 4, (b) the breach

prior to the Closing.

and its legal representatives, successors and assigns from and against any
Damages incurred by Sellers by reason of (a) breach of any of the

    ##### 

  

  

13.3 _Survival_. Each of the Representations and Warranties made by the
parties to this Agreement shall survive for a period of eighteen months (18)
after the Closing Date, except that the representations and warranties (i) in

and 4.9 (Title to and Sufficiency of Assets) shall survive without
limitation and (ii) Section 4.8 (Tax Matters), 4.15 (Environmental and Safety
Matters), 4.18 (Employee Benefits) and 4.19 (Labor Matters) shall survive for
91 days following the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations
(each a "Survival Period"). After the Survival Period, no claim for
indemnification based on such representations or warranties may be asserted,
unless a Claim Notice has been delivered within the applicable Survival
Period. Claims first asserted in writing with reasonable detail before the
expiration of the Survival Period may be pursued until they are finally
resolved. A Claim for indemnification or reimbursement not based upon any
representation or warranty or any covenant or obligation to be performed and
complied with prior to the Closing Date may be made at any time. No Claim for
indemnification may be asserted by Buyer or Sellers under Section 13.1(b)
(other than with respect to Article 11), (c), (d), (e) or (f) or
Section 13.2(a), (b) (other than with respect to Article 11), (c) or (d)
unless such Claim for indemnification is first asserted within five years of
the Closing Date. 

  

13.4 _Limitations_. The indemnification obligations of Buyer and Sellers are
subject to the following limitations and qualifications: 

   

(a) Buyer shall not be entitled to make a Claim to recover Damages under
Section 13.1(a) unless and until it has incurred Damages in the aggregate in
excess of $500,000 (the "Basket Amount") in which event Buyer shall be
entitled to make a claim under Section 13.1(a) for all Damages incurred by
it. Sellers shall not be entitled to make a Claim to recover Damages under
Section 13.2(a) unless and until it has incurred Damage in the aggregate in
excess of the Basket Amount. 

   

(b) In no case shall Buyer, on the one hand, or Sellers, on the other, be
liable to the other party under Section 13.1(a) or 13.2(a) as the case may be
in excess of 15% of the Purchase Price. 

   

(c) The limitations of this Section 13.4 will not apply to (i) fraud or
intentional misrepresentation by Parent or Sellers with respect to of any of
Sellers representations and warranties under this Agreement or to any
intentional breach by Sellers of any covenant or obligation hereunder or (ii)
failure by Buyer to pay the Purchase Price as and when due. 

   

13.5 _Indemnification Procedure_. 

   

(a) Upon the occurrence of any event that a party asserts to be the basis for
a claim for indemnification against the other party (the "Indemnifying
Party") under this Section (a "Claim"), then the party to be indemnified (the
"Indemnified Party") shall promptly give notice (a "Claim Notice") to the
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing, provided, however, that no delay on
the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation under this Agreement
except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(b) If the Claim involves the claim of any third party, the Indemnifying Party
will be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it
wishes (unless the Indemnifying Party is also a party to such Proceeding and
the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation
would be inappropriate) to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the
defense of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party will not, as long as
it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under
this Section 13 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with
respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding,
other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) no compromise or settlement of such
claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified
Partys consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation
of law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on
any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party, and (B) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
Indemnifying Party; and (ii) the Indemnified Party will have no liability
with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without
its consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the commencement
of any Proceeding and the Indemnifying Party does not, within ten (10)
business days after the Indemnified Partys notice is given, give notice to
the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of
such Proceeding, subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to assume the
defense of such Proceedings at a later date, the Indemnified Party may, by
notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to defend,
compromise, or settle such Proceeding, and the Indemnifying Party will be
bound by any determination of a Proceeding so defended or any compromise or
settlement effected. 

   

(c) If the Indemnified Party provides a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party
that does not involve a third-party claim, the Indemnifying Party may, within
thirty (30) days after receipt of such Claim Notice, notify the Indemnified
Party that the Indemnifying Party disputes the Claim for indemnification set
forth in such Claim Notice (a "Dispute Notice"). If, with respect to the
claim for indemnification set forth in a Claim Notice, no Dispute Notice is
given to the Indemnified Party within such thirty (30) day period, the Claim
shall be deemed valid, and the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to pay

purchase from Sellers the Transferred Assets (as such term is defined in the
Purchase Agreement) to be acquired upon the terms and conditions set forth in
the Purchase Agreement. 

  

B. Guarantor is the indirect owner of all of the outstanding equity interests
of Parent and each Seller and having a financial interest in Sellers has
agreed to provide this guaranty to Buyer for the benefit of Sellers. 

  

C. As a condition precedent to Buyers performance of its obligations under
the Purchase Agreement and in consideration therefor, Buyer has required the
execution and delivery of this Guaranty by Guarantor. 

  

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which hereby are acknowledged, Guarantor hereby agrees as
follows: 

  

1. _Guaranty of Payment_. Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guaranties to Buyer the punctual payment and performance when due, whether at stated maturity or by acceleration or otherwise, of the obligations, covenants and agreements of Sellers to Buyer set forth in Section 3.3 and Section 13.1 of the Purchase Agreement (such obligations, covenants and agreements are hereinafter referred to collectively as " _Payment Obligations_ "). This Guaranty is a present and continuing guaranty of payment and not of collectibility, and Buyer shall not be required to prosecute collection, enforcement or other remedies against any Seller or any other guarantor of the Payment Obligations, or to enforce or resort to any collateral for the repayment of the Payment Obligations or other rights or remedies pertaining thereto, before calling on Guarantor for payment. If for any reason Sellers shall fail or be unable to pay, punctually and fully, any of the Payment Obligations, Guarantor shall pay such obligations to Buyer in full immediately upon demand. One or more successive actions may be brought against Guarantor, as often as Buyer deems advisable, until all of the Payment Obligations are paid and performed in full. The Payment Obligations, together with all other payment and performance obligations of Guarantor hereunder are referred to herein as " _Sellers  Obligations_". 

 

    ##### 

  

  

2. _Representations and Warranties_. The following shall constitute representations and warranties of Guarantor and Guarantor hereby acknowledges that Buyer intends to enter into the Purchase Agreement in reliance thereon: 

   

a. Guarantor is duly organized, validly existing, in good standing and formed
under the laws of the State of Delaware and has full power and authority to
carry on its business as currently conducted and to enter into and perform
this Guaranty. Guarantor owns 100% of the outstanding membership interests of
FPH Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which in turn owns
100% of the voting equity interests of Parent. 

   

b. The execution, delivery, and performance of this Guaranty have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Guarantor.
Guarantor has full power, authority, and legal right to execute and deliver
this Guaranty and to perform its obligations hereunder. Upon execution and
delivery by Guarantor, this Agreement will constitute valid and binding
obligations of Guarantor, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms. 

   

c. Guarantor is not in default and no event has occurred that with the passage
of time and/or the giving of notice will constitute a default under any
agreement to which Guarantor is a party, the effect of which will impair
performance by Guarantor of its obligations under this Guaranty. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Guaranty nor compliance with the terms and
provisions hereof will violate any applicable law, rule,
regulation, judgment, decree or order, or will conflict with or result in any
breach of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of any
indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, instrument, document, agreement or
contract of any kind that creates, represents, evidences or provides for any
lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the property or assets of Guarantor,
or any other indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, instrument, document,
agreement or contract of any kind to which Guarantor is a party or to which
Guarantor or the property of Guarantor may be subject. 

   

d. There is not any litigation, arbitration, governmental or
administrative proceedings, actions, examinations, claims or demands pending,
or to Guarantors knowledge, threatened that could adversely affect
performance by Guarantor of its obligations under this Guaranty. 

   

e. Neither this Guaranty nor the financial statements of Guarantor, nor any
statement or certification as to facts previously furnished or required
herein to be furnished to Buyer by Guarantor, contains any material
inaccuracy or untruth in any representation, covenant or warranty or omits to
state a fact material to this Guaranty. 

  

3. _Minimum Net Worth_. Guarantor will not allow its consolidated net worth to be less than $50,000,000.00 at any time. Consolidated net worth as to Guarantor shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. Within 90 days after the expiration of each calendar year, beginning with 2008 and continuing through 2013, Guarantor shall provide to Buyer a letter from its auditor stating that it has audited the financial statements of Guarantor and that based upon such audit, the Guarantors consolidated net worth is in excess of $50,000,000 at the end of such calendar year. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

4. _Continuing Guaranty_. Guarantor agrees that performance of Sellers Obligations by Guarantor shall be a primary obligation, shall not be subject to any counterclaim, set-off, abatement, deferment or defense based upon any claim that Guarantor may have against Buyer, Sellers, any other guarantor of Sellers Obligations or any other person or entity, and shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, discharged or affected in any way by, any circumstance or condition (whether or not Guarantor shall have any knowledge thereof), including without limitation: 

   

a. any lack of validity or enforceability of the Purchase Agreement or any of
the documents entered into in conjunction therewith; 

   

b. any termination, amendment, modification or other change in the Purchase
Agreement or any of the documents executed in conjunction therewith; 

   

c. any failure, omission or delay on the part of Sellers, Guarantor, any
other guarantor of Sellers Obligations or Buyer to conform or comply with
any term of the Purchase Agreement, any documents executed in conjunction
therewith, or any failure of Buyer to give notice of any event of default; 

   

d. any waiver, compromise, release, settlement or extension of time of payment
or performance or observance of any of the obligations or agreements
contained in the Purchase Agreement or any documents executed in conjunction
therewith; 

   

e. any action or inaction by Buyer under or in respect to the Purchase
Agreement or any documents executed in conjunction therewith, any failure,
lack of diligence, omission or delay on the part of Buyer to perfect,
enforce, assert or exercise any lien, security interest, right, power or
remedy conferred on it in the Purchase Agreement or any documents executed in
conjunction therewith, or any other action or inaction on the part of Buyer; 

   

f. any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
arrangement, readjustment, assignment for the benefit of creditors,
composition, receivership, liquidation, marshalling of assets and liabilities
or similar events or proceedings with respect to Sellers, Guarantor or any
other guarantor of Sellers Obligations, as applicable, or any of their
respective property or creditors, or any action taken by any trustee
or receiver or by any court in any such proceeding; 

   

g. any merger or consolidation of any Seller into or with any entity, or any
sale, lease or transfer of any of the assets of Sellers, Guarantor or any
other guarantor of Sellers Obligations to any other person or entity; 

   

h. any change in the ownership of Sellers or any change in the relationship
between Sellers, Guarantor or any other guarantor of Sellers Obligations, or
any termination of any such relationship; 

 

    ##### 

  

   

i. any release or discharge by operation of law of Sellers, Guarantor or any
other guarantor of Sellers Obligations from any obligation or agreement
contained in the Purchase Agreement or any documents executed in conjunction
therewith (other than as a result of full performance hereunder or
thereunder); or 

   

j. any other occurrence, circumstance, happening or event, whether similar
or dissimilar to the foregoing and whether foreseen or unforeseen, which
otherwise might constitute a legal or equitable defense or discharge of the
liabilities of a guarantor or surety or which otherwise might limit recourse
against Sellers or Guarantor to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

  

5. _Waivers_. Guarantor expressly and unconditionally waives (i) notice of any of the matters referred to in Section 4 above, (ii) all notices which may be required by statute, rule of law or otherwise, now or hereafter in effect, to preserve intact any rights against Guarantor, including, without limitation, any demand, presentment and protest, proof of notice of non-payment under the Purchase Agreement or any documents executed in conjunction therewith and notice of any Event of Default or any failure on the part of Sellers, Guarantor or any other guarantor of Sellers Obligations to perform or comply with any covenant, agreement, term or condition of the Purchase Agreement or any documents executed in conjunction therewith, (iii) any right to the enforcement, assertion or exercise against Sellers, Guarantor or any other guarantor of Sellers Obligations of any right or remedy conferred under the Purchase Agreement or any documents executed in conjunction therewith, (iv) any requirement of diligence on the part of any person or entity, (v) any requirement to exhaust any remedies or to mitigate the damages resulting from any default under any of the Purchase Agreement or any documents executed in conjunction therewith, (vi) any notice of any sale, transfer or other disposition of any right, title or interest of Buyer under any of the Purchase Agreement or any documents executed in conjunction therewith, and (vii) any other defenses available to a surety under applicable law. 

  

Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 5 or any other provision of this
Guaranty, Buyer agrees that if Buyers liability in respect of any Payment
Obligation is covered by any insurance policy of Buyer, Buyer will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reimbursement or recovery for such
Payment Obligation from such insurance policy before making a claim against
Guarantor under this Guaranty; provided, however, Buyer shall not be required
to pursue reimbursement or recovery under any insurance policy to the extent
that Buyer is advised that submitting any such claim shall have a material
future impact on its experience rating, claims history, future premiums or
cost of insurance or availability of such coverage on comparable terms. 

  

6. _Subrogation Waiver_. Until Sellers Obligations are paid in full and all periods under applicable bankruptcy law for the contest of any payment by Guarantor or Sellers as a preferential or fraudulent payment have expired, Guarantor knowingly, and with advice of counsel, waives, relinquishes, releases and abandons all rights and claims to indemnification, contribution, reimbursement, subrogation and payment which Guarantor may now or hereafter have by and from Sellers and the successors and assigns of Sellers, for any payments made by Guarantor to Buyer, including, without limitation, any rights which might allow Sellers, Sellers successors, a creditor of Sellers, or a trustee in bankruptcy of Sellers to claim in bankruptcy or any other similar proceedings that any payment made by Sellers or Sellers successors and assigns to Buyer was on behalf of or for the benefit of Guarantor and that such payment is recoverable by Sellers, a creditor or trustee in bankruptcy of Sellers as a preferential payment, fraudulent conveyance, payment of an insider or any other classification of payment which may otherwise be recoverable from Buyer. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

7. _Reinstatement_. The obligations of Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or automatically be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment of any of Sellers Obligations or Guarantors obligations under this Guaranty is rescinded or otherwise must be restored or returned by Buyer upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of Guarantor or Sellers or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. 

  

8. _Successors and Assigns_. This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of Buyer and its successors and assigns. This Guaranty shall be binding on Guarantor and the successors and assigns of Guarantor. The Guarantors liability hereunder is independent of any other guarantees or other obligations at any time in effect with respect to Sellers Obligations or any part thereof and the Guarantors liability hereunder may be enforced regardless of the existence, validity, enforcement or non-enforcement of any such other guarantees or other obligations. 

  

9. _No Waiver of Rights_. No delay or failure on the part of Buyer to exercise any right, power or privilege under this Guaranty or the Purchaser Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right, or be deemed to establish a custom or course of dealing or performance between the parties hereto. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. No notice to or demand on Guarantor in any case shall entitle Guarantor to any other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. 

  

10. _Modification_. The terms of this Guaranty may be waived, discharged, or terminated only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought. No amendment, modification, waiver or other change of any of the terms of this Guaranty shall be effective without the prior written consent of Buyer. 

  

11. _Joinder_. Any action to enforce this Guaranty may be brought against Guarantor without any reimbursement or joinder of Sellers or any other guarantor of Sellers Obligations in such action. 

  

12. _Severability_. If any provision of this Guaranty is deemed to be invalid by reason of the operation of law, or by reason of the interpretation placed thereon by any administrative agency or any court, Guarantor and Buyer shall negotiate an equitable adjustment in the provisions of the same in order to effect, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the purpose of this Guaranty and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, or portions or applications thereof, shall not be affected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

13. _Applicable Law_. This Guaranty is governed as to validity, interpretation, effect and in all other respects by laws and decisions of the State of New York.

SCHEDULE 2.1 

   

ASSUMED LIABILITIES  

  

The following liabilities of Sellers (other than liabilities to affiliates)
shall be Assumed Liabilities of Buyer as of the Closing Date: 

  

    1.  |   |

Employee payroll liabilities for payroll periods prior to the Closing Date
where the regularly scheduled pay date occurs after the Closing Date. For
clarity, payroll liabilities shall include salary, wages and commissions and
related payroll taxes and shall specifically include the payroll liabilities
related to the employees of H.E.B. LLC dba Power Systems whose compensation
is contingent upon gross margin.

  
---|---|--- 
   

  

    2.  |   |

Liability for vacation days, sick days and personal days accrued for
Transferred Employees, up to 30 days, on a basis consistent with AIT
employment policies.

  
---|---|--- 
   

  

    3.  |   |

Accounts payable incurred in the ordinary course of business and within terms
for inventory, supplies and services.

  
---|---|--- 
   

  

    4.  |   |

Operating liabilities for goods and services incurred in the ordinary course
of business and within terms, except operating liabilities relating to any
assets of Sellers that are not Transferred Assets (such as insurance
premiums, benefit plan liabilities, and liabilities under Contracts that are
not Transferred Contracts).

  
---|---|--- 
   

  

    5.  |   |

Formula-based bonuses accrued on and after July 1, 2008 for Transferred
Employees who become employees of Buyer.

  
---|---|--- 
   

  

Notes: 

  

    A.  |   |

Under item 1 above, if a pay period closes June 29 but the Closing is June 30
and employees are paid on July 5 for the pay period that ended June 29, Buyer
would be obligated to pay Parent an amount equal to the July 5 payroll
assumed liability.

  
---|---|--- 
   

  

    B.  |   |

Bay routinely hires contract employees. If the work done in July is invoiced
in August (and the Closing date is July 31), the uninvoiced operating
liability will be payable by Buyer under item 4 above.

  
---|---|--- 
   

  

    C.  |   |

Sales tax returns and payment are completed on an accrual basis. When a sale
is generated an accrual is established to the state and the sales tax is on
the customer bill. The tax is normally paid on the 20th of the month
following the sale. Customer terms are 30 days or more. Therefore, when Buyer
takes A/R and then collects the cash, the Buyer would have responsibility for
the accrued tax associated with any uncollected A/R under item 4 above.
